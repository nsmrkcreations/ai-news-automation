Disbursement growth is anticipated to accelerate across all segments, driven primarily by the upcoming festive season for auto lenders, expansion into non-MFI sectors for MFIs (Micro finance Institutions), a rise in gold prices for gold financers, and a rebound in housing activity following a typically weaker first quarter. Generally, profit margins are projected to either improve or remain stable for most, attributed to a reduction in cost of funds.",
