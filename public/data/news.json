He has made one appearance for the Premier League champions this season, starring in the buildup to Rio Ngumoha’s winner at Newcastle last week.

To part ways with a coach after just two league matches is unprecedented. </p> <p>This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust. A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play. </p> <p>I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust. </p> <p>Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware. </p> <p>Finally, I would like to thank the Bayer Leverkusen supporters for their warmth and passion, and I wish the squad and staff every success for the remainder of the season.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68b5d4c48f08e8bac27269a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T17:16:33.782Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>We still haven’t had confirmation of Isak to Liverpool</strong>, by the way.

Wharton is one of the No 6s with Jordan Henderson. Declan Rice and Elliott Anderson are the No 8s. Morgan Rogers and Morgan Gibbs-White are the No10s. He sees Eberechi Eze primarily as an option off the left wing, although he did say he could also play in the No 10 role. In Wharton’s absence, I wonder whether Curtis Jones could yet get a call.

Attempts to sign Manuel Akanji from Manchester City and Monaco’s Mohammed Salisu have come to nothing, so Palace have now sounded out their arch-rivals over a potential deal for Igor. The 27-year-old only started 10 Premier League games under Fabian Hürzeler last season and has yet to feature this season. He is also believed to have interest from West Ham.</p> <p>The expected arrival of Uche, who had been lined up for a move to Wolves but failed to agree personal terms, will be a welcome boost for Oliver Glasner. Capable of playing in central midfield or in a more advanced role, the 22-year-old who joined Getafe in January 2024 and received his first senior call-up for Nigeria in May should help to bolster Palace’s squad after the departure of Eberechi Eze. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T09:22:12.027Z\">at 10.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68b55fe08f087de24c734da3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andyhunter\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T08:58:07.355Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Everton are attempting to sign Freiburg central midfielder Merlin Rohl</strong> in a deal that could cost €20m (£17.3m).

    "content": "<p>Naomi Osaka turned back the clock on Monday in New York, producing the cleanest big‑stage performance of her comeback from maternity leave to overwhelm Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 in a blockbuster fourth-round meeting inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p> <p>In front of a packed 23,771-seat arena, the two crossover stars – who between them own three of the past seven US Open championships – reprised a rivalry that began with their famous encounter here in 2019. This time there were no tears, no consolations, only the sight of a four‑times major champion dictating terms again on the sport’s biggest stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/01/us-open-tennis-star-kamil-majchrzak-gives-boy-cap-snatching-video\">Millionaire apologises for snatching Majchrzak’s souvenir cap from young fan at US Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gauff, 21 and seeded third, is the same age Osaka was when she broke the teenager’s heart six years ago on the same court. Then, the Japanese‑born American No 1 had comforted the 15-year-old wildcard in a moment that went viral. On Monday the generosity stopped at the baseline. Osaka dominated from the first ball, ripping returns and taking control of rallies before the crowd could rouse their favourite. She breezed through her opening service games with the authority that once lifted her to the summit of the sport, winning 16 of her first 18 service points, and her confident body language stood in stark contrast to the brooding, stressed figure she has sometimes appeared since her return.</p> <p>Gauff’s serving woes, the recurring theme of her summer, surfaced immediately. In her opening service game she fell behind 15-40, hitting a routine forehand into the net to concede the break, and never quite recovered. She served a double-fault three times in the opening set, the last on set point to hand it away after only 31 minutes.</p> <p>By then she had sprayed 16 unforced errors, 11 of them off a forehand that was in open revolt. The Labor Day crowd, eager to lift her, swelled behind her at every pressure point, but their encouragement could not dispel the nervous energy. Osaka looked liberated, striding confidently to her chair with a one-set lead, while Gauff disappeared into the tunnel for a bathroom break.</p> <p>“I felt it was the best I served all tournament,” Gauff said. “A lot of aces. Yeah, there were some doubles, but I thought that was a good performance from me serving. Off the ground I just made way too many mistakes.”</p>    <p>The troubles on serve have been simmering for months. After winning a second grand slam at Roland Garros in June, Gauff endured a turbulent summer of double-faults and early exits, including a first-round defeat at Wimbledon that underscored the fragility of her delivery. She arrived in New York with a reshuffled team and a newly hired biomechanics specialist, Gavin MacMillan, who helped Aryna Sabalenka to turn her own serve from liability into a potent weapon en route to three grand slam titles and the world No 1 ranking.</p> <p>Early rounds suggested the transition was uneven – a grinding three-setter against Ajla Tomljanovic, then tears in her second-round escape against Donna Vekic – before she steadied with a better display on Saturday in a straight-sets win against Magdalena Frech. She had spoken of embracing a long-term process rather than chasing a quick fix, but under the Ashe sun there was little sign of the assured server who had appeared only in flashes.</p> <p>The second set followed a similar pattern. Osaka, serving at 2-2, fell behind on serve for the first time all afternoon but rattled off four straight points to hold. In the next game Gauff opened with a sixth double fault, then unravelled in a flurry of errors off both wings to gift Osaka another break. From there the match was all but a handshake away. Osaka pounded through the closing games without fuss, sealing her progress after just 64 minutes when Gauff dumped a forehand into the net for her 33rd unforced error.</p> <p>The statistics reflected Osaka’s clarity of purpose. She landed only 42% of first serves but won 32 of 38 points on her racket, including 94% of first-serve points. She finished with 10 winners to 12 unforced errors, content to sit back as Gauff’s erratic play kept rallies short and prevented her famed speed from becoming a factor.</p> <p>For Gauff, the defeat was a sobering comedown after an uneven but promising opening week. She had hoped a remodelled service motion would hold under pressure, but five double faults and more than four times as many unforced errors (33) as winners (eight) told the story.</p> <p>“It’s disappointing for sure, but it is a step in the right direction,” she said. “If I kept the way I was going in Cincinnati to here, I would have been out the first round.” </p> <p>She admitted the past three months had taken a toll. “It’s been a tough post-French Open for me. I don’t know, I feel like I put so much pressure on myself at 21.”</p> <p>Osaka, in contrast, gave the appearance of a contender again. Seeded 23rd after reaching the Montreal final last month, she has now won 10 of her past 11 matches and appears to be gathering momentum with each week. This was her 14th career win against a top-10 opponent and the third since launching her comeback last year in Brisbane.</p>    <p>Every time she has reached a grand slam quarter-final she has gone on to lift the trophy – 12 wins from 12 matches at majors in the last eight or beyond – a curious statistic that now hovers over the draw. She will face either Karolina Muchova in the last eight, and on this evidence she will be no one’s idea of an underdog.</p> <p>Her elation was evident in the on‑court interview. “I honestly just had so much fun out here,” she said. “I was in the stands two months after I gave birth to my daughter watching Coco, and I just really wanted the opportunity to come out here and play again. This is my favourite court in the world and it means so much for me to be back here.”</p> <p>Asked when she started believing again, she pointed to Montreal. “I had played a match there where I had to save two match points. Ever since then I thought to myself anything’s possible. You just have to keep trying and keep a smile on your face.” She added: “I’m a little sensitive and I don’t want to cry, but I want to say thank you to my team. I looked up to Coco a lot – the way she carries herself is really special – and it means a lot to share the court with her again.”</p> <p>Whatever comes next, Monday felt like a landmark. One of only two mothers in the last 16 alongside Taylor Townsend, Osaka has spoken about rediscovering joy in her tennis. Here she found it in real time, grinning after big points and basking in the Ashe ovation. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Liverpool broke the British transfer record to sign Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle on deadline day but were foiled in an attempt to end a stunning window with a deal for Marc Guéhi.</p> <p>On a contrasting day for the Premier League champions, Isak underwent a medical on Merseyside before signing a six-year contract worth around £300,000 a week. Liverpool also stepped up efforts to sign the Crystal Palace captain, Guéhi, who had a medical in London in anticipation of joining Arne Slot’s side after Steve Parish, the Palace chair, accepted £35m plus £5m in add-ons for the defender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/alexander-isak-newcastle-liverpool-eddie-howe-saudi-arabia-owners\">Away the lad: how Isak’s long and messy departure from Newcastle unfolded | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/crystal-palace-reluctantly-agree-sell-marc-guehi-to-liverpool-35m\">Palace dramatically pulled the plug</a> on the deal when they failed to sign an experienced replacement. Liverpool had submitted a deal sheet to complete the transfer after the 7pm deadline when it collapsed. A Palace bid for Brighton’s Igor Julio fell through and a move for another higher-profile centre-back also failed to materialise.</p> <p>Oliver Glasner, the Palace manager, is understood to have been furious at the decision to accept Liverpool’s offer and reiterated his plea not to sell his captain during heated talks with Parish. There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi to have a successful season.</p> <p>The England international is in the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and has no intention of signing an extension. Liverpool may renew their attempts to sign Guéhi in January but he could have interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he becomes a free agent next summer. Parish had said after Palace’s win in the Community Shield last month that it would be in the club’s best interests to sell Guéhi rather than lose him for free.</p> <p>Despite missing out on their main central defensive target Liverpool managed to end the summer’s longest and most acrimonious transfer saga in their favour with the record signing of Isak. Liverpool had a £110m bid for the 25-year-old rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at that time was that Isak was not for sale. However, his subsequent strike and public statements allied to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/nick-woltemade-alexander-isak-newcastle-stuttgart-bayern-munich-transfer-window\">£70m signing of Nick Woltemade</a> and attempts to sign either Yoane Wissa or Jørgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to submit a higher offer on Sunday night.</p> <p>Newcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m with no add-ons. The cancellation of loyalty bonuses to Isak means the deal is effectively worth £130m to Newcastle, who paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/newcastle-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-yoane-wissa-from-brentford\">£55m to sign Wissa from Brentford</a>. Wissa behaved similarly to Isak to force his move to St James’ Park.</p>    <p>“I want to create history. I want to win trophies,” said Isak. “That’s ultimately the biggest motivation for me and I feel like this is the perfect place for me to grow even further and to take my game to the next level and help the team as well.</p> <p>“I feel like this is the next step for me in my career. I’m super happy that I’ve been given this chance and I’m very motivated to do something well with it.”</p> <p>The fee for Isak falls short of Newcastle’s £150m valuation but still represents a British transfer record and the second time this summer that Liverpool have broken their own transfer record. The champions paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the Isak deal will take their total summer spending above £440m. Liverpool have recouped more than £210m in player sales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/newcastle-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-yoane-wissa-from-brentford\">Newcastle agree £55m deal to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isak in effect downed tools this summer. He refused to play in a pre-season friendly against Celtic and did not go on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh injury. Since then he has been absent from the squad, at one stage training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, and has not spoken to the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, for more than a fortnight. Howe said pointedly on Friday that morale was strong within the Newcastle squad after a difficult opening two weeks of pre-season. Isak was part of pre-season training for only the first two weeks.</p> <p>The centre-forward accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could leave if a suitable offer came from a big club and refused overtures from the club hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. A meeting at his home last Monday proved decisive. Isak informed a delegation that included representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s financial backers, that he would never play for the club again. The Newcastle contingent left within 45 minutes and moves were soon made to sign Woltemade.</p> <p>Liverpool’s deadline-day business did not end with Isak and Guéhi. The champions accepted an offer from Aston Villa to sign Harvey Elliott on a season’s loan with an obligation to buy the England Under-21 international for £35m next summer. Liverpool also received approaches from Milan, Brighton and Palace for Joe Gomez in the final 24 hours of the transfer window but doubts over the Guéhi deal – well founded, as it turned out – meant they did not consider letting Gomez leave.</p> <p>Liverpool believe their central defensive options of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Gomez and the new signing Giovanni Leoni, who is regarded as a potentially elite talent, should cover the failure to sign Guéhi.</p>",

Last summer Brentford sold Ivan Toney to Al-Ahli in a £40m deal. Brentford have seen several high-profile departures this summer, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/tottenham-confirm-appointment-thomas-frank-new-manager\">Thomas Frank leaving to become Tottenham manager</a> and the former club captain Christian Nørgaard signing for Arsenal.

I’m very, very excited to put on the black and white shirt. I’ve got dreams, I’ve got faith and now I will do my best to make it all happen. I can’t wait to get started.”</p> <p>The Newcastle head coach, Eddie Howe, said: “Yoane’s style of play will excite our supporters and complement our style of play - he has pace, power and an excellent work rate. He immediately makes us stronger.”</p>",

Once again, he has plotted his path back to the late rounds of a grand slam tournament full of hopes that fortune will fall his way, allowing him to pull off his greatest achievement: a 25th grand slam title.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/01/us-open-tennis-2025-swiatek-osaka-gauff-de-minaur-musetti-day-nine-live\">US Open 2025: Osaka cruises past Gauff, Auger-Aliassime beats Rublev on day nine – as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After his semi-final defeat at Wimbledon, Djokovic opted to use his time between the grand slam tournaments to focus on his family and himself rather than competing. Rust was predictably visible on Djokovic’s game during his first two rounds but since his quality four-set<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/30/us-open-tennis-novak-djokovic-cameron-norrie\"> victory against Cameron Norrie,</a> Djokovic has played himself into good form. His serving has particularly been spectacular, allowing him to play the brand of efficient, attacking tennis that is essential to his continued success.</p> <p>The question remains whether Djokovic will be physically robust enough through two gruelling weeks of best of five sets matches to compete at a high enough level against the very best players. In Australia, Djokovic retired from his semi-final match against Alexander Zverev because of a hamstring injury. At Wimbledon, he was clearly hampered physically in his defeat against Jannik Sinner and he later cast significant doubt on the ability of his ageing body to withstand the physical strain of these tournaments.</p> <p>Although his playing level has been moving in the right direction, Djokovic’s first four matches have only further underlined those issues. Almost every win has been accompanied by some sort of physical issue, with Djokovic calling on the trainer to attend to his neck, shoulder, lower back and other issues. He has been frank about his uncertain physical state.</p> <p>“I don’t think there is much more that I could do than what I’m doing now, to be honest,” he said. “If the body doesn’t listen to me when I go deep in the grand slam tournaments, as it was kind of the case last few slams, then that’s a hard one to swallow for me, because I know the amount of hours I’m putting in daily to care for my body, but at the same time, you know, biological age is not something that I guess you can reverse, and it is what it is.”</p>    <p>The next challenge is significant. Djokovic faces Taylor Fritz, the No 4 seed and a finalist last year, a player who has made such steady improvements over the years and who will enter Arthur Ashe Stadium desperate to put together a signature win at his home tournament.</p> <p>At a time when his peers, the likes of Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev, are all navigating certain struggles, Fritz quietly continues to rise and eke out as much of his talent as possible. This match-up, however, is illustrative of Fritz’s shortcomings, particularly his lack of athleticism and variation. Djokovic holds a 10-0 record against the American since their first meeting in 2019, with eight straight-sets wins.</p> <p>Fritz is adamant that most of those early meetings are irrelevant considering the player he has now become: “For me, in my head, I’m not thinking about all the losses I had to Novak when I was, I don’t know, like, five years ago,” he said. “I was nowhere near the level of player that I am now.”</p> <p>While Fritz looks towards most significant matches of his career at his physical peak, in some of the best form of his life and as the higher ranked player, Djokovic is just trying to hold on for as long as he can. It is a testament to the Serb’s unprecedented success and longevity that he will still head on to Arthur Ashe Stadium as the player to beat.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A plan circulating in the White House to develop the “Gaza Riviera” as a string of high-tech megacities has been dismissed as an “insane” attempt to provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory’s population.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the Washington Post published a leaked prospectus for the plan, which would involve the forced displacement of Gaza’s entire population of 2 million people and put the territory into a US trusteeship for at least a decade.</p> \n<p>Named the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust – or Great – the proposal was reportedly developed by some of the same Israelis who created and set in motion the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation with financial planning contributed by Boston Consulting Group.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/07/tony-blair-thinktank-worked-with-project-developing-trump-riviera-gaza-plan\">Tony Blair thinktank worked with project developing ‘Trump Riviera’ Gaza plan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Most controversially, the 38-page plan suggests what it calls “temporary relocation of all of Gaza’s more than 2 million population” – a proposal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/rabbis-ad-trump-gaza-plan\">would amount to ethnic cleansing</a>, potentially a genocidal act.</p> \n<p>Palestinians would be encouraged into “voluntary” departure to another country or into restricted, secure zones during reconstruction. Those who own land would be offered “a digital token” by the trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to finance a new life elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Those who stay would be housed in properties with a tiny footprint of 323 sq ft – minuscule even by the standards of many non-refugee camp homes in Gaza.</p> \n<p>It was not clear if the plan reflects US policy, and neither the White House nor the State Department responded to the Washington Post’s request for comment. But the prospectus seem to reflect Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/waterfront-property-what-are-trumps-real-estate-interests-in-palestine\">previously stated ambition to “clean out” Gaza and redevelop it.</a></p> \n<p>Among critics of the leaked prospectus was Philip Grant, the executive director of Trial International, a human rights group based in Switzerland, who called the plan “a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development”.</p> \n<p>“This is a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development. The outcome? A textbook case of international crimes on an unimaginable scale: forcible population transfer, demographic engineering, and collective punishment,” Grant said.</p> \n<p>Trial is one of fifteen groups that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-israel-human-rights-groups\">previously warned that private contractors operating in Gaza</a> in collaboration with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide”, and that they may be liable under several jurisdictions.</p> \n<p>“Those involved in the planning and execution of such a plan – including corporate actors – could face legal liability for decades to come,” Grant said.</p> \n<p>Even in the Israeli media the proposal invited incredulity, with a column in the left-leaning Haaretz describing it as “a Trumpian get-rich-quick scheme reliant on war crimes, AI and tourism”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/far-right-israeli-politicians-and-settlers-discuss-luxury-gaza-riviera-plan\">Far-right Israeli politicians and settlers discuss luxury ‘Gaza riviera’ plan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The highly fanciful prospectus – subtitled “From a Demolished Iranian Proxy to a Prosperous Abrahamic Ally”– appears to have been drawn up by people with no physical knowledge of Gaza, the politics of the Middle East or the likely challenges in attempting to rebuild the territory as a multibillion-dollar tourism and technology hub that would inevitably compete with Israel.</p> \n<p>The scheme, described as requiring no US funding and intended to be funded by investors to the tune of $100bn, envisages a bustling port city bisected by a watercourse and bordered by up to eight leafy AI-powered high-tech megacities, apparently modelled after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/10/the-line-saudi-arabia-scaling-back-plans-105-mile-long-desert-megacity-crown-prince\">Saudi Arabia’s troubled Neom project</a>.</p> \n<p>It also envisages an “Elon Musk” manufacturing park located – without irony – on the ruins of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/its-like-another-planet-crossing-the-border-from-gaza-to-work-in-israel\">Erez industrial zone</a>, which was built with Israeli investment to exploit cheap labour in the Palestinian territory and subsequently closed and destroyed by Israeli forces.</p> \n<p>Examination of the map appears to suggest the plan would also involve the expropriation for an Israeli security buffer zone of much of Gaza’s agricultural land, which tends to be located at Gaza’s periphery close to the border with Israel.</p> \n<p>The small print is most damning, however, making no distinction in terms of sovereignty between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, suggesting no consideration has been made for Palestinian self determination. Under the plan, Israel would maintain vaguely defined “overarching rights” over Gaza “to meet its security needs”. There would be no Palestinian state but a “Palestinian polity” which would join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu\">Trump’s Abraham Accords</a>.</p> \n<p>The entire language in the prospectus, and labelling of several features, appears aimed at appealing to the vanity of Trump, Musk, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for whom the security ring around Gaza is named.</p> \n<p>According to the Boston Consulting Group, quoted by the Post, work on the document was not approved and two senior partners who led the financial planning had been fired.</p> \n<p>That criticism was echoed by HA Hellyer, a senior associate at the Royal United Services Institute who suggested that the details of the plan were so clearly ludicrous that the proposal should not be taken seriously at face value.</p> \n<p>“It’s insane. What is important is what the plan points to, and that is not a new idea: the Israel determination that there should be no Palestinian sovereignty or self determination in Gaza.</p> \n<p>“The US has made clear since February [when details of plans for a Trump Riviera in Gaza first emerged] that they are OK with the idea of ethnic cleansing in Gaza.</p> \n<p>“The notion that this would be about ‘voluntary departure’ when Palestinians in Gaza have no choice but to be shot or starved.”</p> \n<p>Katherine Gallagher, a senior lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, said that “any company that aligns itself with Israel – and seemingly, Trump – in a plan to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their homes in Gaza is opening itself up to significant legal liability at home and under universal jurisdiction”.<br><br>The CCR recently sued the Trump administration for records of its funding of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the private outfit overseeing aid distribution in Gaza and at whose sites hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while queuing for food.</p> \n<p>The prospectus was leaked days after Trump held a White House meeting to discuss day-after planning for Gaza attended by the former British prime minister Tony Blair, who has contributed views on Gaza’s future to the Trump administration and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p> \n<p>The leaked plan was also rejected by senior Hamas official Basem Naim who said: “Gaza is not for sale.</p> \n<p>“Gaza is part of the greater Palestinian homeland.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Labour and Lib Dems ask Tory leader to clarify details of alleged offer after former admissions staff dispute account</p>",
    "content": "<p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for Kemi Badenoch to come clean about her claims of an offer from Stanford University at the age of 16, after former admissions staff said she had described an impossible scenario.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP Peter Prinsley has written to the Conservatives leader saying she should lay out the specifics of how the alleged offer came about, given the doubts cast over her story. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said Badenoch risked undermining trust.</p> \n<p>Badenoch has defended her claim to have received an offer as a teenager in Nigeria from the elite university to study medicine, sometimes described by her as pre-med, even though the university does not offer that course for undergraduates.</p> \n<p>Admissions staff have also said the Conservative leader’s assertion she was offered a place on exam results alone, and was offered a partial scholarship, would not have been possible, with no offers made on that basis.</p> \n<p>Jon Reider, the admissions officer during the period Badenoch applied, told the Guardian he had been responsible for international admissions and scholarships and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/doubts-cast-on-kemi-badenochs-claim-of-us-medical-school-offer\">had not offered one to Badenoch</a>.</p> \n<p>Badenoch doubled down on Monday, telling reporters she had indeed received offers based on her exam results. “All I will say is that I remember the very day those letters came to me. It was not just from Stanford. I was 16, I had done very well in my SATs,” she said. “But this is 30 years ago, I don’t have the papers, and what the Guardian is doing is reporting on hearsay rather than talking about what the government is doing.”</p> \n<p>Multiple former admissions staff and US academics have told the Guardian that Stanford has never made offers based only on SATs – US standardised tests – with no exceptions even for royalty or child prodigies.</p> \n<p>Prinsley, a former hospital consultant, wrote to Badenoch to say her claims have been “called into serious question by people in a position to understand the situation, and I would be grateful if you could demonstrate that you have been telling the truth”.</p> \n<p>He said the Tory leader should clear up whether she had applied to Stanford and whether a place and financial aid had been offered.</p> \n<p>A Labour source said: “Honesty and integrity aren’t optional qualities for those who serve as the leader of His Majesty’s official opposition. The uncertainty surrounding Kemi Badenoch’s Stanford University claims raises important questions that the public deserve to know the answers to.</p> \n<p>“Badenoch needs to come clean about what’s happened here and whether she’s been telling the truth to the British people.”</p> \n<p>Wilson also wrote to Badenoch saying she should come clean. “If Kemi Badenoch cares about restoring trust, she should start by explaining her own academic record,” she said. “Failing to come clean over these allegations would send a message to the thousands of pupils who just received their exam results that their hard work does not matter and that you can just bluff your way to the top.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>A fraught 24 hours for Aston Villa ended with Jadon Sancho and Harvey Elliott joining on loan, but Unai Emery must decide whether to reinstate Emiliano Martínez as his No 1 after the goalkeeper did not depart before the deadline. Villa prioritised strengthening their attack but question marks surround Martínez, who wanted a fresh challenge this&nbsp;summer.</p> <p>Villa, who also signed the Sweden captain Victor Lindelöf, have added the 25-year-old Sancho on a season’s loan while Elliott has joined on loan in a deal with an obligation to buy for £35m. The versatility of all three players is attractive to Emery, who was determined to add at least one attacking player to his frontline. Sancho, who has spent the past 18 months on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, rejected a move to Roma earlier in this transfer window.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/01/transfer-deadline-day-guehi-wissa-martinez-ederson-latest-and-more-live\">Transfer deadline day: Guéhi to Liverpool collapses, Isak, Jackson and Antony deals agreed – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Villa are expected to pay about 80% of Sancho’s wages. Chelsea paid a £5m penalty to United for reneging on an obligation to sign the winger at the end of last season.</p> <p>Elliott was player of the tournament when England won the European Under-21 Championship this summer, scoring five goals. But he has struggled for game time and played once for Liverpool this season. In June Elliott said he does not want to be “wasting years” of his career and would consider his Liverpool future. He was limited to 18 Premier League appearances as Liverpool won the title last season, 16 of them as a substitute.</p> <p>Martínez, who is now on international duty with Argentina before World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Ecuador, was willing to depart Villa this summer and while Manchester United had a loan inquiry dismissed earlier in the window, the club did not return with a second offer and instead favoured an £18m deal for Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. Martínez was omitted from Villa’s squad for their chastening 3-0 home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday, a result which left Emery incensed.</p> <p>The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open until a week on Wednesday and Thursday respectively but Martínez, who turns 33 on Tuesday, is not thought to be keen and Villa are yet to receive any bids. Martínez would need to be registered by 11pm on Tuesday in order to represent a club in the Champions League. Marco Bizot, signed this summer from Brest as a No 2, started against Palace in place of Martínez but conceded a first-half penalty, which resulted in the first of Palace’s three goals.</p> <p>Lindelöf was a free agent after leaving United in the summer at the end of his contract after eight seasons. The 31-year-old defender, who can play at centre-back and right-back, has signed a two-year contract. Villa had been keen on a move for the 19-year-old Jaydee Canvot earlier in the window but the Toulouse centre-back joined Palace in a £23m deal.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Not too many players are capable of upstaging Mohamed Salah but, last month, Alexander Isak revelled in revealing that rare ability.</p> <p>Salah had assumed centre stage at Manchester’s Opera House and, as the latest recipient of the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year award, was preparing to deliver an eagerly awaited acceptance speech when he lost a previously rapt audience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/newcastle-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-yoane-wissa-from-brentford\">Newcastle agree £55m deal to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Numerous discreet vibrations from phones switched to silent had transmitted the news of Isak posting a particularly provocative Instagram message. In accusing Newcastle of breaking promises and leaving a relationship severed, it reduced even Liverpool’s Egypt forward to a mere warm-up act before the night’s main event.</p> <p>Isak has always possessed the knack of timing his runs to perfection and now the Sweden striker had picked precisely the right, high-profile moment to pave the final stretch of an albeit still arduous path towards joining Salah at Anfield. His Instagram message certainly blindsided St James’ Park executives while virtually extinguishing increasingly faint hopes that a player then refusing to either train with or play for Newcastle could somehow be “reintegrated” into Eddie Howe’s squad.</p> <p>Rather like a centre-half panicking in the face of one of Isak’s penalty-area advances, Newcastle’s majority owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lunged in with a bullish statement of their own insisting that their £63m signing from Real Sociedad three years ago was going nowhere. There were briefings that Isak’s social media-powered hand grenade had blown up in his face but they would ultimately prove wide of the mark. Behind the public intransigence reflecting their own desperation to save face, Newcastle knew that the endgame of a long-running saga was under way.</p> <p>It all started when, in the spring of 2024, the former minority owner Amanda Staveley informed Isak he would be awarded an enhanced contract that summer. Then in the June, Staveley lost an internal power struggle with Newcastle’s now outgoing chief executive, Darren Eales, and was ousted by the Saudis.</p> <p>The upset extended to Howe and his players. Staveley’s communication skills were so strong and her emotional intelligence so high that friends speak of the financier’s uncanny ability to persuade initially sceptical footballers that Newcastle is England’s finest city.</p> <p>Howe does not dispense trust easily but he knew he could rely on a woman whose in-depth knowledge of the Arab world and its distinctive business culture enabled her to understand PIF’s thinking in a way others could not.</p> <p>Her exit coincided with the arrival of the more abrasive Paul Mitchell as Newcastle’s sporting director. He would stay less than a year but one of his first acts was persuading Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s Riyadh‑based chair, to revoke the decision to improve Isak’s £140,000 a week contract.</p>    <p>No matter that he had four years left on his current deal and Newcastle were struggling to avoid breaching Premier League spending rules, the striker was incandescent.</p> <p>Howe would later speak repeatedly of a “very difficult” summer and an “unsettled” dressing room as Newcastle opened last season slowly, with Isak scoring once in the opening seven games. That he ended it having scored 27 times in all competitions as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/29/newcastle-revels-in-silverware-success-as-history-boys-parade-carabao-cup\">Newcastle won the Carabao Cup</a> and qualified for the Champions League speaks volumes for the manager’s soft leadership skills.</p> <p>It was, however, noticeable that Isak’s form dipped after the cup triumph. Howe has rebutted claims he told him he could leave this summer but it is understood a June training ground meeting involving the striker, his representatives and the manager ended badly.</p> <p>By now the Saudis were happy to improve his contract but the Swede wanted more than the £200,000 weekly wage on offer and his desire to join Liverpool was highlighted during a difficult training camp near Salzburg in early July. Divisions were understood to be drawn between players critical of the 25-year-old and sympathetic friends including Sven Botman and Joe Willock.</p> <p>Howe has since said squad morale is now “very strong” but the first two weeks of pre-season training were tricky. Perhaps coincidentally that was the fortnight Isak spent with Newcastle before dodging Newcastle’s summer tour to Singapore and South Korea and working out alone in Spain for a week without managerial permission.</p> <p>After returning, Isak declined all Howe’s offers of reintegration, was told to stay away from a club bonding barbecue and trained in isolation from his teammates, kicking balls repeatedly into empty goals and against a rebound wall.</p> <p>Privately, Newcastle’s determination to retain Isak was softening. The only problem was that with a series of strikers including Hugo Ekitiké and Benjamin Sesko rejecting moves to St James’ they could not find a suitable replacement, let alone the desired two. Moreover the Saudis regarded Liverpool’s initial £110m offer for Isak as an insult.</p>    <p>Fast forward to late last Monday afternoon back in Darras Hall, an affluent Northumberland enclave, eight miles north-west of the city where a Saudi delegation joined Newcastle’s minority owner Jamie Reuben on a visit to a property hidden behind the high hedges and opaque security gates that characterise north-east England’s wealthiest neighbourhood.</p> <p>Inside the house Isak and his representatives, most notably his uncompromising Serbian adviser, Vlado Lemic, informed their guests he had no intention of wearing black and white stripes again. Within 45 minutes Reuben and co were driving back to St James’ Park where Howe’s team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/25/newcastle-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">lost 3-2 against Liverpool</a> later that bank holiday Monday evening.</p> <p>At that point the manager had not spoken to his supposed star striker for almost a fortnight and was reiterating that he “only wanted” players “fully committed to Newcastle”. It finally proved the cue for Rumayyan, making a rare trip to Tyneside, to sanction a successful £70m move for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/28/newcastle-nick-woltemade-deal-sign-stuttgart-germany-alexander-isak-liverpool\">Stuttgart’s Germany striker Nick Woltemade</a>.</p> <p>By Saturday evening Howe diplomatically refused to deny reports from Sweden that Isak had already bid his former teammates farewell. The longest, and messiest, of goodbyes was almost over, leaving the Saudis stung by suggestions that even Newcastle’s former and unlamented owner Mike Ashley would have handled things infinitely better.</p>",

Jackson had already flown to Germany to complete a loan with a €65m option to buy and refused to budge when he was told to return to London. The 24-year-old, who has fallen down the pecking order following the arrivals of Delap and João Pedro this summer, remained in Munich but his hopes of joining Bayern appeared to be over at the end of the weekend.</p> <p>Jackson emerged as a possible target for Newcastle when they accepted Liverpool’s offer for Alexander Isak on Sunday night, only for that path to close when the north-east club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/newcastle-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-yoane-wissa-from-brentford\">agreed to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissa</a> on Monday morning.</p> <p>Optimism then rose when it emerged that Bayern were making another push for the Senegal international. Chelsea were hopeful for a permanent sale but a compromise was reached. Bayern are paying a €16.5m loan fee in one chunk and the obligation to buy will be triggered by Jackson making a certain number of appearances this season for Vincent Kompany’s team.</p> <p>It was a slow deadline day in terms of incomings at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea recalled Marc Guiu from his loan at Sunderland to provide cover up front and completed a loan deal for the Brighton attacker Facundo Buonanotte. They did not pursue interest in Barcelona’s Fermin López.</p> <p>Attempts to find buyers for Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi were harder. Chilwell agreed a permanent move to Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, on a two-year deal. But West Ham were unable to agree a loan for Disasi, the French centre back, and Sterling was left in limbo after interest in him failed to materialise. The former England winger has two years left on a deal worth over £325,000 a week.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When a cleaner starts working for a wealthy woman, she gets sucked in by a luxury mansion bursting with secrets. Get the popcorn ready for a preposterous world of locked rooms, creepy gardeners … and bodies</p>",
    "content": "<p>The writer Matthew Barry and director Ashley Way gave us one of the highlights of 2023’s television output in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/29/men-up-review-drug-viagra-masterpiece-tv\">Men Up</a>, a witty, moving, compassionate treat of a drama about the development of the drug that would become known as Viagra and the group of Welshmen who were among its first guinea pigs.</p> <p>Their new offering is a more straightforward one, and if it doesn’t achieve the same success Men Up did, they can hardly be condemned for having set their bar so high.</p> <p>The Guest is a fast, furious, preposterous thriller of the kind that you can only pull off if everyone involved in its creation and consumption approaches it without an ounce of cynicism. Barry, Way and the high-calibre cast hold up their end of the bargain, delivering bags of propulsive plot. Viewers must hold up theirs via uncritical acceptance of the multiple twists, and bring along enough metaphorical or actual popcorn for the ride.</p> <p>Thus will happiness ensue as we embark on the tale of young have-not Ria (Gabrielle Creevy, in a really fine performance that does much to prevent the whole thing flying off the rails). She is working as a cleaner for various horrible people who fire her as soon as someone cheaper comes along (“If you’re going to be funny about it, let’s just call it a day, shall we?”), supporting Lee (Sion Daniel Young), the deadbeat boyfriend she has had since school, and stealing food so she can pay their rent on a grim illegal sublet while he complains about the lack of jobs. Into this unrewarding life arrives Fran (Eve Myles), a rich, self-made businesswoman and apparent fairy godmother. She offers Ria a four-day-a-week cleaning job at her luxurious mansion for decent wages and gives her inspirational speeches, which stir the longings and ambitions in Ria that have lain dormant since her mother died while Ria was still at school.</p>    <p>Of course, Fran could be all benevolence, but a glimpse of a shadowy figure in the supposedly empty guesthouse, and the ominous strings scoring every scene Fran is in, tell the astute watcher otherwise, even before the aged gardener, Derek (Clive Russell), tells her to get out of there while she still can. It’s probably his memory going, though. It’s almost certainly nothing to do with the permanently locked room in the mansion, the imports Mr Fran is constantly sourcing abroad and sending home, or Fran having an affair with Derek’s son. Nor dropping hints about domestic violence or insisting that her childlessness is a happy choice she made so that she and her unsettling husband could concentrate on the business.</p> <p>Soon, Fran is offering her more money, more responsibility, more inspirational speeches, more clothes from her wardrobe, giving her pills from her stash and installing Ria in the guesthouse. She also encourages her protege to join dating apps to see what improvements Ria can make on the boyfriend situation now that Fran has shown her what she’s truly worth. A guy called Mike Rice (Joseph Ollman) seems nice!</p> <p>Not that Ria is a sap. She has an instinct for self-preservation (quietly whipping out her phone to record Fran and her lover shagging in the kitchen, though this may just be a reminder to double-Dettol the place rather than as future blackmail material) and enough smarts to keep her from being the kind of heroine you find yourself shouting at in frustration.</p> <p>With a sense of glorious inevitability, we move into a world of broken banisters and bodies, Instagram clues, police suspicions, hidden diaries, rolls of ready cash and more, while Fran and Ria’s relationship grows more twisted, more intense. The question of quite how dangerous it is to know each of them becomes more pressing.</p> <p>Oh, I almost forgot (I’m sorry – there is a <em>lot</em> going on)! What of the previous cleaner, Anna, who was also promoted to Fran’s assistant, given a makeover, supplied with lots of pills and installed in the guesthouse? Why would anyone give that cushy number up? I’m sure there is not a reasonable explanation, and you will be too if you’ve gone into this with the right attitude, as recommended above.</p> <p>All four ridiculous, well-played, well-paced episodes slip down a treat. There’s nothing hugely earth-shattering or innovative here – apart from the sheer volume of plot contained therein – but you will have fun. That much I promise you.</p> <p>• The Guest aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Manchester United completed the signing of Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for €21m (£18m) plus add-ons on transfer deadline day, choosing him over Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez to strengthen Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping options. The 22-year-old is United’s fourth major signing of the widow, following Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, to take the club’s summer spending to £225.2m</p> <p>Lammens travelled to Manchester on Monday afternoon prior to signing a five-year contract. United consider Lammens, who has nine caps for Belgium’s Under-21 side, a prospect for the future who can also challenge André Onana or<strong> </strong>Altay Bayindir for the No 1 spot immediately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/01/transfer-deadline-day-guehi-wissa-martinez-ederson-latest-and-more-live\">Transfer deadline day: Isak and Wissa deals agreed; Sancho, Jackson, Donnarumma and more – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United,” said Lammens. “It is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.</p> <p>“You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years. I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”</p> <p>United had considered signing Martínez but the Argentina World Cup-winner’s £35m asking price and age – he turns 33 on Tuesday – ultimately made Lammens the club’s favoured option. With Tom Heaton also at United, Lammens’ arrival means Amorim has four goalkeepers. As Onana is expected to be part of Cameroon’s African Cup of Nations challenge for up to six weeks, starting in mid-December, the Portuguese is relaxed about having to manage the quartet.</p> <p>Following a troubled three years at United, Antony was sold to Real Betis for a €25m (£21.6m) package that includes a 50% sell-on clause. United also offloaded Jadon Sancho to Aston Villa on a season-long loan that sees the Midlands club cover 80% of the winger’s wages. Rasmus Højlund also secured a season-long loan move to Napoli that includes an obligation for the Serie A champions to sign the Denmark forward on a permanent basis if they qualify for the Champions League.</p> <p>United ended the window with no new midfield acquisitions, though they made an enquiry to Atlético Madrid regarding the availability to Connor Gallager, while Kobbie Mainoo’s wish to leave on loan was not granted. Tyrell Malacia was also not able to secure a move away from Old Trafford.</p>",

Monarez said through lawyers the clash came after she refused to sign off on Kennedy’s directives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/rfk-jr-vaccine-injury-compensation\">RFK Jr says he’ll ‘fix’ a vaccine program - by canceling compensation for people with vaccine injuries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the essay, titled We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is Endangering Every American’s Health, the former leaders, including Rochelle P Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health emergencies”.</p> <p>The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views”.</p> <p>The letter comes as the Trump administration is pushing back on criticism of Kennedy’s leadership. </p> <p>The White House said last week that Trump and Kennedy aim to make the agency “more public-facing” and “more accountable,” and that they would be “strengthening our public health system and restoring it to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases, investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats”.</p> <p>The arguments over the direction of the CDC center in part on disagreements over vaccination policies.</p> <p>Monarez was reportedly fired after clashing with Kennedy over vaccine policy.</p> <p>In a sign that it is a debate even Trump can’t escape, the president on Monday <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115128985245605660\">in a Truth Social post </a> called on pharmaceutical companies to “justify” the success of the Covid vaccines that were initiated during his first term.</p> <p>“Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives.

O’Neill is a biotech investor and former speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush administration. He can only serve as an interim leader of the agency until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.</p> <p>Following Monarez’s firing, hundreds of CDC staffers rallied outside the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta in protest.

    "content": "<p>Thomas Frank has completed a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Randal Kolo Muani to boost his attacking options – and deepen his Champions League squad selection headache.</p> <p>Kolo Muani had been a prime target for Juventus, for whom he played on loan from PSG over the second half of last season, scoring 10 goals. But the Serie A club were unable to agree a deal for him, admitting defeat over the weekend and moving instead for Loïs Openda from RB Leipzig.</p> <p>Spurs had been interested in Kolo Muani in January when Ange Postecoglou was their manager. They have now moved decisively to secure him on a season-long contract with no obligation to make things permanent next summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/sep/01/transfer-deadline-day-guehi-wissa-martinez-ederson-latest-and-more-live\">Transfer deadline day: City agree Donnarumma deal, Guéhi to Liverpool move collapses – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kolo Muani, who has 31 caps and nine goals for France, can play up front or off the left. The 26-year-old cost €75m plus €15m in add-ons when he joined PSG in 2023 from Eintracht Frankfurt and Spurs will register him as a non locally-trained senior player in the Champions League.</p> <p>The club already had too many of this profile of player; they are permitted to name up to 17 of them on their 25-man “A”’ list. A further complication is that they are allowed to have only four association-trained players and they have six – Djed Spence, Ben Davies, Archie Gray, James Maddison, Brennan Johnson and Dominic Solanke.</p> <p>Maddison has a long-term injuryand will not be available for the league phase of the Champions League, which concludes at the end of January. Clubs can register a maximum of three new players for the knockout rounds. If Frank wanted to include each of the other five, one of them would have to take a non locally-trained spot.</p> <p>Uefa’s deadline for the submission of Champion League squads is 11pm BST on Tuesday and Frank is likely to have to omit a clutch of players. When the nailed-on selections are factored in, it would appear that Frank will have to choose two from the following – Radu Dragusin, the new signing Kota Takai, Dejan Kulusevski, Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and the odd one out from the association-trained group. This group does not include Yves Bissouma, who is out of favour and has been linked with a move to Turkey, where the transfer window does not close until Friday week.</p> <p>Kulusevski may be at risk because he is expected to be unavailable until around the turn of the year as he recovers from knee surgery. The final two ties of the league phase are scheduled for 20-21 January and 28 January. Complicating matters yet further is Spurs’ situation with their club-trained players, who are the other element of the locally-trained cohort. They have only one – the third-choice goalkeeper, Brandon Austin.</p> <p>Kolo Muani, who will wear the No 39 shirt, said: “I’m really happy and very proud to be at such a great club. I can’t wait to meet my teammates, all the fans and to get out on the pitch. I know what the coach expects from me. I will fight hard for the shirt, the club and the fans. I will give everything for this team.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaders from countries united in their opposition to the west will gather in Beijing this week in a show of support for China’s president, Xi Jinping, at a second world war commemoration parade designed to show off China’s military strength and geopolitical might.</p> <p>Described by western analysts as “the axis of upheaval”, the military, economic and political collaboration between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has been on display on the battlefield in Ukraine and in the Middle East this year.</p> <p>But on Wednesday it will be Beijing that takes centre stage as the world’s second-largest economy and rising superpower presents itself as an alternative to a western-led global order.</p> <p>The tightly choreographed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/china-victory-day-military-parade-putin-kim-jong-axis-of-upheaval\">military parade</a> through Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate 80 years since the defeat of Japan in the second world war – referred to in China as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression – will be attended by 26 heads of state. As well as Russia, North Korea and Iran, leaders from Myanmar, Mongolia, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and central Asian countries will witness China’s unveiling of a range of combat-ready weaponry. The only western leaders on the guest list published by China’s ministry of foreign affairs are from Serbia and Slovakia.</p> <p>“Xi Jinping is trying to lay out his ambition for the global order,” said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. In Xi’s view, “the world should be multipolar, led by China, and joined by many non-western countries,” Yu said.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is already in China, having attended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/31/putin-modi-erdogan-xi-china-talks\">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> summit in Tianjin over the weekend. India’s president, Narendra Modi, also attended the annual gathering of Eurasian leaders, a sign of thawing China-India relations at a time when India has been hit by 50% tariffs by the US as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/trump-tariff-india-russian-oil-purchase\">punishment for purchases of Russian oil</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/xi-jinping-putin-china-summit-shanghai\">Xi Jinping criticises ‘bullying behaviour’ and Putin blames west for Ukraine war at Shanghai summit </a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as showing Beijing’s power to gather non-western leaders, the parade – two months after US’s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/trump-army-parade\">lacklustre military parade</a> held on Donald Trump’s 79th birthday in mid-June – provides a direct comparison of US and Chinese military strength that Beijing will be comfortable with.</p> <p>Wednesday’s bonanza comes “quite shortly after the awful US parade”, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It would “rub it in from the Chinese side”, he said, telling the US that “if you do parades, we can do it better than anyone else”.</p> <p>In recent months China has been stressing the importance of its narrative about the defeat of Japan in the second world war, which minimises the role of the west. In May, when Xi visited Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day parade, he wrote an article calling for the “correct historical perspective” on the war.</p> <p>Xi said China and the Soviet Union were the principle theatres of war in Asia and Europe, and that the two countries “served as the mainstay of resistance against Japanese militarism and German nazism, making pivotal contributions to the victory of the world anti-fascist war”. </p> <p>Xi’s article made no mention of the US or European contributions against the axis forces in the war.</p> <p>Several recent blockbuster films have also focused on China’s experience of the war. Dead to Rights, a film about the Nanjing massacre, in which more than 200,000 Chinese people in Nanjing were killed by Japanese troops in 1937, took more than 500m yuan (£52m) in the first four days of its release in Chinese cinemas in July.</p> <p>Another film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/18/dongji-rescue-review\">Dongji Rescue</a>, tells the story of British prisoners of war who were rescued by Chinese fishers from a bombed Japanese cargo liner, while the Chinese government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/01/the-sinking-of-the-lisbon-maru-fang-li-oscar\">enthusiastically promoted</a> a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/18/the-sinking-of-the-lisbon-maru-review-british-wartime-tragedy-told-with-potent-empathy\">documentary</a> on the same topic.</p> <p>Yu said the legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist party was based in part on its defeat of Japan 80 years ago, making the historical narratives particularly important as Beijing grapples with challenging economic forces and a trade war with the US that threatens to undermine the prosperity of ordinary Chinese people.</p> <p>Analysts will be closely watching Wednesday’s parade for signs of China’s military upgrade, especially anything that could be of particular relevance to an assault on Taiwan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/chinas-war-chest-beijings-great-wall-of-steel-faces-obstacles-to-military-supremacy\">China’s war chest: Beijing’s ‘great wall of steel’ faces obstacles to military supremacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Taiwan is the great unspoken piece of the parade,” said Charles Parton, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. By projecting military might, he said, Beijing is “sending a message to the Taiwanese that resistance is futile”.</p> <p>In May, Chinese weaponry appeared to prove itself in a conflict between India and Pakistan, when Pakistan used Chinese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/pakistans-use-of-j-10c-jets-and-missiles-exposes-potency-of-chinese-arms\">J10-C jets</a> to shoot down several Indian fighter jets. The role of Chinese kit in that conflict, while never officially acknowledged by Beijing, was nonetheless highlighted in Chinese media as a success story for China’s military capabilities.</p> <p>Even more advanced jets could be on display at this week’s parade. Wezeman expects to see so-called “fifth-generation” fighter jets such as the J-20, a more advanced and stealthy version of the J-10C jets used by Pakistan in May.</p> <p>Crucially, Chinese jets are increasingly made with Chinese rather than Russian engines, part of China’s military modernisation plan, which stresses the importance of self-reliance. “The whole point for China is to be totally independent of anybody else, including the Russians,” Wezeman said.</p> <p>That desire for military self-sufficiency comes at a time when China’s key ally on the world stage, Russia, has been propped up by Chinese economic support and North Korean troops during its war in Ukraine. Many analysts believe Beijing is learning lessons from that conflict to inform its thinking about a potential conflict with Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as part of its own territory. </p> <p>And while it is difficult to showcase China’s naval progress in a parade through the concrete streets of Beijing, there may be certain technology, such as supersonic drones and large underwater drones, that could show China’s ability to “deter anyone coming to the aid of Taiwan via the sea”, Wezeman said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer has attempted to wrest back control of economic policy from the Treasury by bolstering his No 10 team, bringing in the chancellor’s deputy and a former Bank of England chief to senior roles.</p> <p>Before what is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/the-budget-immigration-trump-visit-the-tests-lying-in-wait-for-keir-starmer\">likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government</a>, he created two new roles with Darren Jones put in charge of day-to-day delivery and Minouche Shafik appointed the prime minister’s chief economic adviser.</p> <p>Downing Street sources said the changes showed Starmer recognised his operation needed more economic heft to challenge Treasury thinking and avoid damaging pitfalls such as those over winter fuel payments and welfare cuts.</p> <p>As MPs returned to Westminster after a difficult summer, during which Reform UK dominated the news agenda and soared ahead in the polls, Starmer wants to get on the front foot on issues including the economy and migration.</p> <p>His internal No 10 reshuffle, which also covered the communications team and the policy unit, comes alongside a new economic pledge to deliver growth that “people can feel in their pockets”, a nod to the millions who are still struggling with the cost of living.</p> <p>The extent of the shake-up reflects the sense that Starmer’s No 10 has increasingly struggled to impose its own narrative, and is instead mainly being shaken by external crises, notably the focus over the summer on migration, and Reform UK’s planned response to it.</p> <p>Things are unlikely to improve in the short term, with the return of parliament presenting the prime minister and his team with a series of tough challenges, including the likely need for tax rises in this autumn’s budget.</p> <p>Starmer rejected the idea the changes were prompted by crisis, arguing it was more a case of a new phase of government. “This should be seen more as moving on to the second phase than a reshuffle, because some of the positions are actually new positions,” he told the BBC.</p> <p>Downing Street insiders acknowledged the changes were designed to give Starmer greater control over Whitehall, including of the Treasury, with No 10 evolving into a “command and control” operation.</p> <p>“There have been things we should have seen coming where the chain of command and oversight were not what we wanted. This is Keir saying he wants to have a direct line of sight to everything. Darren knows the departments inside out because of the spending review,” one said.</p> <p>“Keir has been thinking about how to fix things for the last couple of months and these are his appointments and this is his structure. There are decisions that were made in the Treasury – winter fuel being one of them – where No 10 did not take enough oversight.”</p> <p>Another senior No 10 source said: “These are not people who have been appointed to be at odds with the Treasury or alternative power bases but to work with it. The economic agenda has to be aligned. But of course the PM needs to be able to shape it. Downing Street has to be able to challenge.”</p> <p>A senior government insider denied the changes risked undermining Reeves’s position, saying she had been involved in discussions on them since earlier in the summer. “That is an analysis based on prime ministers and chancellors of the past – Blair and Brown, May and Hammond – when in fact these appointments make the Treasury’s job easier,” they said.</p> <p>Jones, whose new title will be chief secretary to the prime minster, will be replaced as Rachel Reeves’s deputy by James Murray, who has been promoted from exchequer secretary. In turn, his role will be taken by Dan Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to reward the new 2024 intake.</p> <p>However, there is not expected to be a wider reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks this week, senior sources said, and cabinet ministers will stay in their current roles.</p> <p>The communications operation will also be shaken up with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.</p> <p>His appointment has caused some alarm in government, as he did some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/16/russia.media?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">work for Russian president Vladimir Putin </a>in the early noughties to reshape his own image in the eyes of the west ahead of hosting the G8 summit that year. “I can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government,” one Labour source said.</p> <p>The political role is separate from that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/25/ex-sun-editor-david-dinsmore-to-take-up-new-government-communications-role\">David Dinsmore</a>, a former editor of the Sun who has been tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. There have been questions internally over whether either man is up to speed with the modern media landscape.</p> <p>James Lyons, Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down. Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. Joe Dancey, the Labour party’s director of policy and communications, and partner of the health secretary Wes Streeting, has also left his role.</p> <p>The No 10 policy unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.</p> <p>Stuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s priorities were taken into account in every decision.</p> <p>A new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.</p> <p>However, there was some concern among Labour MPs that the changes may not fix fundamental problems at the top of government. The latest appointments mean that since Starmer became Labour leader, he has had four chiefs of staff and five directors of communications.</p> <p>One Labour backbencher said: “Overall I think it is not something you can staff your way out of. This is about the politics and the story we tell. All the comms and strategy people in the world won’t fix that.”</p> <p>A senior Labour source added: “It’s not just a question of narrative. It’s ‘what is our purpose and how do we use power?’ The stakes are a shift to radical right authoritarian government. As progressives that’s an emergency.”</p> <p>In his BBC interview, Starmer said while he understood people’s concerns about migration, Reform and Nigel Farage were exploiting the issue. “They feed on grievance. They don’t want the problem solved because they’ve got no reason to exist if the problems are solved,” he said.</p> <p>When asked about a recent spate of English flags being draped on lamp-posts or spray-painted on roundabouts, the prime minister said he was proud of the flag, and had one in his Downing Street flat, but was wary of it being used for “divisive” reasons.</p> <p>Mujtaba Rahman, of political analysts Eurasia Group, said: “Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Downing Street team reflects his frustration at what he sees as a bloated but slow civil service machine and a desire to bolster No 10’s heft on the economy.</p> <p>“That is a belated recognition that Starmer delegated too much power to Rachel Reeves, whose political judgment was lacking on means-testing the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts – both later abandoned.”</p>",

    "title": "The Smashing Machine review – Dwayne Johnson only possible casting as crisis-riddled UFC champ Mark Kerr",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/01/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-mark-kerr",
    "description": "<p>Former pro wrestler Johnson takes on the role of man-mountain Kerr who goes into meltdown when the unthinkable happens – he loses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Benny Safdie has written and directed a solid bro drama for the UFC fanbase and maybe a little way beyond. It is about the central crisis in the life of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kerr_(fighter)\">man-mountain Mark Kerr</a>, America’s pioneering MMA and ultimate fighting champ, who in 1997 found himself in the ring, or maybe the cage, with his demons after the unthinkable humiliation of losing for the first time.</p> <p>This feature is in fact developed from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Machine:_The_Life_and_Times_of_Extreme_Fighter_Mark_Kerr\">a 2002 documentary about Kerr</a> with the same title. He confronted his substance abuse, relationship anxieties and the question of what the heck life is for if you can’t simply win all the time. Kerr is played by Dwayne Johnson, a colossus of muscle topped off with a head the size of Indiana Jones’s boulder, a body on which the only visible fat is rippling at the nape of his neck. Johnson’s appearance is modified by close-cut frizzy hair and facial prosthetics that make him look like Jon Favreau playing the Hulk. No other casting was remotely possible – not unless Timothée Chalamet fancied bulking up. (Sacha Baron Cohen could do it these days, and would probably want to play it every bit as seriously and non-satirically as Johnson.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRpnP3LZ99g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aRpnP3LZ99g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The terrible, existential nightmare of losing – a possibility for which no one in Kerr’s professional or personal circle appeared to have prepared him – causes that giant statue of a man to wobble and topple. Kerr has to throw his opioids in the trash, enter rehab and deal again with the important people in his life; one of them is his best buddy, sometime coach and fighting rival Mark Coleman, slightly woodenly played here by Ryan Bader, an actual MMA fighter with no acting experience who doesn’t look as exotically jacked as Kerr.</p> <p>In those early days of MMA, the championship took place in Japan and it was called Pride; those hugely built male specimens would snarl, grapple and tussle under this title, and a cheekier, less brand-respectful film might have tried a gag here, or wondered if there were emotional aspects of the sport which had been left unexplored. The other person in Mark’s life, however, is his girlfriend Dawn, played with sympathy and wit by Emily Blunt, who has to cower and flinch as Mark, in a towering rage, will occasionally put his fist through the kitchen door. Immediately after the loss, Kerr has a breakdown which causes him to collapse; upon regaining consciousness, he remembers the medic testing him by asking him who the president is – he answers “Ronald Reagan”, a moment of droll political significance that Safdie doesn’t stress.</p> <p>Johnson’s testy and petulant post-rehab scenes with Blunt are shrewdly insightful; he scolds her for not pruning his giant cactus properly and not getting the leaves out of the pool. Dawn realises that when her husband was drinking and the permanent throb of pain dulled with opioids, he was a sweet, loving boyfriend. Has sobriety revealed a nasty mean-minded guy who is always snitching on her to his AA sponsor? And is Dawn actually less important to Mark than his pal Coleman, whom he might have to fight for the world championship?</p> <p>It’s difficult to tell. The film does not really permit the various emotional crises and issues to supersede the importance of fighting all that much, and the fighting itself is not transformed or transfigured in the drama. Even the climax of the great Kerr-Coleman face-off doesn’t make it entirely clear if Kerr has in some sense chosen his girlfriend over his friend and his sport. The movie doesn’t reach for tragedy or extreme dysfunction, like Sean Durkin’s The Iron Claw from 2023 or Bennett Miller’s Foxcatcher from a decade earlier, nor does Safdie go for big set pieces, like a boxing movie might, with eve-of-battle scenes in the dressing room.</p> <p>However, there is one bravura moment when Kerr, in shock after his loss, walks through the corridors, politely complains to the sponsor about his opponent breaking the rules; still sweaty and in his trunks, he then goes down one floor in the elevator causing a member of the venue’s restaurant staff carrying bread to think twice about getting in with him … and then Kerr bursts into tears in his dressing room. These moments of vulnerability are touching, though I wished the film could have promoted the excellent Blunt to equal status in the drama.</p> <p>• The Smashing Machine screened at the Venice film festival.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/woman-81-among-latest-people-charged-over-palestine-action-protests",
    "description": "<p>Yvonne Hayward and 46 others, including a senior NHS doctor, charged under section 13 of the Terrorism Act</p>",
    "content": "<p>An 81-year-old woman is among 47 more people charged for allegedly showing support for the proscribed group Palestine Action during protests this summer.</p> <p>More than half are over 60, according to details released by the Metropolitan police. The overall number of people charged now stands at 114.</p> <p>Organisers of the protests accused the Met of desperation in “rushing out” the charges in an effort to deter people from taking part in action this Saturday.</p> <p>Among the latest group to be charged is Yvonne Hayward, 81, a retired teacher and psychotherapist from Lewisham in south-east London. All of the latest charges relate to a protest on 19 July.</p> <p>The protests, in which participants were encouraged to hold signs reading “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action”, were organised by the campaign group Defend Our Juries.</p> <p>Tim Crosland, a Defend Our Juries spokesperson, said: “This smacks of desperation by the Met, once again rushing out last-minute charges against a handful of the more than 720 people who have been arrested in an apparent attempt to try to deter people from taking part in a mass action this Saturday.</p> <p>“When they tried that last time, around 1,000 people came and held signs defying the ban in Parliament Square. The Met’s scare tactics didn’t work then and they won’t work now.</p> <p>“The fact that over half of the people they’re trying to make an example out of as ‘terrorists’ are pensioners and grandparents over the age of 60, including many people in their 70s and an 81-year-old, further highlights the absurdity of Yvette Cooper borrowing from the playbook of authoritarian regimes around the world by using counter-terrorism laws to ban a protest group.”</p> <p>Another person notified on Monday that they were being charged was Alice Clack, 49, a senior NHS obstetrician and gynaecologist and a volunteer with Doctors Without Borders.</p> <p>All have been charged with an offence contrary to section 13 of the Terrorism Act, the “lower-level” part of the legislation, which means they will be tried in a magistrates court rather than a crown court. They are expected to appear at Westminster magistrates court on either 27 or 28 October.</p> <p>The protests were part of a campaign to lift the ban on Palestine Action, which became the first direct action group to be proscribed under terrorism laws on 20 June. Members of the organisation were suspected of having broken into the RAF’s Brize Norton airbase and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.</p> <p>DCI Helen Flanagan, the head of operations at the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said the force was “quickly and efficiently” investigating those arrested for allegedly showing support for Palestine Action. The Met anticipates further charging decisions this week and beyond.</p> <p>Flanagan said: “We fully recognise people’s right to demonstrate peacefully, and thousands continue to protest in support of Palestine without breaking counter-terrorism laws.”</p> <p>She said she would urge anyone planning to show support for Palestine Action to reconsider. “For those people now charged, if convictedthey are facing potentially serious consequences that could impact on their careers and their ability to travel overseas,” shesaid.</p> <p>The Met listed some of what it described as the consequences of being charged under section 13 of the Terrorism Act, which include a maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment if convicted. It said employers might view such a conviction as grounds for refusal to employ a person or to dismiss them, and by universities as grounds to prevent entry to courses.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/burning-man-festival-homicide-investigation",
    "description": "<p>A murder investigation was launched Sunday after apparent homicide as authorities ask public for help </p>",
    "content": "<p>Nevada sheriffs are asking the public’s help in identifying a man killed on Saturday in an apparent homicide at the Burning Man festival.</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, Pershing county sheriff Jerry Allen asked for assistance to identify the man, who was found dead in the futurist encampment of Black Rock City as the festival reaching its climax when an effigy – the eponymous burning man – was set alight.</p> <p>“We are specifically looking to identify the white male adult decedent who is between the ages of 35 and 40, approximately 6 feet tall and 200 lbs, with short brown hair and facial hair,” Allen said in a statement <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/crime/2025/09/01/burning-man-homicide-nevada-sheriff-seeks-help-identifying-victim/85927545007/\">reported by the Reno Gazette Journal.</a></p> <p>The sheriff’s office are looking for any information from people who heard or saw anything between 8 and 9.30pm.</p> <p>“We are also currently seeking information regarding any suspect identifiers for any person who would commit such a heinous crime against another human being,” Allen said. “At this time, no information is too small to disregard, so do not hesitate to contact my office.”</p> <p>A murder investigation was launched on Sunday after a man was found “lying in a pool of blood” on Saturday night, police said. That came after a festival-goer alerted a police officer that a man was found “lying on the ground, obviously deceased”.</p> <p>Part of the site was cordoned off as on-site police began investigating. Organizers with the Burning Man Project said it was cooperating with law enforcement. In a statement, Burning Man officials asked those still on the playa not to interfere with law enforcement.</p> <p>“The safety and well-being of our community are paramount,” Burning Man said.<br><br>Sheriff Allen said “several participants in the immediate area” were interviewed.<br><br>“Although this act appears to be a singular crime, all participants should always be vigilant of their surroundings and acquaintances,” Allen warned.</p> <p>“There is no further information available at this time but it will be released as appropriate to provide for communication, while still preserving the integrity of the complicated investigation of a crime in a city which will be gone by the middle of the week,” he added.</p> <p>Burning Man has become the site of unexpected attention in recent years. In 2023, it was washed out by strong rain storm that turned the desert to mud, killing one person; this year, a dust storm tore temporary structures away, including one named the “orgy dome”.</p> <p>The festival has previously experienced deaths, including when a man ran into the fire in 2017.</p> <p>Last week, Burning Man co-founder John Law made a rude gesture when he was asked to describe the festival, saying it had strayed far from its late stage counter-culture origins in the 1980s.</p> <p>“We were going to go out to the Black Rock Desert to just go crazy, and, you know, drive 100 miles an hour with the lights out, set bonfires and go up to the hot springs. We didn’t plan on bringing any art with us,” Law said.</p> <p>But he broke with the festival in 1996 when it grew large and more commercialized.</p> <p>“It’s a giant party for rich white people,”<a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/burning-man-co-founder-least-interesting-thing-20826295.php\"> Law told SF Gate.</a> “They’re selling the idea of freedom, and it’s not free. The whole philosophy, it’s a bunch of crap.” He added that the festival now demands conformity. “The star f–kers started coming around. It’s as clubby in its own way as the Elks or some hunting lodge in Minnesota.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Luke Donald has warned the US team that it would be an error to anticipate “rinse and repeat” from Europe in the Ryder Cup this month despite ­confirming 11 of the 12 players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/01/rory-mcilroy-fights-back-tears-after-europe-beat-usa-to-win-ryder-cup-report\">who won in Rome two years ago</a> will tee up at Bethpage.</p> <p>Donald named his six wildcards on Monday, all of whom played in 2023. Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka received the captain’s call. Rory McIlroy, Robert ­MacIntyre, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, ­Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton qualified automatically.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/31/charlie-woods-son-of-tiger-hits-second-hole-in-one-in-12-months-at-junior-players\">Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, hits second hole-in-one in 12 months at Junior Players</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only change in the Europe team is Højgaard replacing his twin brother, Nicolai, representing the ­biggest carryover of players in Ryder&nbsp;Cup history.</p> <p>Donald is keen to emphasise the “different challenge” requiring “different strategy” when playing away. Europe has not won on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/01/ryder-cup-europe-win-medinah\">American soil since 2012</a> and endured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/26/ryder-cup-team-usa-europe-collin-morikawa-seals-winning-half-point\">10-point defeat</a> there in 2021.</p> <p>“Just because we have a very similar team it doesn’t mean we are going to roll out the same pairings or&nbsp;the same lineup in foursomes and&nbsp;­fourballs,” Donald said. “I think over a two-year period, these players do change. Their profiles change and we’ll adapt to that.</p> <p>“This isn’t certainly a question of rinse and repeat from Rome. I’m ­trying to come at this one quite ­dif­ferently to what we did in Rome. It’s nice to have a continuity within the team, the memories, the experiences that we got to celebrate together. When it comes to this Ryder Cup, it doesn’t necessarily mean we are going to have the same partnerships.”</p> <p>Donald shrugged off the widespread sense the US team gained an early advantage when their ­captain, Keegan Bradley, opted not to play. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/ryder-cup-united-states-captain-keegan-bradley-will-not-play-at-bethpage\">Bradley chose not to pick&nbsp;himself</a> as a wildcard, <sup>­</sup>prompting comment that the 39-year-old’s selflessness will galvanise the hosts.</p> <p>“There’s been a lot of intrigue about whether Keegan would play or not,” Donald said. “That was ­obviously a big storyline at his press conference on Wednesday with his picks. We understand Keegan in whatever role as a playing captain or captain, is going to bring a lot of energy and spirit to the Ryder Cup. He&nbsp;loves it and is very passionate about it, and whatever role he plays he’ll be very good at it.”</p>    <p>Another theme has been the likely influence of an inevitably raucous New&nbsp;York crowd. There have been fears voiced that Europe’s ­players may be subjected to treatment that crosses the line. “We all live in ­America, or most of us do,” Lowry said. “We have all got a lot of fans in America. I don’t think they can turn on you that badly for one week but that remains to be seen.”</p> <p>Donald will urge his players to enjoy the backdrop rather than wilt. “We understand what’s going to happen to us,” the captain said. “It’s our reaction to that that’s really&nbsp;important.</p> <p>“So we all have fears. We all have anxieties and we all find Ryder&nbsp;Cups pressurised. But these are top ­athletes&nbsp;that understand how to walk towards that fear. You want to embrace what a Ryder Cup represents and then part of that is embracing the crowd and embracing that atmosphere. I think certainly these guys will be ready for that.”</p> <p>Donald told Matt Wallace that he would not make the European team moments after the ­Englishman broke&nbsp;down in tears during a TV&nbsp;interview after the Omega ­Masters. ­Wallace knew he had fallen short of a Ryder Cup debut.</p> <p>“I felt very emotional for him,” Donald said. “It just shows to me what the Ryder Cup means to these guys and how they are trying to ­desperately make the team and be a part of it.”</p> <p>Donald will take his team to ­Bethpage for a scouting mission after the PGA Championship at Wentworth.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Dan York-Smith, the former senior Treasury official Keir Starmer has appointed as his principal private secretary, is a qualified international gymnastics judge – a skill set that may come in handy as Labour limbers up for the formidable balancing act of Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget.</p> <p>After a dizzying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/16/keir-starmer-biggest-u-turns-since-labour-came-to-power\">series of backflips on tax and spending</a>, some of which were blamed squarely on the chancellor, the government is preparing to raise taxes – at the same time as acknowledging that with inflation on the rise again, the public are still in the grip of a cost of living crisis.</p> <p>As well as York-Smith, who previously coordinated fiscal events at the Treasury and is well liked by colleagues across Whitehall, Starmer has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/01/keir-starmer-shakes-up-no-10-operation-with-mini-reshuffle\"> pinched Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones</a>, to be his own “chief secretary” – a previously nonexistent job. The former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik, a well-respected economist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/29/starmer-names-former-bank-of-england-deputy-governor-as-his-chief-economic-adviser\">will be Starmer’s economic adviser</a>.</p> <p>Economists and former government advisers welcomed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/01/downing-street-shake-up-whos-in-and-whos-out-at-no-10\">the reshuffle</a>, suggesting it was high time for Starmer to take more interest in the direction of economic policy.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, a former senior government economist, said it was always a mistake to subcontract tax and spend entirely to the Treasury. “It is a well-functioning department staffed by people who know what they’re talking about and if it’s not politically challenged by No 10 things go wrong,” he said.</p> <p>“Because of the way the Treasury works, it’s intellectually predisposed to do things that are not just politically counterproductive but economically counterproductive. You need somebody in No 10 to push back, and that’s in the interests of the government as a whole.”</p>    <p>Tim Leunig, the chief economist at Nesta, who advised Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor, agreed that part of the problem had been a lack of direction from No 10. However, he suggested any number of new appointments would make little difference without a clearer sense of what the prime minister wants.</p> <p>“I think all this adds up to absolutely nothing, until Keir Starmer decides what he stands for, and what he stands against,” he said. In particular, Leunig said that would mean deciding which groups to single out to bear the brunt of tax rises – which are widely viewed as inevitable, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to downgrade its growth forecasts.</p> <p>“Unless Labour are willing to say: ‘We’re never going to be a good government unless we’re lucky enough to get growth,’ then they’ve got to learn to pick some losers,” he said. Another former Labour adviser said these risks were particularly grave during tough economic times, when the Treasury tends to go into “finance ministry mode” – focusing above all on balancing the books.</p> <p>However, Labour’s first year in power has underlined the political challenges of either cutting spending or raising revenue – particularly given the manifesto promises they made not to touch key taxes, including income tax.</p> <p>Business groups have reacted with fury to Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions, which has been blamed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/11/uk-firms-hiring-intentions-remain-at-record-low-amid-rising-employment-costs\">putting the brakes on hiring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/uk-inflation-jumps-higher-than-expected-energy-bills\">exacerbating inflation</a>, while backbenchers forced the abandonment of £5bn-worth of disability benefit cuts. The removal of the winter fuel allowance from most pensioners was also almost completely reversed after months of damaging criticism.</p> <p>Memories of previous disastrously received fiscal statements abound – including George Osborne’s “omnishambles” budget and, of course, Liz Truss’s “mini-budget”, much of which subsequently had to be ditched in the face of market chaos. With bond markets already skittish, the pitfalls are obvious.</p> <p>As one Labour insider put it, the government’s task in the budget – which is still at least 10 weeks off, with no date yet announced – is to “fill a hole, in a way that makes it not look like they’re filling a hole”.</p> <p>Reeves, meanwhile, has not yet found a replacement for her former chief economic adviser John Van Reenen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/23/rachel-reeves-seeks-economic-heavyweights-advisers-reduce-roles\">has cut back his role at the Treasury</a> – although she has roped in the pensions minister and wonks’ wonk Torsten Bell to be her wingman on budget prep.</p> <p>Jones will be succeeded by the safe pair of hands James Murray, moving up from the post of exchequer secretary to the Treasury. Murray’s successor is another graduate of Bell’s former thinktank the Resolution Foundation – the MP for Chipping Barnet, Dan Tomlinson.</p> <p>Shafik, too, had some involvement at Resolution, serving as one of the commissioners on its landmark Economy 2030 review – although she is better known as an expert on the international economy.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher famously used her economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/05/alan-walters\">Alan Walters</a> as an intellectual battering ram against the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, ultimately leading to the latter’s resignation in 1989.</p> <p>Few at Westminster expect Shafik to play such a divisive role, however. “She’s not like an Alan Walters figure: she’s not an ideological person,” one Labour insider said.</p> <p>But given the political somersaults required, Portes argues that it will take serious political commitment from the very top of government to make another tax-raising budget stick. “No 10 and No 11 have to argue it out, agree, and then come out and sell it together,” he said. “And Starmer has to own it, not just Reeves.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Home secretary under fire over suspension of family reunion system that she said was at risk of being exploited</p>",
    "content": "<p>Yvette Cooper has been accused of pushing children “into the arms of people smugglers” after halting a scheme allowing refugees to bring their families to the UK.</p> <p>The home secretary said the refugee family reunion route was at risk of being exploited and she would temporarily suspend new applications until tougher rules were introduced next year.</p> <p>People who have had their asylum claims accepted will instead have to apply through the standard family scheme, which applies to UK citizens who have to show they have a joint income of at least £29,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s government is under pressure over immigration after a summer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/30/five-arrested-after-masked-men-try-to-enter-west-london-asylum-hotel\">protests outside hotels</a> used to house asylum seekers while their claims are being assessed.</p> <p>There has been a fivefold increase in the number of refugees’ family members granted visas to come to the UK, from 4,300 in 2023 to 20,600 in the year to this March.</p> <p>In a statement to the Commons, Cooper said people smugglers were exploiting the family scheme to promote dangerous Channel boat crossings to potential asylum seekers. “We need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to boats,” she told MPs.</p> <p>“Therefore we are bringing forward new immigration rules this week to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route. Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.”</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Until now, family reunion has been one of the only safe and legal routes available that allows refugees fleeing war and persecution to be reunited with their partner and children.</p> <p>“Far from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of smugglers.”</p> <p>Critics have accused Cooper of hypocrisy, pointing out that in 2021 she <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-07-19/debates/FC19E458-F75D-480D-A20D-CD1E7ADC937E/NationalityAndBordersBill#contribution-21345802-A643-4C61-86F4-2374465E5762\">told the Commons</a>: “If there are not safe legal routes for family reunion, we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”</p> <p>Gunes Kalkan, the head of campaigns at the children’s charity Safe Passage, said the change would have “disastrous consequences” for unaccompanied children trying to join their families in the UK. He added: “We’re talking about children from conflict and high human rights abuse areas, such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran, who have been torn apart from family in the chaos.”</p> <p>Mubeen Bhutta, the director of policy at British Red Cross, said: “Today’s announcement will separate families and cut off one of the only safe and managed routes for children to seek protection. The vast majority of people who use family reunion visas are children and women, often trapped in very dangerous situations.”</p> <p>Cooper told MPs that six years ago refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after they were granted protection, allowing applicants to find work. Applications now came in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications were linked to refugee family reunion, she said.</p> <p>Home Office figures show there were 20,817 refugee family reunion visas issued in the year to June 2025, 93% of which were granted to children or women. More than half of the visas, 11,641, were issued to children. Two-thirds of visas were issued to nationals of five countries – Syria with 3,808, Iran 3,619, Afghanistan 2,569, Eritrea 1,963 and Sudan 1,804.</p> <p>Cooper suggested the new scheme could be modelled on those in Europe such as Denmark and Switzerland, where migrants have to wait two years before being allowed to reunite their families after being granted refugee status.</p> <p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC), the chief executive of which is the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, called the move “deeply alarming”. Flora Alexander, the IRC’s UK executive director, said: “Narrowing access for people seeking to reunite with loved ones is not a solution to system pressures; it risks pushing more people toward dangerous journeys and represents a step away from compassion and common sense.”</p> <p>Cooper also told MPs:</p> <ul> <li><p>Reforms to family reunion routes would be introduced to the Commons next month and become law in the spring.</p></li> <li><p>The first returns of rejected asylum seekers to France under a “one in, one out” deal would take place this month.</p></li> <li><p>She would set up a new independent body to process a backlog of immigration and asylum appeals.</p></li> </ul> <p>Earlier on Monday, Starmer said he wanted to speed up efforts to empty hotels housing people awaiting asylum decisions before the next election. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “We’ve said we’ll get rid of them [asylum hotels] by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that forward.”</p> <p>The SNP MP Pete Wishart told MPs he thought the government was encouraging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party\">Reform UK</a> by refusing to speak up for asylum seekers. “Doesn’t [Yvette Cooper] realise that every time she moves on to the ground of Reform, all she is doing is further encouraging and emboldening them?” he said.</p> <p>Cooper said she had spoken positively about asylum seekers. But she said the public wanted the asylum system to be “properly controlled and managed”.</p> <p>The government has committed to stop using hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of the parliament, which could be as late as 2029, but the prime minister suggested on Monday he wanted to “bring that forward”.</p> <p>Speaking to 5 Live, Starmer said he understood concerns about migration, describing it as a “really serious issue”. Asked to commit to a date to empty asylum hotels, he said: “Well, we’ve said we’ll get rid of them by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that forward.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>What Rayner may be asked to explain about the arrangements behind her purchase of an £800,000 home</p>",
    "content": "<p>Angela Rayner is under pressure to explain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/angela-rayner-clear-followed-rules-when-buying-hove-flat-bridget-phillipson\">her property arrangements</a> after she bought an £800,000 flat in Hove, far from her constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne.</p> <p>Most of the criticism has centred on the complicated tax arrangements surrounding the purchase, though the deputy prime minister’s allies insist she has done nothing wrong and she is not under investigation by the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial standards.<br><br>Rayner has not said anything yet about the row, which Downing Street said on Monday was partly because a court had ruled some information could not be disclosed. But here are five questions she will face when she does speak publicly about it.</p>  <h2>Where does she actually live?</h2>  <p>Rayner spends time in three properties: a constituency home in Ashton-under-Lyne, a grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall, and a new flat in Hove.</p> <p>When she bought the flat in Hove in May, she listed it as her primary property, allowing her to pay an estimated £30,000 in stamp duty rather than the higher rate of £70,000.<br><br>The problem with this is that she has separately listed her constituency home as her primary property, in a move which allowed her to avoid paying about £2,000 a year in council tax on her grace-and-favour apartment in London.</p> <p>The Ashton home has now been put fully into a trust, allowing her to remove her name from the deeds and buy the Hove flat. But she still spends a lot of her time in that house, given her children live there and it is the only property out of the three which is in her constituency. </p> <h2>Why did she put the Ashton house in a trust?</h2>  <p>The Mail on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15050439/Rayner-used-wealth-protection-firm-house-deal.html\">revealed over the weekend</a> that Rayner had put her Greater Manchester house partly in a trust in 2023, before fully selling up this year. The trust was administered by Shoosmiths, a law firm which has a private wealth team to help rich clients manage their financial affairs.<br><br>Some have suggested Rayner used a trust to avoid her children paying inheritance tax when she dies. However, experts say that if she is living there at the time of her death, they will still have to pay the tax, regardless of whether it is held in trust. That implies there may have been non-tax reasons to choose a trust, including making sure that none of her children can sell their share in the house without the agreement of the others.<br><br>It may be significant however that at the time the property was put in trust, its value was listed at £650,000. If it had been a pound higher, Rayner would have had to pay an inheritance tax charge at that point.</p> <h2>Has she broken any tax laws?</h2>  <p>Most tax experts agree with Rayner’s allies, who insist she has not broken any actual rules. There is nothing wrong, for example, with listing one property as a primary residence for council tax purposes but another for stamp duty purposes.</p> <p>Some however, believe this constitutes a loophole which Rayner has successfully exploited. “I have long said we should allow HMRC to communicate with councils so they can be consistent in their tax treatment of properties,” said Heather Powell, a partner at the accountant Blick Rothenberg.</p> <p>But some say tax inspectors could still revisit the question of whether Rayner should have paid more stamp duty on the Hove flat. </p> <p>“Simply removing your name from a deed is not enough to persuade the Revenue that that is not your primary property,” said Henry Pryor, a property agent. “If you are still living at that property, Revenue could deem your new one a secondary property for stamp duty purposes.”</p> <h2>Why are her arrangements so complicated?</h2>  <p>Allies say Rayner’s family life makes her finances more complex than most. She had a child aged 16 with her then partner, Neil Batty, but the relationship did not last. She then married Mark Rayner, a trade union official, in 2010, and the couple had two sons.</p> <p>She and Rayner split in 2020 and are understood to have divorced in 2023, which was when they put the Ashton house into a trust, of which both served as trustees. She is now understood to alternate in the house with Mark, while their children remain there permanently.</p> <p>More recently Rayner has entered a relationship with Sam Tarry, the former Labour MP for Ilford South. The couple are reported to have spent time together at the Hove flat.</p> <p>Others however point out that many of her property decisions have also had the impact of minimising tax. “These arrangements are probably legal, but Mr and Mrs Average don’t do it – they can’t afford it,” said Powell.</p> <h2>How is Labour planning to change property taxes in future?</h2>  <p>One reason the revelations have particular resonance is that they come just as Rachel Reeves looks for ways to repair her fiscal black hole, with property taxes reported to be in her crosshairs.</p> <p>The chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/20/reeves-leaves-no-stone-unturned-as-she-mulls-reforms-for-property-tax\">is reported to be</a> looking at ways to tax second homes more, whether that is through a replacement to stamp duty, or more likely, higher rates of capital gains tax.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, spent Monday trying to highlight exactly that dichotomy, talking to homeowners in Reigate about what she believes the chancellor will announce at her budget later this year.</p> <p>That being said, Rayner did receive backing from an unexpected quarter last week, when the Reform UK leader insisted the row was confected. “This whole sort of hair-shirt approach – most of the press want politicians in sackcloth and ashes, would like all of us to be vegan and give up drinking,” said Nigel Farage. “Well, it’s not happening here.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/01/forget-orwells-two-minutes-hate-the-immigration-debate-shows-real-loathing",
    "description": "<p>Since the summer recess, the public discourse, stirred by Nigel Farage’s weekly press conferences, has altered radically</p>",
    "content": "<p>What the hell just happened? When parliament rose for the summer recess, the debate about immigration was still – just about – the right side of toxic. There was a pretence at least that the people coming to this country, either legally or by small boat crossings, were human beings just like us. They lived and breathed. Had feelings.</p> <p>Fast forward six weeks, in which government ministers have been putting their feet up doing not very much apart from intermittent attempts to stop the wars in Ukraine and Gaza – that went well – and the public discourse, stirred by Nigel Farage’s weekly press conferences, has altered radically.</p> <p>Forget George Orwell’s “Two Minutes Hate”. That was strictly for amateurs. If you haven’t got in a full half hour of loathing for foreigners then you clearly don’t love your country very much. And this hate is no longer confined to the far right. Even some bien-pensants of the centre left are joining in. Everyone now has licence to hate. The fightback against foreigners starts here.</p> <p>It’s a time of very public displays. Come draped in flags and colour in roundabouts with the cross of St George. Anything to make foreigners feel unwelcome. If they don’t like it, then they know what they can do.</p> <p>Even the language has changed. Immigrants are no longer immigrants. They are sex offenders in waiting. With Nige’s prodding we are encouraged to think of them as invaders. A scourge on a country that for far too long has been treated as a soft touch.</p> <p>A moment in time for true Brits to rise up and come to the defence of Lucy Connolly. A true red, white and blue patriot who had the courage to call for hotels to be set on fire while the asylum seekers were still inside. Who in their right mind wouldn’t want to do that? It’s only the last vestiges of woke holding you back. Never mind that Connolly admitted her guilt and was sentenced by a judge, she was the champion of free speech and the victim of a two-tier judicial system. Her release from prison after serving 40% of her 31-month sentence before being freed on licence was the righting of a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>An age of a new morality. When Richard Tice, a newly self-appointed archbishop of Canterbury, declares himself to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/richard-tice-church-archbishop-criticism-reform-immigration-policy\">better versed in the Christian scriptures than the archbishop of York.</a> Because what God wants is for all Brits to be able to live in a country where 600,000 foreigners have been deported. Enough is enough. Our suffering is far greater than theirs. God has always been a Brit at heart. He’s one of us. As are the Taliban.</p> <p>At a press conference on Monday morning, Dicky declared himself relaxed about sending refugees back to a country where they might be tortured or executed. </p> <p>All of which is tricky for the Labour government. Because with anti-migrant rhetoric reaching fever pitch, Keir Starmer clearly reckons he has little choice but to lean into it if he wants to boost his flatlining popularity ratings. After all, he was elected on a promise to stop the small boats, and the people crossings – albeit with a small drop in August – are now at record levels. Keir is looking increasingly shell-shocked. Yet another reshuffle, another reset and a radio interview on Monday afternoon in which he declared a love of flags. “I love flags, me.” You can almost smell the desperation.</p> <p>So on the first day back in the Commons, it was left to Yvette Cooper to give a statement. To try to convince the right and the centre that she had what it takes to be tough and the left that she still had some compassion. And herself that she had something more than a ”one in, one out” pilot scheme with the French as a plan. It’s slowly dawning on the government that the appeal court’s decision on the Bell hotel in Epping was a breather, not a victory.</p> <p>What followed was a collective display of amnesia from the home secretary and Chris Philp. Cooper began by saying the situation she had inherited had been terrible and that everything was the fault of the Tories. Which was fine as far as it went. Only she rather entered the world of fantasy by appealing to her own record of dealing with the problem. All things considered, everything was going swimmingly, she said. Just not if your prime goal is to stop people arriving by small boats. Just give her a little while longer and the sclerotic system would be fixed and every hotel closed. Not forgetting a small tweak to family reunion law. Schrödinger’s European convention on human rights. There and not there.</p> <p>The Philpster’s forgetfulness was more forgivable. Mostly because he’s not very bright and not a serious shadow home secretary. More like someone from CCHQ on work experience. A quarter wit in a shiny suit. There again, Chris has got a lot to forget. Hard to believe, I know, but not so long ago he was the immigration minister on whose watch the number of small boat crossings soared and who actively went out of his way to requisition more hotels.</p> <p>You’d have thought he might have been embarrassed about that. There again, he has no shame. Rather he just dribbles out some nonsense about deporting everyone and that every asylum seeker is a rapist. He even had the front to bring up the pointless Rwanda scheme, while boasting it had removed four volunteers in two years. His Tory colleagues held their heads in despair.</p> <p>Neil Hudson, the Tory MP for Epping, declared his constituency to be a tinderbox. Dicky Tice, Lee Anderson and the Philpster all looked priapic at the thought. Just what they wanted to hear. A country on the edge. Cooper tried to calm them down by saying that she too loved the flag. It’s become a competition. You wouldn’t put it past Kemi Badenoch to come to prime minister’s questions draped in a St George’s flag.</p> <p>That just left time for Esther McVey. The government was putting immigrants before born and bred Brits. Bridget Phillipson had admitted as much the previous day. Cooper was outraged. How dare Esther accuse her of compassion. She was a tough home secretary for tough times. Phillipson had been guilty of thought crimes. School has not yet started and the education secretary is already on the naughty step.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK has had its hottest summer on record, the Met Office has said, after the country faced four <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/30/wimbledon-hottest-opening-day-on-record\">heatwaves</a> in a single season.</p> <p>The mean temperature for meteorological summer, which encompasses the months of June, July and August, was 16.1C (60.98F), which is significantly above the current record of 15.76C set in 2018.</p> <p>All five of the hottest summers on record have now occurred since 2000 – a clear signal of the global heating that scientists say is resulting from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p> <p>The Met Office said it had conducted a rapid analysis that found the record-breaking summer temperatures had been made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change.</p> <p>Dr Mark McCarthy, the agency’s head of climate attribution, said: “In a natural climate, we could expect to see a summer like 2025 with an approximate return period of around 340 years, while in the current climate we could expect to see these sorts of summers roughly one in every five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/uk_summer_temps/giv-325548Fgi33QZNWbR/\" data-alt=\"Summer 2025 was UK’s warmest\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/uk_summer_temps/giv-325548Fgi33QZNWbR/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“Our analysis suggests that while 2025 has set a new record, we could plausibly experience much hotter summers in our current and near-future climate and shows how what would have been seen as extremes in the past are becoming more common in our changing climate.”</p> <p>The latest record beats the last by a wide margin. This year’s average temperature was just over a third of a degree hotter than 2018’s previous record, while temperatures for the other four of the five hottest summers on record differed by just hundredths of a degree. Overall the mean temperature was 1.51C above the long-term meteorological average.</p> <p>June and July had hot weather, with four heatwaves including days above 30C. There has been very little rain across much of the country, with England experiencing what the government has called “nationally significant” water shortfalls. Much of England is under a hosepipe ban as reservoirs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/26/its-a-disaster-drought-measure-to-suck-water-from-river-wharfe-met-with-anger\">rivers and groundwater run dry</a>.</p> <p>Although the summer has been consistently warm, there has not been extreme heat. The highest temperature recorded to date for 2025 was 35.8C in Faversham, Kent, on 1 July, well short of the UK’s all-time high of 40.3C, set in July 2022.</p> <p>But in June alone there were two heatwaves, making it the hottest June on record for England and the second hottest for the UK overall. A third heatwave in July and a fourth in August pushed the overall average temperature for the summer into record-breaking territory.</p> <p>Towards the end of June, scientists calculated that the heat endured by people in the south-east of England had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/20/england-weekend-heatwave-worse-climate-crisis\">made 100 times more likely</a> by the climate crisis.</p> <p>Meteorologists have said this year’s consistent warmth was driven by dry ground from spring, high-pressure systems, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/22/marine-heatwave-sea-temperatures-devon-cornwall-ireland\">unusually warm seas</a> around the UK, and minimum temperatures had been exceptionally above average.</p> <p>The Met Office scientist Dr Emily Carlisle said: “These conditions have created an environment where heat builds quickly and lingers, with both maximum and minimum temperatures considerably above average,.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>NHS equips all centres with life-saving software that will increase number of patients avoiding serious disability</p>",
    "content": "<p>Half of all people who experience a stroke in England will now recover thanks to a revolutionary AI scanning system that increases the number of patients avoiding serious disability.</p> <p>The NHS has equipped every stroke centre in England with life-saving software that quickly tells doctors if they need to perform emergency surgery and can triple the rate of recovery.</p> <p>The world-first technology analyses brain CT scans of stroke patients arriving at hospital, taking just a minute to identify the type and severity of stroke and the most appropriate treatment.</p> <p>It means doctors can then offer drugs or surgery much more quickly, with the system shortening the average time between patients arriving at hospital and starting treatment by one hour – from 140 minutes to 79 minutes.</p> <p>Quicker treatment means the proportion of patients recovering with no or only slight disability – defined as achieving functional independence – has tripled from 16% to 48% in NHS pilots of the system.</p> <p>Now the tool has been introduced at all 107 stroke centres, and could transform the care of the 80,000 people who have a stroke in England each year. The announcement came on the final day of the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p> <p>David Hargroves, the NHS national clinical director for stroke, said: “This AI decision support technology is revolutionising how we help people who have been affected by a stroke.</p> <p>“It is estimated a patient loses around 2m brain cells a minute at the start of a stroke, which is why rapid diagnosis and treatment is so critical. AI decision support software provides real-time interpretation of patients’ brain scans – supporting expert doctors and other NHS staff to make faster treatment decisions.</p> <p>“NHS stroke teams have been leading the way in rolling out AI, and with every stroke centre now using the technology, it is already playing a key role in improving the care of thousands of people in England every year.”</p> <p>Rapid intervention is vital if a stroke is suspected. Blood supply to part of the brain is blocked during a stroke and if not treated quickly it can be fatal or cause permanent, long-term disabilities, such as paralysis, memory loss and communication issues.</p> <p>But it can be difficult to know whether patients need an operation or drugs, because the interpretation of brain scans is complicated and specialist doctors are required. The AI system is able to recognise patterns in brain scans that human eyes cannot see, removing uncertainty and delays in treatment.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the conference in Madrid, a study revealed how living on a noisy road can increase the risk of stroke even when there is a minimal amount of pollution.</p> <p>Doctors advised sealing windows or moving to a quieter bedroom to escape passing traffic, which can cause stress and disrupt sleep.</p> <p>The analysis examined traffic noise and air pollution around the homes of 26,723 Danish men aged 65 to 74 over four decades. It found a 14.9 dB increase in traffic noise – the difference between a quiet sidestreet and a main road – raised the risk of stroke by 12.4%.</p> <p>The lead author Dr Stephan Mayntz, from Odense university hospital in Denmark, said: “Traffic noise is a significant environmental risk factor for stroke, independently associated with a higher risk even at low levels of air pollution.</p> <p>“These findings highlight the need to address traffic noise as part of public health interventions to reduce the stroke burden. This isn’t about brief loud events; it’s the chronic day-evening-night noise that disrupts sleep and activates stress pathways.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The home of an 83-year-old woman who drowned during Storm Babet did not have formal flood defences, an inquest has heard.</p> <p>Maureen Gilbert was found “floating in the water” in her home in Tapton Terrace in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, by her son on the morning of 21 October 2023.</p> <p>Gilbert was one of seven people who died as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/21/second-danger-to-life-warning-issued-as-storm-babet-continues-to-batter-uk\">Storm Babet</a>, which caused thousands of homes to be without power across the UK.</p> <p>The inquest at Chesterfield coroner’s court heard that Gilbert died when the River Rother overflowed its banks. About 400 homes in the Chesterfield area were evacuated during the storm.</p> <p>Neil Longden, the Environment Agency operations manager for Yorkshire, told the inquest on Monday that Tapton Terrace where Gilbert resided was at a high risk of flooding due to several factors, including lying on low land and being at the point where multiple water sources come together.</p> <p>Despite this, the street was found to have no flood defences. When asked why, Longden said the “answer really is you can build something, but someone has to pay for it”.</p>    <p>He added: “There is a feasible solution to the problem but funding, and potentially the planning process, may put that at risk.”</p> <p>Longden also told the court there are “thousands of people at flood risk” throughout Britain, and that you would “have that challenge in many locations around the country”.</p> <p>The court heard that a storage reservoir, a unit that can hold large amounts of water in case of flooding, was installed downstream of River Rother in 2018 to reduce the peak flow caused by heavy rainfall.</p> <p>Longden described Storm Babet as “one of the most significant storms” he had encountered and a “different type of storm than I have experienced before” because of the amount of rain. He told the court the storage reservoir was the “only significant step” taken to protect the area from flooding between 2007, when Chesterfield experienced <a href=\"https://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/flash-flooding-day-of-madness-in-2007-jogs-derbyshire-residents-and-workers-memories-3289029\">intense flooding</a>, and Storm Babet.</p> <p>Gilbert’s son, Paul Gilbert, attended the first day of the inquest.</p> <p>He told Sky News in 2023 that he had tried to secure his mother’s home with makeshift flood defences, which he had done for every flood warning since 2007, as residents feared an inundation, saying that “everybody on the street did as much as they could”.</p> <p>He told an interviewer at the time: “She lived on the street all her life. Rebuilding after the 2007 flood was hard for us and her but this is just devastating. We now only have memories as everything else is gone.”</p> <p>In the aftermath of Storm Babet Derbyshire police, whose officers responded to the flooding, referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which decided that the matter should be dealt with locally by the force.</p> <p>The inquest will continue on Tuesday and is expected to last five days.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Aidan O’Brien has moved quickly to hire Christophe Soumillon for big races but Moore’s absence will be felt</p>",
    "content": "<p>With all due respect to Lord Allen of Kensington, who finally took up his role as chair of the British Horseracing Authority on Monday promising to turn the sport into “a modern commercial and cultural powerhouse”, the big news of the past few days as far as most punters are concerned was that Ryan Moore, Aidan O’Brien’s stable jockey, will miss the rest of the campaign after sustaining a fractured femur.</p> \n<p>There is never a good time to lose your stable jockey, but the timing of Moore’s enforced absence could hardly be worse for O’Brien’s Ballydoyle yard as the 2025 Flat season enters its crucial final phase in Europe, the United States, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/30/jockey-ryan-moore-ruled-out-of-big-autumn-meetings-with-leg-fracture\">Jockey Ryan Moore ruled out of big autumn meetings with leg fracture</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The seven-week period from 13 September, which is St Leger day in Britain and the first afternoon of Ireland’s Champions Weekend at Leopardstown and the Curragh, includes the two-day Arc meeting at Longchamp, Future Champions Day and Champions Day in Britain and the Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar in California on 31 October and 1 November.</p> \n<p>Ballydoyle is, ultimately, in the business of making stallions, and these are the races that will determine the fees on the Coolmore Stud roster when the stable’s current crop of Group One horses heads into retirement. The difference between a narrow success and a fast-finishing short-head second could equate to millions of euros over the course of a stallion’s stud career.</p> \n<p>O’Brien has moved swiftly to ensure that Christophe Soumillon will fill the gap on many of the key big-race rides, and he will have back-up from Wayne Lordan, the Ballydoyle No 2 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/07/lambourn-storms-to-derby-triumph-with-11th-victory-for-aidan-obrien-horse-racing\">this year’s Derby winner aboard Lambourn</a>, although Lordan needs to win an appeal against a riding ban to be available on Champions Weekend.</p> \n<p>Soumillon has been freelancing since losing his longstanding contract to ride for the late Aga Khan in October 2022, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/sep/30/christophe-soumillon-banned-elbowing-jockey-arc-de-triomphe-horse-racing-tips#:~:text=Christophe%20Soumillon%2C%20one%20of%20the,the%20middle%20of%20a%20race.\">following a notorious incident</a> when he elbowed Rossa Ryan from the saddle mid-race, and rode O’Brien’s Diego Velazquez to victory in the Group One Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville last month. He also had a Group One double for Ballydoyle at the Arc meeting last year, but has yet to ride a Group One winner for the yard in Britain or Ireland.</p> \n<p>“Christophe has always been [part of the Ballydoyle planning],” O’Brien said on Monday. “He’s not tied down to anybody now. He’s a world-class jockey everywhere, he’s been riding for us a lot since he’s been released.</p> \n<p>“Wayne is having his appeal this week and obviously Christophe has ridden a lot for us through the year – all those things are changing at the moment. I don’t know how long Ryan is going to be [out injured], but we will tell him to take as much time as he wants.”</p> \n<p>Among the realistic and available options for Ballydoyle, Soumillon is an obvious choice to step in, with a wealth of big-race experience in the major racing jurisdictions around the world.</p> \n<p>But he is still not Moore, who is, according to the <a href=\"https://www.thoroughbredracing.com/rankings/category/jockey/\">detailed global rankings</a> compiled by the Thoroughbred Racing Commentary, currently the world’s best big-race jockey, a position he has held for much of the last decade. In all, Moore has spent just over 300 weeks at the head of the TRC ranking system since its inception while John Velazquez, next in the list in terms of time at the top, was the leader for 86 weeks in the pre-Covid era.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6bf30c32-841d-45eb-9fe9-0f5ccc1741ae\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Goodwood</b> 1.48 I Can Dance 2.23 Anaisa 2.58 Another Baar 3.33 Master Vintner 4.08 Novelista 4.43 Bownder 5.18 Rory Rocket</p>\n    <p><b>Chepstow</b> 2.00 Punchbowl Flyer 2.35 Zabeel Flower 3.10 Torbay 3.45 Peter The Wolf 4.20 Dragonfly In Amber 4.55 Step Along 5.25 Call Time (nap)</p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton</b> 5.10 Gilt Edge 5.45 Sydney Rock 6.15&nbsp;Polygram 6.45 Veraison 7.15 Beaumadier 7.45 Kodi Fire (nb) 8.15 This Time Maybe 8.45 Coast</p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b> 5.30 Rapper’s Delight 6.00 Codiak 6.30&nbsp;Tanjen 7.00 Epidavros 7.30 Crest Of Light 8.00&nbsp;Monsieur Kodi 8.30 Lever Up 9.00 Rokuni</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Moore had, it seems, been riding with an injured femur for a couple of months before it was finally diagnosed last week, and its origin remains unclear. O’Brien suggested at the Curragh on Saturday that it had been an issue since late June, and that Moore, a keen runner, may have sustained a minor fracture while exercising which was then aggravated when he thrown from a horse and landed on his feet in early August.</p> \n<p>So he was possibly feeling the injury already when he produced one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/05/ryan-moore-guides-delacroix-to-eclipse-win-and-puts-oisin-murphy-in-the-shade\">the rides of the season</a> to take the Eclipse Stakes on Delacroix in early July, beating John &amp; Thady Gosden’s Ombudsman into second place. That ride alone made a difference of around £700k to the UK trainers’ championship standings, in which the Gosdens currently trail O’Brien by just over £550k.</p> \n<p>Moore’s ride on Delacroix was just the latest evidence this summer – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/21/royal-ascot-2025-updates-previews-full-results-races-day-five-live-horse-racing\">following his 12th<sup> </sup>riders’ title</a> at Royal Ascot in June – that after more than a decade as O’Brien’s No 1, his pre-eminence on the global stage remains intact. His longevity in the Ballydoyle pressure-cooker, meanwhile, is also a significant achievement in its own right, as he has now held the role longer than Mick Kinane (1999-2003) and Johnny Murtagh (2007-10) put together.</p> \n<p>Delacroix is, by some way, the most important horse in Ballydoyle this autumn, as he is a son of Dubawi – ie an outcross from the Sadler’s Wells and Galileo colts that form the backbone of the Coolmore roster – out of the top-class mare Tepin, a winner at Royal Ascot and the Breeders’ Cup.</p> \n<p>He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/20/ombudsman-delacroix-international-stakes-york-horse-racing\">only second behind Ombudsman in the International Stakes</a> at York last month, and a victory against the same rival in the Irish Champion Stakes a week on Saturday could add many thousands of euros to his covering fee when he retires to stud at the end of the season.</p> \n<p>The timing of Moore’s absence is desperate for the rider himself, for O’Brien and also for the rider’s many fans in the punting fraternity, but for Soumillon, whose last Arc victory was on Zarkava in 2008 and only Breeders’ Cup win came 20 years ago on Shirocco in the Turf, it could open the door to the most successful autumn of his long and storied career.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ministers are giving working families more support, but not a new public service</p>",
    "content": "<p>With the change of season, ministers know they must&nbsp;get back on the front foot after weeks during which their opponents have made the political weather. The launch of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/01/poorer-families-may-not-benefit-30-hours-free-childcare-england-experts\">new, more generous regime</a>&nbsp;for funding early years education in England should help. The first of September was keenly awaited&nbsp;by hundreds of thousands of working parents&nbsp;of children aged between nine months and four. As of now, they are entitled to 30 free childcare or&nbsp;nursery hours a week.</p> <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is right to stress that this is the biggest-ever expansion of early years provision – described by the Institute for Fiscal Studies as <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/news/childcare-reforms-create-new-branch-welfare-state-also-huge-risks-market\">“a new branch of the welfare state”</a>. Equivalent to about £7,500 per year, per child, this is worth more, to most women in full-time work, than abolishing their income tax and national insurance contributions. Working-age parents, particularly those with larger families, have been dealt with <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/how-did-tax-credits-transform-uk-welfare-system\">less generously</a> by the tax and benefits systems in recent years than under the Blair and Brown governments. The UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/13/uk-childcare-costs-soar-by-more-than-2000-in-a-decade-tuc-says\">higher childcare costs</a> than most leading economies. So it is right that parents of the youngest children are targeted with support.</p> <p>Implementation will need to be closely monitored, however. Most of the new funding will flow to private&nbsp;providers. Ms Phillipson is a strong advocate for new nurseries attached to primary schools, but these are small in number. Families are being given additional funding, but not a new public service. The new subsidy will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/aug/03/free-childcare-pledge-in-england-in-peril-after-tories-recklessly-rushed-out-plan\">not cover fees in full</a>. Many nurseries face shortages of trained staff, while the <a href=\"https://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/content/news/ofsted-data-shows-a-loss-of-1-000-childminders-within-a-year/\">number&nbsp;of&nbsp;childminders – usually women working at home – keeps on falling.</a></p> <p>While there are many good private and non-profit nurseries, as well as public ones overseen by councils, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-early-years-education-new-nurseries-must-be-the-start-of-something-bigger\">cause for concern</a> about the way that this market has developed. As in children’s social care and special needs education, private-equity owned businesses control a growing number of settings. Last year, academics published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/the-guardian-view-on-privatised-care-failures-a-service-crying-out-for-change\">research</a> showing that privately run care homes were disproportionately likely to be closed by regulators. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-childrens-homes-cap-profits-and-dont-stop-there\">children’s social care</a>, the Competition and Markets Authority judged that private owners were making excessive profits and carrying too much debt, leading to unacceptable risks.</p> <p>Ministers must ensure that such shocking failures are not repeated in the nursery sector. As a first step, Ofsted inspections should increase from their current six-yearly cycle to a four-yearly one – the same as schools. The current disparity sends a terrible signal about early years’ lowly status.</p> <p>Another issue is the impact of the changes on poorer children who do not meet the eligibility criteria because their parents do not work or do not&nbsp;meet the £9,518 earnings threshold. While some&nbsp;vulnerable families already qualify for additional childcare, experts are right to worry that&nbsp;the existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-widening-attainment-gap-poorer-children-need-a-boost\">attainment gap</a> could grow as a result of a policy that grants extra funding to under‑fives from wealthier homes.</p> <p>This is the logical but troubling consequence of a policy whose chief aim is to enable parents to work, rather than invest in early years education as an intrinsic good. The hope must be that rules change if these fears are realised, and that “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/08/labour-best-start-britain-children\">family hubs</a>” – which the Tories brought in after vandalising Sure Start – make a contribution to these families’ welfare in the meanwhile. Ms Phillipson has a lot on her plate. Extra spending on early years is welcome – but it needs proper oversight.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Levi’s has said that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could drive British shoppers away from its denim.</p> <p>The company, which distributes Levi’s and Dockers clothing brands, issued the warning in its UK accounts, where it reported sales had risen 8.8% to £96.8m and pre-tax profits were up 23% to £9.6m. It said the Levi’s brand had “retained its attractiveness despite a tense consumer climate and declining customer frequency in the retail sector”.</p> <p>However, the accounts recently filed at Companies House listed one of its key risks and uncertainties was potentially changing sentiment towards US brands that could lead shoppers to develop “increasing willingness” to choose more “national or European” products.</p> <p>The risk was listed alongside other issues including competition from retailer’s own-label products and pressure on its department store stockists from “increased online competition and inflexible rents”.</p> <p>It said apparel brands were also competing with “more basic needs” and there was a risk that high inflation “has a direct impact on the willingness and ability of consumer to spend their reduced available money in apparel and fashion products”.</p> <p>Levi’s UK arm, which employs just over 1,600 people in the UK according to its accounts, is one of the first US brands to openly raise fears about the impact of the Trump administration on sales, in comments first reported by the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>One brand that has clearly suffered in the UK is Tesla, which is led by Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Elon Musk. Tesla sales in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/elon-musk-tesla-applies-to-supply-electricity-to-households-in-great-britain\">more than halved in July</a>, according to data from the main industry body.

    "content": "<p>Donald Trump’s imperial tendencies see the US president wield tariffs and sanctions in the expectation that America will receive tributes. Yet his latest move – <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykznn158qo\">punishing India with 50% tariffs</a> for Russian oil purchases once <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-india-can-buy-much-russian-oil-it-wants-outside-price-cap-yellen-says-2022-11-11/\">encouraged</a> by the US – has produced not submission but spectacle. It has sent India’s Narendra Modi to China for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/india-china-relations-modi-to-meet-xi-putin-first-china-trip-seven-years-us-tariffs\">first time in seven years</a> as Xi Jinping hosted more than 20 leaders for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. And it is in Tianjin, not Washington, where it looks as if the hinge of history is moving.</p> <p>The SCO is easy to dismiss: the bloc is a bundle of contradictions. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/pakistan-exceptionally-high-flooding-alert-says-india-released-water-dam-2025-08-26/\">India and Pakistan</a> remain adversaries. China and India still stare across a garrisoned Himalayan frontier, though relations have thawed since last October’s <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/have-india-china-achieved-border-breakthrough\">border breakthrough</a>. Russia and China vie for influence in Central Asia. Unlike Nato, the SCO has no binding defence commitments. For much of its life, it has looked like a paper tiger, sending out communiques that were all roar and no bite.</p> <p>But in geopolitics, appearances are important. To see <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/world/asia/china-xi-putin-modi.html\">Mr Modi, Mr Xi and Vladimir Putin</a> smiling and joking is to watch Washington’s influence fade. Mr Trump’s tariff broadside against India makes Tianjin significant. Here was the prime minister of India – supposedly the US’s Asian counterweight to China – affirming that New Delhi and Beijing are “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/india-china-are-partners-not-rivals-modi-xi-say-2025-08-31/\">partners, not rivals</a>”.</p> <p>India’s calculation is straightforward. It has red lines: <a href=\"https://x.com/johnstanly/status/1961827266457190658\">agriculture</a> will not be opened up to US demands; oil purchases cannot be determined by Washington; the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/us/politics/trump-modi-india.html\">ceasefire</a> with Pakistan was conceded by Islamabad, not brokered by Mr Trump. Backing down would look like weakness. Far better, from Mr Modi’s perspective, to demonstrate that the US cannot take India’s partnership for granted, and to seek friends elsewhere.</p> <p>For China, the rewards are immediate. Mr Trump has given Mr Xi a stage on which to pose as the host of an important multipolar gathering. <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/beyond-the-modixi-meet-why-modis-chat-with-chinas-command-centre-cai-qi-may-decide-what-happens-next/articleshow/123628830.cms\">Cai Qi</a>, Mr&nbsp;Xi’s chief of staff and a member of China’s top ruling body – the first to hold both roles since <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/are-they-part-of-china-s-gang-of-three-or-just-xi-s-minions-/7525854.html\">Mao’s era</a> – was dispatched to meet Mr Modi, an unmistakable gesture of intimacy from China’s rulers. Beijing sees the SCO as emphasising the US’s absence and letting others seize the stage.</p> <p>The implications stretch well beyond South Asia. For Moscow, every handshake in Tianjin underlines that sanctions have not made it a pariah. For <a href=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/erdogan-attends-sco-summit-with-gaza-new-order-in-mind\">Turkey</a>, attendance preserves its ambiguity as a Nato member. For Iran, the SCO <a href=\"https://www.india.com/news/world/india-strongly-condemns-israel-and-us-over-iran-attacks-pahalgam-terrorist-attack-at-sco-summit-experts-suggest-its-message-tel-aviv-tehran-beijing-tianjin-donald-trump-pakistan-8046809/\">condemned</a> the US-Israeli attacks it suffered this summer. The more this theatre normalises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/xi-jinping-putin-china-summit-shanghai\">China and Russia</a> as leaders of a non-western bloc, the harder it becomes for Washington to muster global consensus – notably over Ukraine – in future crises.</p> <p>Nor was Tianjin just about Eurasia. A spat with the <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-protests-taiwan-foreign-ministers-154545997.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEnNsdiCs3C7m5M18DL3P5cL9kLksXEmc_yeKQhOJX9XtIB6Hu0vnFuSQylkpCdsnmjL7nnubE0md0gGtbIiWmf-LJpvb1tVWMU6EVM8AHuBoZ-MiZWlYvL4m7_SyfSqbgNp4IuvZB03hnwF05SKJ_xEXfw55zaZE88Ts6tlxtqq\">Philippines</a> over Taiwan on the eve of the summit reminded delegates of China’s reddest lines. The SCO claims it is inclusive. But Beijing runs&nbsp;the show. Mr Trump sought a kowtow from Delhi. Instead, he has handed Beijing the platform for its long game – building a <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/scanning-empire-how-china-building-global-web-digital-control\">system beyond the reach of the US</a>. Whether that would allow more room for other states to manoeuvre is moot. The SCO may never fight China’s wars, but it ensures Beijing will never stand alone. That is the high price the west may end up paying for Mr Trump’s narcissistic delusions.</p>",

This will have disastrous consequences for the unaccompanied children and refugee families we support.</p> <p>Children, having already survived the horrors of war and persecution, belong with their parents.

We’re talking about children from conflict and high human rights abuse areas, such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran, who have been torn apart from family in the chaos.</p> <p>Without safe options, like family reunion, more people will be pushed into taking dangerous journeys to reach safety and loved ones.

Given that this broadly follows a recommendation from an IfG report published last year, they are broadly quite positive. But Starmer needs to go further, they say.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To move a chief secretary from the Treasury to No10 is a big call for the prime minister, and he will need to show that this novel arrangement can work. But even if it does, it will not be enough. As the IfG Commission on the Centre also recommended, structural changes to the civil service and to departments will be needed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/commission-centre-government\">Commission </a>concluded that neither No 10 nor the Cabinet Office are fit to serve a modern prime minister. The Cabinet Office has lost its way, and No10 does not have the strategic clarity to support a prime minister who must more than ever be the chief executive of government. The logical next step is to create a new department of the prime minister and cabinet and a separate department for the civil service. Darren Jones could lead the former and Pat McFadden the latter.</p> <p>That would also create an opportunity to rationalise the top of the civil service by separating the role of cabinet secretary from the head of the civil service. The cabinet secretary would then work hand-in-glove with Darren Jones to advise on and implement the government’s programme and lead the prime minister’s department, while the head of the civil service would be accountable for the reforms to that institution that are so badly needed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Robert Shrimsley</strong> from the Financial Times has <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/robertshrimsley.bsky.social/post/3lxrj2aa3tk23\">a more pithy take</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There’s a lot that looks sensible in the No 10 reshuffle but I can’t help thinking that Starmer getting rid of aides because of dleivery issues is a bit like blaming the Ocado man because you forgot to order the chicken</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68b5c3b28f083ac76452acb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T16:05:46.301Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Only about a third of voters support people granted asylum by the UK being allowed to bring relatives to the country, a <strong>YouGov</strong> poll <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/09/01/4b2e0/1?utm_source=daily_question&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=daily%2F2025%2F09%2F01_question_1\">suggests</a>.

She says the family reunion rules for refugee sponsors are not as strict as they are for British sponsors. That is not fair, she says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, the proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and do then apply to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years, with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cooper says the government still thinks family reunions are important. So family groups will be prioritised under the returns deal with France, she says.</p> <p>But, she says, the asylum policy statement coming later this year will set out new family reunion rules, “including looking at contribution requirements, longer periods before newly granted refugees can apply and dedicated controlled arrangements for unaccompanied children and for those fleeing persecution who have family in the UK”.</p> <p>Cooper says she wants some of these new rules in place by the spring.</p> <p>But, in the meantime, she says she is bringing forward new immigration rules to temporarily suspend applications under the refugee family reunion route.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the meantime, we do need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people onto dangerous boats.</p> <p>Therefore, we are bringing forward new immigration rules this week to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route.</p> <p>Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T15:17:52.023Z\">at 4.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68b5b07b8f08e8bac27267d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T14:45:08.571Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yvette Cooper tells MPs that 'doing our bit' to help those fleeing persecution is 'the British way'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, the home secretary, is making a statement to MPs about borders and asylum.</p> <p>She started by saying the Tories left the system in chaos.</p> <p>People wanted to know the system was under control, she said.

We’re not responsible for all of the bad things that happen by bad leaders elsewhere in the world.”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Richard Tice, asked about saving money on transporting SEND children to school: “There are some parents, they want to save themselves the opportunity to get up in the morning, set the alarm and crack on and drive their children to school.

It has been written by Conor Casey, a law lecturer, Richard Ekins, a law professor at Oxford University, and Sir Stephen Laws, a former head of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the government department that drafts legislation.</p> <p>Here is an extract summarising their argument.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Belfast agreement is made up of two closely related agreements. The first is the British-Irish agreement, which is a treaty between the UK and Ireland. The second is the multiparty agreement, which is a political agreement between the British and Irish governments and several different political parties of Northern Ireland, an agreement that provides the foundation for the peace process. This political agreement turns in part on various commitments made by the British government and the Irish government. In signing the British-Irish agreement, the UK and Ireland agreed “to support, and where appropriate implement, the multiparty agreement”, but it is only the former agreement that is binding in international law. </p> <p>The British-Irish agreement does not refer to the ECHR and none of its terms suggest in any way that either the UK or Ireland, or both of them, were undertaking to remain member states of the ECHR in perpetuity …</p> <p>The multiparty agreement does include several references to the ECHR. The context of the multiparty agreement, which includes the troubled history of Northern Ireland and fears about the risks of abuse of devolved power, makes it very clear that these references concern the importance of the law of Northern Ireland imposing limits on the new assembly and on public bodies exercising devolved power. This report considers closely each reference to the ECHR in the multiparty agreement and shows that, as one would expect in view of the context of the agreement, each reference concerns domestic law and has nothing whatsoever to do with the position in international law. That is, the references to the ECHR in the multiparty agreement have nothing to do with the individual right of petition to the Strasbourg court, a right which the Belfast Agreement does not create or rely upon, or, more generally, with the UK or Ireland’s acceptance of the Strasbourg court’s jurisdiction or its developing jurisprudence as a matter of international law. British or Irish withdrawal from the ECHR would in no way undercut, breach or cut across the multiparty agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>On legal/academic Bluesky, there are plenty of experts who disagree.

It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 55 boats to cross the channel this August is the lowest total for the month since 2019, when 34 boats crossed near the start of the small boats crisis. Since then, there were 116 small boats in August 2020, 99 in 2021, 192 in 2022, 102 in 2023, and 75 in 2024, meaning that the number of successful boat crossings this August has been less than half the average of the previous five years (55 compared to 116.8 – 47%).</p> <p>The shortage of boats has also contributed to unprecedented levels of overcrowding.

August used to be known as the “silly season” in newspaper offices because, with little proper news happening, journalists had to resort to trivia. Then we had Brexit, and the four-week silly season got replaced by eight years of chaos. This year there has been a slight reversion to the pre-2016 norm because the UK political debate over the summer has been entirely dominated by a debate about small boats and irregular migration which has not been fully rational. The claim that asylum seekers are posing a significant threat to public safety is classic xenophobic scaremongering, of the kind that has been a factor in British public life for centuries. (There is a good explanation of why the evidence does not support the scaremongering<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/migrants-crime-statistics-prison-zp327w8ft\"> here</a>.) But the issue isn’t remotely silly either. Small boat arrivals are a huge policy challenge for the government, because of the costs and the pressures on public services, but above all because the public want them to stop.</p> <p>And, with the summer recess now over and MPs returning to the Commons, this is still the top item on the government’s agenda. As <strong>Kiran Stacey</strong> reports, <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, the home secretary, is due to make a statement to the Commons on this topic this afternoon. She will cover various topics, including providing more detail on the government’s plan to restrict the extent to which article 8 of the European convention on human rights (the right to family life) can be used by asylum seekers to avoid deporting and giving an update on the “one in, one out” returns deal with France. But she will also give details of plans to restrict the ability of people granted asylum to bring family members to the UK. Kiran says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cooper will promise to overhaul the UK’s family reunion policy, which allows people to bring their partners and children to the country once they are granted refugee status.</p> <p>The number of people who entered on such visas has risen sharply since 2022, with just over 20,000 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2025/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-family\">being granted</a> in the year to June 2025 – a 30% rise on the previous 12 months.</p> <p>Officials say the rise in refugee numbers is in part to blame, but they also believe the UK now has a more lax regime than many nearby countries after moves elsewhere in Europe to tighten their rules.</p> <p>In Denmark, for example, refugees must prove financial stability before being allowed to bring over family members. Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-to-make-it-harder-for-refugees-to-bring-family-members-to-country\">UK to make it harder for refugees to bring family members to country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This proposal has already been criticised by refugee advocates. Jon Featonby, chief policy analyst at the <strong>Refugee Council</strong>, says 90% of those affected will be women and children. He has posted these <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jonfeatonby.bsky.social\">on Bluesky</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The immigration white paper proposed putting in financial and language requirements. Financial requirements for refugees who have been stuck in the asylum system unable to work, and language requirements for children escaping war zones.</p> <p>This will either force families to stay split up, leaving thousands of women and children in extremely dangerous situations, or it forces them into dangerous journeys. Either way, this has terrible consequences.</p> <p>In the year to June 2025, 92% of refugee family reunion visas were given to women and children. More than half went to children. Two-thirds to people from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran and Sudan. It helps integration and provides a safe route. Family reunion should be easier, not harder.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, are on a visit to Reigate where they are due to speak to the media.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, holds a press conference highlighting plans for councils to save money via <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/31/reform-cut-council-tax-in-public-sector-pensions-crackdown/\">changes to the way they invest their pension funds</a>.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> At least two ministerial statements are expected in the Commons, from Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-to-make-it-harder-for-refugees-to-bring-family-members-to-country\">on the asylum system</a>, and from David Lammy, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/uk-still-intends-to-recognise-a-palestinian-state-david-lammy-to-tell-mps\">on Gaza</a>.</p> <p><em>4pm:</em> The full written judgment is due to be published explaining t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/29/court-of-appeal-revokes-ban-on-epping-hotel-bell-housing-asylum-seekers\">he court decision on Friday</a> blocking the temporary injuntion saying asylum seekers should be removed from the Bell hotel in Epping.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> The Liberal Democrats hope to make an application in the Commons to the Speaker for an emergency debate on Gaza.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/31/stigma-kneecapping-northern-ireland",
    "description": "<p>Rap trio Kneecap may be subverting the word, but the psychological wounds are still raw for victims of shootings and their families</p>",
    "content": "<p>For Jeanitta McCabe, the word kneecap conjures not a rap trio on stage but a memory that plays in her head, unspooling again and again in a loop.</p> <p>It is the night of 13 September 1990 and she is a 10-year-old at home in bed in Newry, County Down, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>’s Troubles come barrelling through the family’s front door.</p> <p>Six to eight men in masks storm into the two-storey council house and march her father, Peter, into the kitchen. One places a pistol against his leg, just above the knee.</p> <p>Jeanitta remains in her darkened bedroom upstairs with siblings – her mother is on the landing holding the door, corralling the children for their own safety – but she can hear the shrieks of a sister who is downstairs and the shouts of the IRA intruders.</p> <p>Then she hears bangs, like a door slamming. Then silence. After an interval – seconds, minutes, she is not sure – she is able to open the door and joins her mother at the top of the stairs. Her father is at the bottom of the stairs lying in a pool of blood. “Throw me a towel,” he shouts to her mother. “Don’t let the children see me.”</p>    <p>Three decades later Peter McCabe, now 66, still walks with a limp and the family bears psychological wounds. The group Kneecap have reclaimed the word but for the McCabes, and many other families affected by so-called punishment violence, kneecapping retains its original meaning, connoting pain, terror and stigma.</p> <p>“What happened to daddy is still alive to this day. I feel trapped inside my own mind, of still being that 10-year-old child,” Jeanitta, now 45 said this week. “That unsettlement has never left me.”</p> <p>Republican and loyalist paramilitaries inflicted more than 6,000 punishment shootings and beatings from 1973, when reporting began, according to police figures, but scholars estimate the real figure is between 10,000 and 20,000. The practice tapered off after the 1998 Good Friday agreement but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/petrol-bombs-and-punishment-beatings-paramilitaries-still-rooted-in-northern-ireland\">incidents still occur</a>.</p> <p>Most of the victims were alleged petty criminals such as drug dealers and car thieves – hoods, in Northern Ireland parlance – who were targeted by the Irish Republican Army, Ulster Volunteer Force and other groups in the guise of policing their own communities.</p> <p>It was the one of the most pervasive forms of violence, said Liam Kennedy, a Queen’s University Belfast historian who <a href=\"https://www.dubraybooks.ie/product/who-was-responsible-for-the-troubles-9780228011989?srsltid=AfmBOor8uJQgz-m3C0ZKzljk6FbYlkgSZkv-_49Z7r3Cn4qJ6u7iJOBm\">documented the phenomenon</a>. “The astonishing thing, apart from the silence round these practices, is that this was green-on-green and orange-on-orange violence, perpetrated by those who had set themselves up as defenders of their community.”</p> <p>Victims typically were teenage boys or young men who were escorted to alleyways or wasteground – some turned up by appointment – to be shot or bludgeoned in the ankles, wrists or knees. To have all those joints targeted was called a “six-pack”. Some lost limbs; some died.</p> <p>For the IRA, it was a way to challenge the legitimacy of the British state and usurp its justice system, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mcevoy-kieran\">Kieran McEvoy</a>, an expert on transitional and restorative justice at Queen’s university. “It was brutal, visible and popular. There was a demand for it.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kneecap\">rap group Kneecap</a> has subverted the term by adopting the personas of hoods who celebrate drug-taking and mock paramilitaries as well as state authority. They embody gleeful defiance for a generation that views the Troubles as history.</p> <p>For many families affected by punishment violence, however, the page never turned. Other victims of the Troubles are routinely commemorated but people who were kneecapped are largely overlooked.</p> <p>“There is stigma attached to victims of these attacks, some of whom become outsiders and are shunned in their home localities,” said Kennedy. “The key is in the label ‘punishment’. This suggests that victims somehow ‘deserved’ what they got.”</p> <p>Peter and Jeanitta McCabe feel that the stigma is reinforced by their <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67992937\">exclusion</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0y76d5rd6o\">Troubles Permanent Disability Payment </a>(TPDP) scheme, which offers compensation to those permanently disabled physically or psychologically disabled because of the conflict. They have appealed, saying the Victims’ Payment Board unlawfully deemed them ineligible because the shooting was not defined as Troubles-related.</p> <p>Their lawyer, Kevin Winters, said punishment shootings were a byproduct of the conflict. “They cannot be written out of history as if they never happened. We couldn’t possibly begin to quantify the volume of affected cases. They are in the thousands and therein may lie the real reason why these cases have been deemed out of scope – money.” The high court is expected to rule on McCabe’s case in September.</p> <p>Illness prevented Peter granting an interview but Jeanitta, speaking from her home near Newry, recalled the attack and aftermath. The reason for the assault remains unclear. Her father was a diesel mechanic with traffic convictions but had no criminal record and it was unusual for the IRA to kneecap someone in their own home, said Jeanitta.</p> <p>The attackers gave him 24 hours to leave Northern Ireland so Peter discharged himself from hospital and with a bandaged leg drove his wife and seven children to the ferry. For five years the family were nomads, roving bed and breakfasts across England and Scotland and making fleeting visits to Northern Ireland.</p>    <p>Jeanitta was 15 when they settled again in Newry but she felt an outcast. “On my first day back at school a girl from a republican family stood up and said ‘youse aren’t supposed to be in the country, your daddy’s a tout [informer]’.”</p> <p>Jeanitta would stay up all night with her father, who would sit on a sofa with an iron bar and a fire extinguisher, fearing another attack. “We’d be there until daylight. In my mind if I stayed with him I could stop it happening again.”</p> <p>She married and has children but has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia and other conditions that she attributes to trauma and enduring stigma. “The legacy never leaves. To this day our name is absolute dirt.”</p> <p>She dislikes Kneecap’s use of balaclavas, which remind her of the attack, but otherwise has no opinion of the rap group. “I don’t watch the news or go out of the house a lot. I have isolated myself. I don’t know how to live in that world out there. This is my world, within my own walls.”</p>",

You remember the good times’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Thomas, the wheel will have turned full circle, as his final professional race takes him back to south Wales where his path to Olympic and Tour de France success began, at the Maindy velodrome.</p> <p>“If I didn’t live so close to Maindy or if I didn’t live in Cardiff, I may never have ridden a bike, never have had the career I had, the life I’ve had,” Thomas told the BBC.</p> <p>It may have helped that his former coach Rod Ellingworth, one of his past mentors at British Cycling and Team Sky, is now race director of the British Cycling-run Tour of ­Britain.</p> <p>Of the Welsh climax to the race, Thomas said: “I just feel so lucky to be able to call time on my career on my own terms, when I’m finishing and even more lucky to decide where, as well.”</p> <p>Thomas expects there to be tears when he bows out in Cardiff after a 19‑season racing career. Among the highs are his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/29/geraint-thomas-seals-tour-de-france-title-paris-team-sky-chris-froome\">2018 Tour de France victory</a> including a memorable stage win on Alpe d’Huez, his gold medals in the ­Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and ­multiple successes in other stage races such as the ­Crite­rium du&nbsp;­Dauphine and Paris-Nice.</p> <p>To mark the occasion, he will be wearing a fiery red jersey that cele­brates his achievements and his Welshness, and that incorporates a Welsh dragon, the hairpins to the and a sketch of Thomas on a podium, by his young son, Macs.</p> <p>“Certainly the most meaningful ­jersey, that’s for sure,” Thomas said on social media. “I think it definitely will be emotional come the final stage, finishing in Cardiff, wearing this.”</p> <p>First, though, he has to navigate a punchy race route, that gets more challenging as it nears the Welsh border. The rolling roads of the opening few stages, with finishes in ­Southwold, Stowmarket, Ampthill and Burton Dassett, are succeeded by two days of racing in the climbs of south Wales. The penultimate stage takes in two ascents of the short but steep climb of the Tumble, over­looking Abergavenny, while the final day’s racing tackles the first category climb of Caerphilly Mountain, just 10&nbsp;­kilometres from the finish.</p> <p>Headlining alongside Thomas are Remco Evenepoel, winner of the road race and time trial in the Paris Olympics, Kelso’s Oscar Onley, the breakthrough star of July’s Tour de France, the former world champion Julian Alaphilippe, and the fast-rising British sprinter Matthew Brennan.</p> <p>The former British national champion Fred Wright, Ben Wiggins (son of Sir Bradley), Joe Blackmore (winner of the 2024 Tour de l’Avenir), and the 2020 Giro d’Italia winner Tao Geoghegan Hart, set to return after a period of injury and illness, are also expected to start.</p>    <p>Although there remains no apparent British successor to Thomas’s 2018 Tour win, his legacy to cycling is evidenced by the number of young Britons now racing at elite level, across Europe. Perhaps Thomas’s greatest attribute has been his resilience, allied to a gallows sense of humour.</p> <p>Asked in July by his rival Jonas Vingegaard if he was happy to be starting his final Tour de France, Thomas replied: “Mate, I should have stopped last year.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>The small, proud Madrid club are back in Europe this season but playing against a backdrop of a civil war</p>",
    "content": "<p>The drunk, the brainless and the idle enjoyed this. They had said they wouldn’t sing, but the best nights aren’t planned they just happen, and in the end it was their kind of night. Chaotic, wild, a lot wrong but alright, like a picture of who they are, sticking it to the man up here and down there. Packed into crumbling, filthy stands, Rayo Vallecano’s fans didn’t see their team get a deserved victory against Barcelona on Sunday but on a torn-up, dried-out pitch <a href=\"https://x.com/sidlowe/status/1962221062118097107\">with not much grass</a>, in a ground where VAR became the latest thing to fail, they did watch them fight and do it their way too, flying into the team with a budget 18 times bigger as if they weren’t big at all. “Fantastic,” Hansi Flick called them.</p> \n<p>It started as a protest and never stopped being one but it became something else too, something fun; they had been infuriated, worn down over years, and then they had been insulted but they couldn’t help but enjoy themselves, protest and party in one. Three days after Rayo had definitively qualified for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/26/rayo-vallecano-la-liga-back-in-europe-25-years-later,\">the Conference League</a> the team that is not just <em>in</em> the neighbourhood but <em>of</em> the neighbourhood almost comically incongruous in Europe, Rayo’s supporters announced they were going on strike. Rayo’s players meanwhile laid into the treble winners, worthy of more than the 1-1 draw it finished. But for a Lamine Yamal penalty which the broken video assistant system couldn’t correct, they might have got it. But for goalkeeper Joan García they definitely might.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/european-football-borussia-dortmund-juventus-barcelona-rayo-vallecano-inter-udinese\">European football: Keinan Davis on target as Udinese shock Inter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Because if Rayo’s team are good that line needs a <em>somehow</em> in there somewhere; the club could hardly be worse. As winger Álvaro García has put it: “Sometimes you think: ‘How are we where we are with what we have?’”</p> \n<p>What they have is a mess, mostly. An institution falling apart, a club where the captain hands over the armband <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38574233/what-learn-oscar-trejo-protest-rayo-vallecano\">in protest over the treatment of staff</a>; where they can’t use the training ground; where the stadium fails building inspections, where plug sockets sit open, wires exposed; there is bird shit everywhere; seats are broken, toilets overflow; taps don’t work. And if there is something almost gloriously bad about it, enjoyably unique, it is also just bad. There is a risk of glorifying poverty and grime, and indulging failings as authenticity. As the statement from supporters this week put it: yes, they’re humble; yes, they celebrate their <em>barrio</em> with its consciously working class, left-wing identity and luxury isn’t their thing. Yes, they love this place, but that doesn’t mean they have to live like this.</p> \n<p>Worst of all is the feeling that it is not by accident but design, the way the owner and president Raúl Martín Presa wants it. He certainly wants to go to a new ground, paid for by the local government, a decision the coach Iñigo Pérez, speaking for everyone else, says would be “devastating”. The suspicion lingers this is a classic case of running the place down as a prelude, a justification to a move to somewhere he can make his own in a way the current ground never will be. The idea of Vallecas being inadequate for Europe is one he has embraced and echoed, opportunity presented as obligation. The pitch is so bad as to be suspicious. It is municipal, but the tenant has done nothing to care for it.</p> \n<p>Presa, at the other end of the political spectrum to supporters proud of their working class, left-wing identity, has always seemed to despise the fans and the feeling is mutual. Communication is almost entirely reduced to abuse. At every game, the entire ground sings for him to leave. That he hangs on can feeling genuinely baffling at times. Graffiti round the ground demands he go. Former coach Míchel Sanchez, the <em>barrio</em>’s most beloved son, has publicly called him out, saying he has never belonged.</p> \n<p>This weekend that divide could not have been laid more bare. When supporters’ groups came together to announce “enough is enough”, complaining about the way the club had fallen into abandonment, Presa responded by claiming this was just the <em>Bukaneros</em>, Rayo’s ultras behind the goal; they had forced other fans into backing them, acting like mafiosos. He called them – <em>his club’s own fans</em> – idle, brainless and drunkards, saying they didn’t respect their partners. They are, he claimed, the opposite of the values of the neighbourhood. His “evidence”? Their song, A Pirate’s Life, all yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a woman in every port, but should I ever marry it will be the girl who’s Rayo. No work, no study, every day instead spent aboard the Santa Ines. “They talk about working class but working class is breaking your back every day,” Presa said.</p> \n<p>In the middle, the team and its manager,” Pérez, says. And while careful about how he expressed it on Sunday night he said: “The fans have their reasons. My family are in the stands and they see the deterioration, that things could be better.” So on Sunday the first protest began, quietly broken by chants for Presa to go, which grew in intensity. As the first half went on, the banners came out one by one, each with a reason to oppose him, a megaphone explaining them: “for abandoning our stadium”; “for never listening to the fans”; “for mistreating the women’s team”: “for abandoning the youth academy”; “for refusing to sign the [reciprocal] ticket agreement”; “for dressing the stadium in mourning”. The 10th of them had just gone up when Barcelona were given the penalty with which they took the lead, Lamine Yamal falling in the area before then taking the kick himself.</p> \n<p>“I think the ref will have a look, nothing will happen … and that’s when we found out there was no VAR,” full-back Pep Chavarría said. Before the game, referee Mateo Busquets Ferrer had taken Flick and Pérez to one side and told them that the VAR technology wasn’t working, but they were trying to fix it. Over on the touchline, Pérez the coach was going crazy, kicking the iPad by the bench. “I’m ashamed,” he said, although perhaps the league should be more ashamed. “I lost the plot; I broke a screen, I spoke badly to the fourth official and I should have been sent off.” The issue, he said, was not so much that VAR didn’t work but that “it didn’t, then it did, then it didn’t again, then it did: yes, no, yes, no” – players not knowing how to respond. “That influences the game,” he said. “And, hey, look, the [technical] error might well be Rayo’s; it wouldn’t surprise me.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2025/may/28/mens-transfer-window-summer-2025-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1\">Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leagues</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the teams waited in the tunnel for the second half, Isi Palazón told his teammates that the referee, by then able to see a replay, had admitted he got it wrong. “It honours him that he said so,” Isi said afterwards. “I was so angry when it happened and I could say terrible things, speak ill of him, but I won’t. He’s a person.” Rayo weren’t, though, going to let this go, Vallecas alive, volume rising, supporters driven by another injustice, protests coming together as one. Driven above all by their team. Rayo had played well in the first half, García making the first superb save. Now they were on fast forward, every challenge an appeal, every attack a threat, everything frantic. And, above all, great fun. “It was chaotic,” Frenkie de Jong said, and that is the way they like it.</p> \n<p>Organised chaos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/23/andoni-iraola-bournemouth-tactics-rayo-vallecano\">Andoni Iraola likened it to</a>, and he preferred more chaos to more control. Pérez, his assistant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/19/bournemouths-loss-is-ligas-gain-as-inigo-perezs-rayo-hold-real-madrid\">denied a work permit</a> by the UK home office, has taken that on, volume over precision, no bus parking. He had also, Isi said, seen what he called the “Flick Line”, Rayo’s players pouring into the space behind the Barcelona back line. The team that beat Xavi Hernández twice, that got Ronald Koeman the sack, now took Flick to the edge. And when Fran Pérez, the only new player to cost anything this summer at €1m, slipped into what he called “the binman’s zone” at the back post and smashed a side-footed volley in off the bar, they had deserved it. They had deserved more, Joan García making a couple of sensational saves, Isi delivering an outrageous assist for Jorge de Frutos for one of them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0ec4d959-41b8-4103-b16e-cc08c9920e20\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Elche 2-0 Levante, Valencia 3-0 Getafe, Alavés 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Oviedo 1-0 Real Sociedad, Girona 0-2 Sevilla, Real Madrid 2-1 Mallorca, Celta Vigo 1-0 Villarreal, Real Betis 1-2 Athletic Club, Espanyol 1-0 Osasuna, Rayo Vallecano 1-1 Barcelona</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“We played aggressive football, we didn’t stop, we kept going forward,” Chavarría said. “The manager was very clear about how we could hurt them and we carried that out to perfection; we made loads of chances and deserved all three points.”</p> \n<p>Flick said: “It’s amazing the work Peréz has done with them; they’re very intense.”</p> \n<p>At the end, they stood before the fans in the end, communion complete. They had come to have their say; the president had called them idle, drunkards and brainless but players and fans had a ball. “At the moment, I’ve got a slightly bitter taste. I think we deserved to win but in in a few hours’ time we’ll be pleased with what we have done,” Pérez said. Outside, way after midnight the fans waited by the gate for the players. nside the banners still hung across the stand.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

    "content": "<p>Revolut employees are in line for a payout bonanza after the UK fintech firm launched a share sale that has pushed its valuation up by two-thirds to $75bn (£55bn).</p> <p>The secondary sale, which prices each share at $1,381.06, will secure the finance app’s position as one of the world’s most valuable fintech firms.</p> <p>Employees will be allowed to sell up to 20% of their personal holdings to new and existing investors over the coming weeks, with payouts likely to follow in the early autumn.</p> <p>The secondary share sale, which was announced to staff on Monday, comes after Revolut boosted its annual profits by more than 150% in 2024 to £1bn, following a jump in subscriptions and revenues from its wealth and crypto trading divisions.</p> <p>Revolut’s founder and chief executive, Nik Storonsky, has already enjoyed a $200m-$300m windfall, according to reports, as a result of a separate share sale that valued the company at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/16/fintech-firm-revolut-valued-employee-share-sale\">$45bn last summer</a>. Storonsky is said to be in line for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/23/revolut-ceo-bonus-value-nik-storonsky\">multibillion-dollar fortune</a> if he manages to push the fintech company’s valuation past $150bn (£110bn).</p> <p>A Revolut spokesperson said on Monday:<strong> </strong>“As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity. An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won’t be commenting further until it is complete.”</p> <p>The announcement will be a boon for longstanding staff but the timing has sparked speculation that Revolut’s much-anticipated stock market debut may be further delayed.</p> <p>“This could be a sign that the company will either IPO soon or that its employees are getting antsy about the lack of an IPO and want to release their equity in the firm rather than wait for the IPO,” said Kathleen Brooks, a research director at the online broker XTB. “Whatever this moves signals, it is deep shame that Revolut is not planning to IPO in the UK.”</p> <p>Storonsky suggested last December that New York could be a better fit for the company’s IPO because of the regulatory environment and the size of the market. A US listing would be a major blow to the City and the London Stock Exchange, which has suffered from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/05/stock-exchange-dealt-another-blow-as-12bn-fintech-ditches-main-london-listing\">growing number of defections</a>.</p> <p>Revolut bosses have grown frustrated with UK regulators, who have been slow to grant the fintech a full banking licence that would allow it to hold customer deposits and branch out into more lucrative products such as loans and mortgages.</p> <p>The challenge, in part, was convincing regulators that Revolut had addressed accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/20/revolut-can-the-chancellors-fintech-favourite-fix-its-image-problem\">reputational concerns</a>, including an aggressive corporate culture. The fintech company says it has since resolved those accounting and regulatory problems and has made efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/16/fintech-revolut-psychologists-criticism-corporate-culture-uk-banking-licence\">improve its working culture</a>.</p> <p>The fintech waited three years for initial approval, which was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=revolut+gets+full+license+guardian&amp;oq=revolut+gets+full+license+guardian&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRiPAjIHCAUQIRiPAtIBCDY3NDVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">finally granted in July 2024</a>, and it has remained on a restricted UK banking licence since.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, tried to secure a meeting with watchdogs and regulators earlier this year amid the delay, but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/30/bank-of-england-governor-blocks-rachel-reeves-revolut-meeting\">blocked by the Bank of England governor</a>, Andrew Bailey, amid concerns that Reeves was meddling in a process that should be independent from government intervention and influence. </p>",

What a load of rubbish. Far better to order a free glass of tap water. At an Open University summer school some years ago, students were invited to take part in a trial. All were given 10 lots of two samples, Nottingham tap water and Highland Spring. There were enough participants over the weeks for a statistical sample. Answer? They could not tell the difference. Incidentally, licensed premises are obliged to provide free tap water on request. Refusing to do would be a breach of their licence condition.<br><strong>Rosalind Clayton</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Perhaps Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon, the owners of La Popote restaurant, could consider putting tap water on the menu as “Corporation Pop”, as we called it when I was a child in Manchester. If you wanted it fizzy, just shake it. The omission of Buxton water from&nbsp;their list is a crime.<br><strong>Chris Walters</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>• As a non-drinker, I can readily tell between my Vichy Catalan (my favourite) and my Badoit green bottle or Badoit red bottle (second favourite), all naturally carbonated. Would I pay £19 for a bottle of water I haven’t yet tried? 100%. What’s the difference between this and a fermented grape or a distilled grain? Those who don’t drink alcohol need more of this. Water is not simply just water. And what’s more, it’s good for you.<br><strong>Siân Miller</strong><br><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p> <p>• Simon Usborne enjoys a water menu at a Cheshire restaurant, but sampling craft water is nothing new. In 1874, Karl Marx was in Karlsbad – still known for its artisan waters – to imbibe spring waters for health reasons. Marx, who liked a pilsner beer, was rather grumpy about it, writing to Engels on 18&nbsp;September 1874 that drinking the water made him irritable.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>Tottenham, London</em></p> <p>• Betteridge’s law of headlines states that if it ends with a question mark, the answer is almost always “no”.

I too believe creative imagination is a muscle, which needs its exercise. She is also right that it can revolutionise scientific endeavour. My field of weather forecasting will soon be revolutionised by machine learning – a type of AI – where we recognise enough past weather patterns so that we can predict what weather will be coming. But writing best-man speeches, leaving speeches for work colleagues, letters to a dear friend? Do we really want to dissolve into brain-lazy folk who use AI to be the understudy to our own emotions?</p> <p>If I say “I love you” to someone, would they like to hear it from me or a bot? There is also another concern: AI output has no audit trail, no clues to its source. Its source is the wild west. Anyone – good, bad, indifferent – can feed into it, program it, bias it. If, as you say Imogen, you do end up in the woods in an “analogue manner” with your ability to think intact, I’ll happily join you. Hopefully others will too.<br><strong>Murray Dale</strong><br><em>Hayle, Cornwall</em></p> <p>• Imogen West-Knights shares her hatred of offloading to ChatGPT the tasks that make us human. And while I share her concerns (I couldn’t have put them better myself), there is an additional one that troubles me: if students go through their entire school lives with this all-knowing and all-solving technology at their fingertips, how will their critical thinking skills develop?</p> <p>Students in literature class are not given books such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/10/great-gatsby-f-scott-fitzgerald-today\">The Great Gatsby</a> so they can regurgitate the plot 20 years later at a dinner, but rather so that they can understand the interconnection of class disparities, wealth and the social atmosphere after the first world war, and so they can trace parallels with the present day.</p> <p>They learn multivariable calculus not because they will need it to buy groceries but to make their brains strong and malleable, so that grasping and implementing new concepts and ideas will become easier, whatever the subject.</p> <p>And they don’t learn history so they can repeat over and over “Victoria 1837, Edward VII 1901, George V 1910, Edward VIII 1936, George VI 1936, Elizabeth II 1952”, but to understand how sequences of events have led to wars, legislative changes and economic crises, and can do so again.</p> <p>Technologies that make work easier have always been seductive, and always will be. AI usage is already rampant in secondary schools and universities.</p> <p>But as ChatGPT turns three years old in a few months, preschoolers are also starting to go to kindergartens.

    "content": "<p>Martin Kettle accurately highlights the moral dilemma faced by the Royal Opera House in hiring the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko for the upcoming performances of Tosca (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/28/anna-netrebko-royal-opera-house-ukraine-russia-putin\">As Putin’s bombs fall on Ukraine, the Royal Opera House had a call to make about Anna Netrebko. It made the wrong one, 28 August</a>). He goes on to place the ball in Netrebko’s court by suggesting she should withdraw from the performances or “say something unambiguous for the British audience in opposition to Putin’s continuing war”. He later acknowledges that Netrebko stated her opposition to the war at its outset and that she was attacked for her stance by the Russian regime.</p> <p>Must this happen again? As Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova pointed out, when speaking in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/08/pussy-riot-nadya-tolokonnikova-interview-putin-nfts-russian\">2022 Guardian interview</a> of how she was “pretty much ready to die” when she went on hunger strike: “If you fight with a dictator, you have to show them that you are ready to fight to the end.” Members of Pussy&nbsp;Riot were separated from their children and endured appalling conditions in prison.</p> <p>We cannot expect such bravery from every artist – Netrebko should not have to be an activist as well as a world-class singer. It is really up to the Royal Ballet and Opera to decide how far to go with political alignment. They certainly need to address the discrepancy between their obvious support for Ukraine in the last three years and the recent suppression of a show of support for Palestine during a performance.<br><strong>Kate Lough</strong><br><em>Southsea, Hampshire</em></p> <p>• There is an incredible double standard with regard to the banning of Russian artists and sportspeople. Israel is waging a genocidal war in Gaza (not justified by the horrific atrocity against Israelis that preceded it), and its violent settlers have been systematically driving out the original dwellers of the West Bank for years now. However, not only are Israeli artists not banned, but Israel participates in European events despite not being in Europe, such as European football and the Eurovision song contest. </p> <p>Many other countries have carried out unprovoked attacks on other nations – for example, the US on Iraq in 2003 and Iran this year. Nobody has ever suggested that their artists be banned. </p> <p>Whether or not Anna Netrebko is close to Vladimir Putin, I do not see that ostracising her and other Russian artists is justified, unless artists from other countries engaging in wars of aggression are also banned, and unless all commercial contacts with Russia are also forbidden. Let us have the same standard for all.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong><br></p> <p>• I am surprised that Martin Kettle puts the onus completely on the management of the Royal Opera House. It has to make its way financially. If enough people buy tickets to watch and listen to Anna Netrebko, they will put her on stage. If the public choose not to watch her, her feet will not be seen for dust. The onus is clearly on opera-goers to boycott her performance, but perhaps they&nbsp;have feet of clay.<br><strong>Richard McLachlan</strong><br><em>Ipswich, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Would your writer like to give his&nbsp;opinion on the wartime National Gallery concerts of Dame&nbsp;Myra Hess and performances by others such as Eileen Joyce where they played music by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and other German composers? I used to believe that the arts reached out to solve problems, like Ukraine, where diplomacy clearly is failing.<br><strong>Trevor Singleton</strong><br><em>Warton, Lancashire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

a 10-point plan to prepare the country for the climate emergency</strong>, warning that <strong>“if we don’t want to bequeath our children a Spain that’s grey from fire and flames</strong>, or a Spain that’s brown from floods, <strong>then we need a Spain that’s greener”.</strong></p> <p>Sánchez said <strong>August’s heatwave-fuelled wildfires</strong> – which killed four people, burned through an area six times the size of Ibiza, and <strong>required “the biggest human and technical deployment” ever seen in Spain</strong> – showed immediate action must be taken to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>He said waiting any longer would be dangerous and expensive, and <strong>criticised those who deny the realities of global heating in Spain.</strong> </p> <p>Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused <strong>more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse €32bn (£28bn) in material losses.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>We need to mobilise as a society against climate change,</strong> which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“<strong>Climate change kills.</strong> It kills. </em></p> <p><em>And that’s why we have to be aware of everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it poses to our lives. The climate change denial that’s coming from an important part [of society] – and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on social networks by some members of our political class – is as incomprehensible as it is worrying.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He proposed a series of initiatives in Madrid on Monday, including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a network of climate refuges across the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/16/pauls-spain-wildfires-climate-change\">a rethink of forest management and land use</a>.

travelling to Plovdiv on Sunday when <strong>her charter plane lost electronic navigation aids</strong>, delaying its arrival in the central Bulgarian city.</p> <p><strong>Interference with satellite navigation has become increasingly common in airspace near Russia</strong> and it remains unclear whether von der Leyen was deliberately targeted. Asked about this point, EU spokesperson said: “The question is best asked to the Russians.”</p> <p><strong>The incident happened during a four-day trip by von der Leyen to seven EU member states on the bloc’s eastern border.</strong> In Vilnius on Monday, von der Leyen did not mention the incident, but spoke of “constant military and hybrid threats” facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania\">Lithuania</a>.</p> <p>In March 2024, <strong>Russia was believed to have been responsible for jamming the signal of a plane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/14/russia-suspected-of-jamming-gps-signal-on-aircraft-carrying-grant-shapps\">carrying the then UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps</a>,</strong> who was returning to the UK from Poland. The RAF plane experienced GPS interference for about 30 minutes while it flew near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. It was reported at the time that it was unclear whether Shapps was the target.</p> <p><strong>GPS jamming and “spoofing”</strong> – an electronic warfare tactic that causes incorrect navigation information to be displayed – <strong>has increased since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022</strong>, and escalated even more sharply in the last year.</p> <p>In June, <strong>13 EU member states raised the alarm about jamming and spoofing threats disrupting air and sea travel.</strong> Poland recorded 2,732 cases of electronic interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in October 2023, while Lithuania recorded 1,185, up from 556 in March 2024, according to an <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9198-2025-INIT/en/pdf\">internal EU document</a> drafted in May.</p> <p>The document describes <strong>interference to global satellite navigation systems as “not random incidents but a systemic, deliberate action by Russia and Belarus”.</strong> It added that “causing significant damage has been simple and cheap” and was likely to continue without “proportional countermeasures”.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68b592378f08e8bac272661a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-01T12:34:02.261Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Council president <strong>António Costa </strong>argued that the EU could not risk escalating tensions with the US over trade and tariffs at the same time as the bloc’s eastern borders remained under threat from Russia.</p> <p>Speaking at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, he said it would be have been an imprudent risk to risk the relationship with the US.</p> <p>That is why ... we chose diplomacy over escalation.

    "description": "<p>Objects including three-metre spears were collected in late 19th and early 20th centuries and donated to city’s museum</p>",
    "content": "<p>For decades, they have languished in storage in the basement of a museum in the English West Country. Finally, an extraordinary collection of weapons and ceremonial objects taken from the Larrakia people more than a century ago is beginning a winding journey home to the saltwater landscapes of the Northern Territory in Australia.</p> <p>During an emotionally charged ceremony, Bristol city council formally handed over 33 objects including spears that would have been used to hunt creatures from fish to buffalo, some still gleaming with the red ochre used to decorate them.</p> <p>They will be flown to Melbourne and then taken by truck to Garramilla/Darwin – road is the only option because at three metres some of the spears are too long to be transported on a domestic flight – and the plan is to show them at the <a href=\"https://www.larrakiaculturalcentre.com.au/\">Larrakia cultural centre</a>, which is scheduled to open on a site overlooking Darwin harbour next year.</p> <p>“It’s a good day, very important,” said Nigel Browne, a Larrakia and Wulna man who was in Bristol to receive the objects. “This is the end of a four-year journey. To see the return of these cultural objects that were taken from Larrakia is very significant. They are the tools of our trade as ancient huntsmen, fishermen. They have been gone a long time.</p> <p>“They’ll be used not only to admire back home, but also teach a new generation of Larrakia how to craft spears that our ancestors were very adept at making. It’s not just about the past here. It’s about the future, teaching the next generation about their heritage.”</p> <p>Browne said museums across Australia and around the world held hundreds of such objects: “That’s the same for many different groups, not just Larrakia. Objects were taken over many years.”</p>    <p>He said other institutions should look at what Bristol had done: “It puts them in a leading role internationally and can be used as an example as to what good can happen.”</p> <p>Some of the objects could be photographed while others were kept hidden beneath tissue paper. Browne said: “Some of the objects we call secret and sacred and were used for ceremony.” The ones from Bristol can only be handled by men.</p> <p>The objects were collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and donated to the museum. The earliest is a collection of spears, a spear thrower and a club donated by a Mr R Cuff in 1881. Nothing more is known of him. Marlborough College in Wiltshire donated five spears in 1934.</p> <p>Five years later, spears and spear throwers were donated by a relative of an English botanist who had “acquired” them while working in Darwin. Some were put on display in Bristol for a while, but all have been in storage for at least half a century.</p> <p>Mikayla Lee, a Larrakia woman and a member of the advisory group for the Larrakia cultural centre, described the recovery of the objects as overwhelming. “It’s very moving, emotional, a special moment,” she said.</p> <p>The handover took place in the museum’s Wills Hall, named after the <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/anti-racism-at-bristol/university-slavery/wills-family/\">family</a> who made a fortune out of tobacco and whose financial success benefited from slavery. Close by were artefacts taken from Nigeria and China, and the council said it would continue to work on repatriations of objects taken by British colonialists.</p> <p>The leader of the council, Tony Dyer, said he was proud of the work that had been done with the Larrakia people and that other objects may be repatriated to other countries. “I think there is much for us to learn from this and much to share with others,” he said.</p> <p>Some Larrakia people who could not make it to Bristol had sent moving reactions to images they had been shown of the pieces.</p> <p>“That’s a fishing spear.

    "description": "<p>Experts ‘extremely concerned’ about e-cigarette use and say millions of young people could face ill health in future</p>",
    "content": "<p>Doctors have raised the alarm about high levels of vaping among children worldwide, saying they are convinced e-cigarettes are causing irreversible harm to their health.</p> <p>Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.</p> <p>Nicotine levels in e-cigarettes can be very high, raising the risk of addiction and injury to the developing brains of adolescents. Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.</p> <p>Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.</p> <p>She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”</p> <p>Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.</p> <p>Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).</p> <p>When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.</p> <p>The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.</p> <p>“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”</p> <p>When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.</p> <p>“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”</p> <p>Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.</p> <p>“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”</p> <p>Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”</p> <p>Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes. </p> <p>“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Yvette Cooper could face legal action over the decision to keep an asylum seeker with schizophrenia in prison.</p> <p>The high court has ordered the home secretary to release the 25-year-old man by 8 September, and the Home Office may have to pay him damages for breaching his human rights.</p> <p>The judgment, published this week within hours of Nigel Farage unveiling plans for “mass deportations”, demonstrates the legal obstacles a Reform UK administration might face.</p> <p>The claimant, from Nigeria, whose name was anonymised in the judgment, was jailed for offences in Scotland in October 2024 and was due to be released in January this year.</p> <p>However, weeks before he was to be released, the man signed a letter withdrawing his asylum claim. The home secretary then detained him in prison under immigration powers to remove him from the country and prevent him absconding in the meantime.</p> <p>After lawyers told the home secretary that the man did not understand what he was signing and did not want to withdraw his asylum application, Cooper reinstated his asylum claim.</p> <p>However, the high court heard, she “continued to detain” him, believing he could be removed from the country within weeks.</p> <p>In the judgment, the deputy high court judge Alan Bates said he was not satisfied it was reasonable for the home secretary to believe the claimant’s case would be dealt with quickly, given “the combination of the reinstated asylum claim and the accumulating indicators of the claimant’s psychosis”.</p> <p>In May a tribunal granted immigration bail to the claimant, which should have led to his release. Nonetheless, he remained in prison, more than 15 weeks on, because he had not been provided with “a suitable accommodation address in the community”, Judge Bates said.</p> <p>Concerning the claimant’s detention since he was granted bail, Bates said it was “arguable” that the home secretary “has not always acted with the appropriate diligence and … that this has led to the claimant remaining in detention for a longer time than necessary”.</p> <p>Bates, granting an interim order for the claimant’s release and permission to apply for a judicial review, which would determine whether his detention was unlawful, said it was “arguable that [Cooper’s] detention of the claimant … has, at least at times, been incompatible” with his right to liberty under article 5 of the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Bates warned that a case for damages for unlawful detention could follow against the Home Office, adding: “Damages would not be an adequate remedy … especially so in the circumstances of this case, given that there is some evidence that detention may be worsening … [his] mental health.”</p> <p>Between July 2021 and April 2024 the claimant, believed to have entered the UK in a lorry at Dover, was under the care of mental health services and twice detained under the Mental Health Act.</p> <p>He was jailed in October 2024 for 18 months after travelling from asylum accommodation in Wolverhampton to Pitlochry, Scotland, where he threatened a shopkeeper with a broken bottle in an argument. His previous convictions included possessing a knife and assaulting an emergency worker.</p> <p>After his sentence in Scotland, he was detained at Brook House immigration removal centre in West Sussex, where concerns were raised that he might be a victim of torture and that detention would worsen his mental health.</p> <p>But in April of this year he was moved to HMP Lewes in East Sussex, apparently because his “erratic” behaviour could not be “adequately managed” at an immigration removal centre.</p> <p>Bates, in his judgment, said “in fairness” to the home secretary, the making of “appropriate arrangements” for the claimant’s release – considering his mental health, licence conditions and the immigration regime – were “not without practical complexities”.</p> <p>He added: “I bear in mind that [Cooper] accepts that the claimant must be released. What is preventing his release is the non-availability to him of suitable accommodation, which has been approved as suitable by his [social worker].”</p> <p>A further hearing concerning potential proceedings for damages for unlawful detention is expected to take place in October. The Home Office has been approached for comment.</p>",

I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.”</p> <p>Harri added: “She was self-possessed enough when they arrived at Paddington to jump off the train, find a guy in uniform and say, ‘That man just attacked me,’ and he was arrested.”</p> <p>The queen, 78, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/camilla-and-may-back-nhs-campaign-to-help-victims-and-survivors-of-abuse\">has long campaigned against domestic violence and sexual abuse</a>, and has dedicated her royal charity work to supporting victims of sexual assault.</p> <p>A number of years ago she championed the idea of washbags for people who have been attacked, an idea that has recently been revived.</p> <p><em>• Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

    "content": "<p>A police officer was allegedly punched in the face and four people were arrested at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said they had been facilitating a peaceful demonstration along Manchester Road and Westferry Road on the Isle of Dogs before “a small number of masked protesters then became aggressive towards members of the public and police”.</p> <p>The group had reportedly moved into Canary Wharf shopping centre at about 4.30pm.</p> <p>A section 60 AA order was issued to “prevent people concealing their identity with masks”, as well as a section 35 dispersal order which directed protesters to leave.</p> <p>Both orders last until midnight, police said on Sunday evening.</p> <p>The Met said: “Arrests were made for common assault by a protester on a member of the public, possession of class A and B drugs, assault on police/public order offences and failure to disperse.</p> <p>“One of our officers was punched in the face – luckily they did not suffer significant injury.”</p> <p>The protest, involving between 50 and 100 people, began outside the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf on Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>Some anti-immigration demonstrators were seen carrying union flags and placards.</p>    <p>About 100 counter-protesters held banners bearing slogans including “stand up to racism” and “stop the far right”. The group also chanted: “Say it loud and say it clear, refugees are welcome here.”</p> <p>Commander Adam Slonecki, in charge of policing London this weekend, said: “This afternoon we have unfortunately seen more disorder, following the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/30/five-arrested-after-masked-men-try-to-enter-west-london-asylum-hotel\"> five arrests made yesterday in the West Drayton area</a>.</p> <p>“Today’s protest saw many community members attend, including women and children, and we worked to ensure the safety of those there to peacefully represent their views.</p> <p>“Those who arrive at protests masked and intent on causing trouble will continue to be dealt with robustly at future protests.”</p> <p>He added: “We remain in the area to deter any further disorder and provide reassurance to local residents and businesses.”</p> <p>Elsewhere on Sunday, three people were arrested after hundreds of protesters gathered again outside the Bell hotel in Epping calling for the removal of asylum seekers housed there.</p> <p>Essex police said a woman was arrested on suspicion of breaching a section 14 order, requiring demonstrators to stay in a prescribed area during the protest.</p> <p>A man was also arrested “on suspicion of inciting racial hatred after an emblem was reported to have been set alight” on Friday, while another was arrested for breaching the section 14 order in place after reportedly refusing to leave when the assembly on Sunday had ended.</p> <p>Police added that all three remained in custody on Sunday evening.</p> <p>Several protesters were seen waving union and St George’s cross flags during Sunday’s protest.</p> <p>“Send them home, please protect me,” read a T-shirt worn by one young girl, while a boy held up a sign saying “deport foreign criminals”.</p> <p>Police put in place a dispersal order “to prevent and deal with any antisocial behaviour”, and a section 60 AA order, both of which remained in place on Sunday evening.</p> <p>The Bell hotel became a focal point for protests in July after an asylum seeker staying there was accused of sexually assaulting two 14-year-old girls. He has denied the allegation, telling a court on Wednesday that he did not touch the girls.</p> <p>The latest protests come two days after an appeal court overturned a temporary injunction that had blocked the use of the hotel to house asylum seekers.</p> <p>Stuart Hooper, assistant chief constable with Essex police, said: “We’ve consistently said that we will always seek to facilitate lawful protest but that does not include a right to commit crime, and we’ll take a firm approach to anyone intent on doing that.</p> <p>“And, to reiterate to the public, the strength of feeling in Epping is not lost on me – or anyone in Essex police – and I would urge anyone who wants to make their voices heard to please do that peacefully and within the parameters outlined.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>One reader has been subjected to racist abuse, another says there is nothing wrong in expressing affection for one’s country. Plus letters fom <strong>Jane Ryan</strong>, <strong>Michael Pyke</strong> and <strong>Hugh Coolican</strong></p>",
    "content": "<p>Last week in my small rural town, St George’s flags were erected from lamp-posts and crudely daubed on roundabouts and zebra crossings, while residents were subjected to “<em>Sieg Heil</em>” as a mob walked along the streets. Downing Street has put out a statement that patriotism is important, while Joanne Monk, the Reform UK leader of Worcestershire city council, also emphasised pride in the flag.</p> <p>I have nothing against the flag per se, but when Nazi thugs use it to demonstrate and catcall, it morphs into something else entirely. As a Black person, I have been subject to abuse three times in the past fortnight. My 12-year-old child and his friend were called “paedos” at school – they are the only Black children in the class – and a friend’s child was called the N-word on the bus (this was before the summer recess). To be Black in the countryside at the moment is to have a target on your back.</p> <p>There are real-world consequences of constantly demonising Black and Brown people in the media, racialising crimes and acting as if the most vulnerable people in our society – asylum seekers – are the reasons your energy bills are too high or you can’t afford your food shop.</p> <p>Nigel Farage and his acolytes know what they are doing with their disinformation and division&nbsp;campaign, and the media should be ashamed of giving them so much airtime. As Rafael Behr notes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/27/nigel-farage-keir-starmer-brexit-truth\">There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August</a>), the distraction technique is a well-worn part of Farage’s playbook. A strong prime minister would call him out, not mimic him. If he gets into Downing Street in 2029, as some pollsters predict, we will only have&nbsp;ourselves to blame.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• I am surprised that someone who asked their neighbour to take down an England flag is astonished by their refusal to do so (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/26/the-truth-about-flying-the-flag-of-saint-george\">Letters, 26 August</a>). But why would they comply? The flag is not obscene, offensive or inappropriate; it is the flag of England being flown in England.</p> <p>I do not recall similar objections when Ukrainian flags appeared in windows in a display of solidarity. Nor do such debates arise when the England men’s football team enjoys success, prompting a surge of flags in cars, pubs and homes. And the union jacks along the Mall in London rarely attract controversy.</p> <p>To equate the St George’s cross with extremism is a mistake. Suppressing its display does not challenge intolerance, it merely silences legitimate expressions of national identity. Surely the more constructive approach is to foster open discussion rather than to remove symbols.</p> <p>If one chooses to live in England, one should reasonably expect to see England’s flag flown with pride. There is nothing inherently wrong&nbsp;in expressing affection&nbsp;for&nbsp;one’s own country.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• I live on a terrace of 16 houses. A couple of years ago, one of our neighbours put up a St George’s cross. At first, the flag seemed football-related, but they left it flying indefinitely. As such a powerful signifier of patriotism, many of us felt it gave our terrace a&nbsp;distorted and unwanted image.</p> <p>It then occurred to us that we could drown out that cultural noise by us all flying flags. Ten houses participated. We made poles from fishing rods and bamboo. I chose the flag of Jamaica to represent my partly Caribbean family. There were flags from the Philippines, Scotland, Spain, rainbows and doves, and we raised them as high&nbsp;as possible above the union flag. On breezy, sunny days they made our terrace seem like a festival of difference.</p> <p>Many people asked residents what we were celebrating. Our answer was that “we are from everywhere”. The St George’s cross couple soon left and our community settled back into its peaceful ways.<br><strong>Jane Ryan</strong><br><em>Woodbridge, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Further to the very interesting letters about the current rash of flags, has anyone noticed that nearly all the ones on tall lamp-posts are flying at half mast? Is it just that flag-flyers don’t have cherry pickers, or are we unconsciously in mourning for the decline of compassion and decency?<br><strong>Michael Pyke</strong><br><em>Lichfield, Staffordshire</em></p> <p>• It’s heartening to see so many lads supporting the England women’s team in the Rugby World Cup with their street flags.<br><strong>Hugh Coolican</strong><br><em>Broughton Astley, Leicestershire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/31/why-zero-hours-workers-welcome-labour-rights-bill",
    "description": "<p>Critics of the legislation want the government to water it down, but for many employees change can’t come too soon</p>",
    "content": "<p>When Seamus Foley took a job on a zero-hours contract at a board games bar in London two years ago, the flexibility it offered was appealing. Now, the deal looks so bad he is prepared to walk out on strike.</p> <p>“It’s exhausting. You’re constantly living your life on the back foot,” says the employee at <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/en/news/2025/08/draughts-workers-shut-down-stratford-and-waterloo-bars-with-strike-action/\">Draughts</a>, which has bars in Stratford and Waterloo. There, workers fed up with last-minute rota changes and a lack of basic protections are staging industrial action.</p> <p>“It feels like all the power is in the hands of the employer,” he says, adding that he feels as though these kinds of contracts are “designed to keep you desperate, hungry and uncertain as to what your next week or two weeks look like.”</p> <p>Almost 1.2 million workers in the UK are on zero-hours contracts. Despite the preparations being made by Keir Starmer’s government to ban the use of exploitative arrangements, a key manifesto promise, the zero-hours ranks have swelled since Labour’s election victory, rising by <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/emp17peopleinemploymentonzerohourscontracts\">more than 100,000</a> to close to a record high.</p> <p>Big employers with hundreds of thousands of zero-hours staff between them include McDonald’s, Burger King, Dominos and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, and the contracts are still routinely used in social care, hospitality and logistics.</p> <p>Workers’ rights have been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/25/cbi-chair-accuses-labour-government-of-treating-employers-as-a-cash-cow\">long-running battle</a> between the government and employers – a row that will intensify this autumn once MPs return from their summer break amid fierce lobbying to water down Labour’s employment rights legislation.</p> <p>A flashpoint will come in a showdown between ministers and Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/28/zero-hours-contracts-peers-accused-of-trying-to-block-stronger-uk-workers-rights\">the Lords imposed amendments</a> in the final days before the summer recess to drastically curtail the bill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/GwOx7/2/\" data-alt=\"People on zero-hours contract graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/GwOx7/2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Justin Madders, the employment minister, said Labour would face down the critics. “We have got a democratic mandate to introduce this bill and the measures. Our starting point is we would continue with it. We’ll see where we end up [with the Lords], but I don’t think at the moment we’ll be looking to resile from things that were clearly in our manifesto.”</p> <p>Business groups say the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/uk-retailers-rachel-reeves-budget-tax-rises-brc\">cost of hiring staff has soared</a> under Labour after the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and rise in the “national living wage” were introduced from April.</p> <p>Firms say too many changes are being made at once when Britain’s economy is weak and the jobs market cooling. Unemployment has risen, partly due to Reeves’s tax rises. Businesses say adding to their costs further would drive joblessness higher, highlighting a £5bn price tag for the workers’ rights policy in the government’s own impact assessment.</p>    <p>Jane Gratton, the deputy director for public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says: “You’ll have seen from the figures that the labour market is loosening. If you make it more difficult and costly to employ people, it’s likely to impact on opportunities for people. It will drive business behaviour. We know the government’s own assessment is £5bn. We think that’s probably an underestimate.”</p> <p>A Federation of Small Businesses survey found 67% of small firms would recruit fewer staff as a result of the bill. </p> <p>“These measures will just tie businesses in knots and will have real negative impacts on workers too, such as stopping people swapping shifts. It shows what goes wrong when there is such an out-of-touch approach to policymaking,” said Tina McKenzie, the lobby group’s policy chair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Cnc9i/1/\" data-alt=\"Hospitality graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Cnc9i/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Some lobbyists believe Labour is more likely to cede ground on workers’ rights than on tax and spending before a tough autumn budget. Unlike a costly and embarrassing U-turn on employer NICs, any changes would be fiscally neutral, and it would sit well with Reeves’s wider deregulatory agenda.</p> <p>However, party insiders say this would underestimate Reeves’ and Starmer’s commitment to stronger workers’ rights. Both are also under pressure to stick to the policy after disappointing many core Labour voters since coming to power.</p> <p>The bill’s chief proponent, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, said the government wanted to work closely with businesses to make the details of the bill work, including a consultation on the zero-hours ban this autumn, but that changes were vital after years of workplace exploitation.</p> <p>“Zero-hours contracts are leaving far too many people without the security they deserve – working hard but left waiting for shifts, unsure what their pay will be month to month. We are tackling this head-on,” she said.</p> <p>Under Labour’s planned changes, zero-hours workers will get the right to a guaranteed-hours contract reflecting their hours over a 12-week reference period. This comes alongside other measures including day-one protections against unfair dismissal and rolling back trade union restrictions.</p> <p>To overcome business concerns over the breadth of the policy changes, the government has planned to introduce each step gradually, with the ban on zero-hours contracts coming last in late 2027.</p>    <p>However, critics on Labour’s left say this is glacial change and warn that allowing continued use of zero-hours contracts does not constitute a ban and leaves too much power in the hands of bad bosses.</p> <p>Madders said Labour had sought to strike a balance that recognised how some workers appreciate the flexibility of zero hours, while tipping the balance to stop bad employers forcing staff to stay on those terms against their will.</p> <p>“What we have done is find a pretty sweet spot where, actually, people who want some certainty and security at work will be able to have that. The bill is done in a way that can make sure that people who do not want to be on a zero-hours contract will not be forced,” he said.</p> <p>Official figures show 60% of zero-hours workers do not want more hours. About a quarter are in full-time education and more than half are under the age of 35. Those on the contracts work about 19 hours a week on average, compared with 32 hours for other workers. As many as 10% of zero-hours workers have been on such an arrangement with their employer for more than 10 years.</p> <p>Working conditions have long been an early casualty of straitened economic conditions in Britain. Zero-hours contracts first rose to prominence in the febrile climate after the 2008 financial crisis as employers sought a way to flexibly ramp up their labour capacity to meet slowly returning consumer demand, with the get-out clause that they could reduce staff hours to cut their costs if things turned south again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/zero-hoursfewerhours/giv-32554lTNq1x6MbfKn/\" data-alt=\"Hours graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/zero-hoursfewerhours/giv-32554lTNq1x6MbfKn/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Mike Ashley, the billionaire retail tycoon, and his Sports Direct chain became a target for public anger over its use of the contracts and its wider employment practices after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Guardian investigation</a> at its main warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.</p> <p>As the contracts became near synonymous with worker exploitation, some firms dropped them, including the pub chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/jd-wetherspoon-sports-direct-zero-hours-contracts\">JD Wetherspoon</a>. McDonald’s moved to allow workers to choose a guaranteed-hours contract. However, about 90% of McDonald’s 135,000 UK staff are still on zero-hours terms and the fast food chain has faced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65388445\">accusations of harassment and sexual assault</a> by managers. McDonald’s did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Unions say warnings over the hit to the jobs market resemble the same arguments used in the 1990s against Labour introducing the minimum wage, which were shown to be false. They highlight that strengthening workers’ rights is a vote winner, backed by most of the electorate, and that more job security is key to boosting workforce productivity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/zero-hoursyoungadultsandwomen/giv-32554vxOrkuSauZmm/\" data-alt=\"Young adults contracts graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/zero-hoursyoungadultsandwomen/giv-32554vxOrkuSauZmm/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Tim Sharp, the head of employment rights at the TUC, says: “We’ve had this long experiment with zero hours and other forms of precarious contract for too long. There is no incentive for employers to train and develop their workers and we pay the economic price for that.”</p> <p>However, analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests the changes will have neither a massive negative impact nor a huge positive one. Even if the government’s £5bn cost to businesses transpires, it would equate to just 11,000 job losses.</p> <p>It said: “This is tiny – cutting the employment rate by just 0.02% – in the context of changes that will give millions of workers new protections at work.”</p> <p>For Foley and his striking co-workers on the picket line at Draughts, efforts to negotiate guaranteed-hours contracts have so far run into a dead end. “Thus far it seems to be something they’re not willing to entertain,” he says.</p> <p>Represented by the United Voices of the World union, it is the first time the bar worker has been involved in industrial action. He says Draughts’ managers had sought to reassure staff they would be treated fairly regardless of their contracts, but this amounted to very little. “You can’t take a verbal agreement. Ultimately, if we don’t have something written into our contracts, we can’t enforce upon it when it’s breached.”</p> <p>He added: “I don’t feel like they’ve given us any sort of solid response that isn’t a platitude.” Draughts did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Despite fearing employers could still “game the system” under Labour’s proposals, Foley said the changes could still be very attractive. “It would definitely be better than what we have now,” he says.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Every spring for decades my neighbour, Jan Moore, who has died aged 96, would fly 10,000 miles from her home in Brisbane, Australia, to the Ayrshire harbour village of Maidens. There she would spend the summer in a cottage overlooking the Clyde and the Isle of Arran.</p> <p>Her annual pilgrimage was down to her Scots blood; she was born and raised in Maidens, and vowed in the mid-1960s that she would return each year. Her cottage in the village was near mine, and that is how we came to know each other.</p> <p>Jan was born in Maidens to James Sloan, a fisherman, and Elizabeth (nee Howatson), a cheesemaker. The family home was only steps away from the property that she later returned to year after year.</p> <p>After attending Carrick academy in nearby Maybole, she trained as a teacher at the Moray House School of Education in Edinburgh and then worked in various Ayrshire schools, including Maidens primary, where she herself had been a pupil.</p> <p>At the age of 21 she travelled with her mother to Australia on a family trip, and in Adelaide they had been driven around by the only person they knew with a car – a young man named Alan Moore, an agronomy student. Three years later he suddenly showed up in Maidens. Romance blossomed, and an engagement was announced. When Alan left for the US for his doctoral studies, Jan followed, and they married in 1954, after which she concentrated on raising their family.</p> <p>In subsequent years Alan’s work as an agronomist took them to Canada, Nigeria, the Netherlands, India and Italy, countries in which Jan was able to indulge her curiosity about the world. She and Alan were especially fond of Italy, where they could indulge their mutual passion for zipping around in Alpha Romeo sports cars.</p> <p>In 1965 a new job for Alan took them to Australia, where they settled for good. It was about five years later that Jan began her annual pilgrimages back home. After Alan’s death in 2004, and well into her tenth decade, she continued to return every year. She was packing her bags ready for another trip earlier this year when ill health prevented her from going.</p> <p>She is survived by her four children, David, Nicholas, Fiona and Catriona, and five grandchildren. Her ashes were placed in the nearest cemetery to Maidens, in the village of Kirkoswald.</p>",
