Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”</p> \n  <p>He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”</p> \n  <p>The problem for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a></strong> is that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.</p> \n  <p>They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts\">winter fuel duty</a></strong> decision, the freebies row and the handling of <strong>welfare cuts</strong> – have instead unleashed more chaos.</p> \n  <p>The most recent example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">sacking of </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">Peter Mandelson</a></strong>. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.</p> \n  <p>Then, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.</p> \n  <p>With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.</p> \n  <p>Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the <strong>NHS</strong>, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.</p> \n  <p>“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions. We’re doing lots of good stuff but it barely gets noticed. It just doesn’t hit the mark.”</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">Can Keir survive?

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> \n  <p>Blake said last week’s reshuffle saw a “narrowing” of representation of different parts of the party in ministerial positions:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People just felt that it was such a large reshuffle and, you know, people who were actually delivering in their posts were moved. And it just kind of felt like there was a real narrowing in who was sat around the table, and that can’t be positive, because I think there’s a sense that the leadership don’t like to be challenged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the No 10 operation, she said it was “really embarrassing” if Starmer was not told about Lord Mandelson’s emails to <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> soon enough, amid suggestions <strong>Downing Street</strong> was aware of the messages before the prime minister defended the ex-ambassador on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Blake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the back benches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> \n   <p>Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also said backbenchers are frustrated after a number of “own goals” for the government. Blake, the MP for <strong>Sheffield Hallam</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it is “frustrating” that the good work the government has done is “not cutting through” and added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Instead, we’ve had a number of kind of own goals, and that has meant that we’ve slipped heavily in the polls, and that we seem to be more interested in focusing on each other rather than what’s in the best interest of the country at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are some other key developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</strong>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Senior Labour MPs and the UK’s largest anti-fascist campaign group have called on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> to mount a more heartfelt defence of diversity and anti-racism.</strong> They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lucy Powell has called for a “change of culture” inside Starmer’s Downing Street to make it more inclusive and better connected to MPs</strong>, promising that as Labour’s deputy leader she would when needed deliver difficult truths to the prime minister. Speaking to the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/phillipson-and-powell-confirmed-as-final-contenders-in-labour-deputy-race\">after she secured</a> 117 MP nominations in the battle to replace Angela Rayner, Powell said a sequence of what she called “unforced errors” by the government had left many Labour MPs and members frustrated.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The bill to legalise assisted dying is a “licence to kill” that puts vulnerable people at risk, Theresa May has said</strong>, as the legislation was <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/sept-2025/assisted-dying-bill-considered-by-lords/\">debated in the House of Lords</a> for the first time. The former prime minister said she opposed the bill because she said people in England and Wales with disabilities, chronic illnesses or mental health conditions could feel under pressure to end their lives, and “because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others”.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:27:54.210Z\">at 9.27am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c549378f0880bae9c52d8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:40:54.635Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ebere Eze</strong> makes his full Arsenal debut, replacing Gabriel Martinelli in one of three changes from the defeat at Arsenal. <strong>Martin Odegaard</strong> comes in for Declan Rice, who is rested, and <strong>Cristhian Mosquera</strong> covers for the injured William Saliba.</p> <p>Ange Postecoglou makes only one enforced change to the last Nottingham Forest XI selected by Nuno Espirito Santo. <strong>Morato</strong> comes in for the injured Ola Aina, which probably means a switch to right-back for Neco Williams.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-3-3)</strong> Raya; Timber, Mosquera, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Merino; Madueke, Gyokeres, Eze.<br><em>Subs: Kepa, White, Lewis-Skelly, Hincapie, Rice, Nwaneri, Dowman, Martinelli, Trossard.</em></p> <p><strong>Nottm Forest (4-2-3-1)</strong> Sels; Williams, Milenkovic, Murillo, Morato; Sangare, Anderson; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood.<br><em>Subs: Victor, Luiz, Kalimuendo, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee, Bakwa, Boly, Savona.</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Darren England.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2a1838f08671965418dbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:30:02.208Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Narrative is oxygen in modern football coverage, and we’ll all be gulping plenty of the good stuff this afternoon.

What did they mean?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Investigators who found a bolt-action rifle near the site where Charlie Kirk was shot on a Utah campus said that they also found casings scrawled with messages.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, a 22-year-old college student was reported to have confessed to his family that he had shot and killed Kirk earlier this week. Robinson was arrested after his father recognised him in photos and video footage police released of the shooter escaping the scene.</p> \n  <p>One of the casings read, <strong>“hey fascist! CATCH! (up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols),”</strong>, according to an affadavit filed on Friday in a Utah court.</p> \n  <p>The arrows were most likely a reference to the popular video game Helldivers 2 and its sequence of controller moves to unleash a powerful bomb, according to an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">analysis </a>published by the New York Times.</p> \n  <p>Much of the other casings had similar messages steeped in video game references and allusions to different internet subcultures.</p> \n  <p>One of the messages, <strong>“Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,”</strong> is often used to mock participants in online role-play communities, namely furries. Another message said, <strong>“If you read This, you are GAY Lmao,”</strong> its tone suggestive of the kind of humour found on internet messaging boards.</p> \n  <p>Another casing read, <strong>“O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!,”</strong> likely a reference to the popular Italian folk song “Bella Ciao.” Popularised as an antifascist anthem in Italy after the second world war, it resurfaced globally in recent years because of its inclusion in the hit Netflix series “Money Heist” and in video games, including the first-person shooter game Far Cry 6.</p> \n  <p>The casing messages, like Robinson’s political ideology, are difficult to parse. The NYT has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">reported</a> that Robinson registered to vote in Utah, but is not affiliated with a political party and had never voted in an election, according to the Washington County Clerk.</p> \n  <p>His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c5627b8f084b3c85a4e1ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:25:26.026Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> on Friday “don’t even bother dealing with” the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare\">healthcare</a> priorities.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress\">Congress</a> is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives\">House of Representatives</a> have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.</p> \n  <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.</p> \n  <p>“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”</p> \n  <p>The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump\">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> Republicans passed in July.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c55d0f8f0880bae9c52e13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:16:46.019Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>What a swell party it was.

For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> \n  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-maga-influence\">Charlie Kirk and the rise of Maga in US politics: ‘He changed the ground game’</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c53fa38f0880bae9c52d44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:00:14.501Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: \"prowling Blacks\", \"some gun deaths\" worth it for second amendment right</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a>, the far-right commentator and ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, was killed on Wednesday doing what he was known for throughout his career – making incendiary and often racist and sexist comments to large audiences.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here’s Kirk, in his own words.

It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to “go” when you are. Just say when? </p> \n  <p>I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. </p> \n  <p>This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR.

    "content": "<p>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by Tommy Robinson to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p> \n<p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central London, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> \n<p>Other planned speakers on Saturday include Ant Middleton, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for Germany’s far-right AfD party and a far-right Polish MEP.</p> \n<p>Other Americans making the trip include Joey Mannarino, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump. </p> \n<p>However, there are doubts about whether one of the most high-profile speakers, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior Jordan Peterson, will appear.</p> \n<p>While he is listed in the lineup and has been a supporter of Robinson online, he has made no mention of the event recently. His appearance would also pose questions about his continued association with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists\">Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC)</a>, a yearly gathering in London involving businesses and conservatives that has included the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK.</p> \n<p>A pause on any new leave being booked has been imposed by police, who have had to contend with violence on the fringes of previous events involving Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.</p> \n<p>In a video to supporters on Thursday about the Kirk shooting, Robinson talked about “the bastard who has murdered him, or the organisation, the corporation or the government it is that has killed him”.</p> \n<p>A 22-year-old man, identified as Tyler Robinson by Spencer Cox, governor of Utah, was later arrested as a suspect in the fatal shooting.</p> \n<p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p> \n<p>The Stand Up to Racism march to a rally at Whitehall will be led by a Women Against the Far Right contingent including the MPs Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.</p> \n<p>“The far right are a menace to the whole of society. Their first targets, asylum seekers and Muslims, are broadening to all migrants, black people and on to trade unionists, all religious minorities and anti-racists,” said Abbott.</p> \n<p>Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: “This is going to be big, but we are also talking about movement to the right of Reform UK and we still don’t know where it is going.”</p> \n<p>Robinson also recently said he had joined Advance UK, a party set up by former senior figures in Reform UK, including Ben Habib, which will itself be formally launched next month.</p> \n<p>Robinson has increasingly pivoted towards an outwardly Christian nationalist position, particularly after his release from his latest prison sentence. Christian nationalists will be among the crowd, but a large section are expected to be drawn from the ranks of those who have taken part in the recent wave of protests outside asylum-seeker accommodation.</p> \n<p>As with other Robinson events, the core of support is also expected to come from a network of football fan and hooligan firms that are also involved in the English Defence League (EDL).</p> \n<p>Lowles posed the question: “What does this rally signify politically? One scenario is that people will coalesce around Tommy Robinson and Advance UK, but it will require him to step up.”</p> \n<p>“A lot of what he does is about himself and he’s been engaged in a huge amount of merchandising for this event, as well as constant appeals for money towards a goal of about £300,000. What will he do with it? Advance UK need him more than he needs them, but equally this could become part of his fight with Farage.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police has been engaged in discussions with Robinson before the event. The force does not give permission for protests but requires advance notice of a procession to allow for appropriate planning.</p> \n<p>A Met spokesperson said: “Saturday will be a busy day in London and officers will be on duty in significant numbers to keep people safe.”</p> \n<p>The force said Muslim Londoners should not change their plans in light of the rally.</p> \n<p>Commander Clair Haynes, who is in charge of the public order policing operation in London this weekend, said: “We recognise that there are particular concerns for many in London’s Muslim communities ahead of the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest given the record of anti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents of offensive chanting by a minority at previous marches.</p> \n<p>“There have been some suggestions that Muslim Londoners should change their behaviour this Saturday, including not coming into town. That is not our advice.</p> \n<p>“Everyone should be able to feel safe travelling into and around London.”</p> \n<p>As well as Robinson’s rally, which is styled as a “free speech festival” and will take place at the southern end of Whitehall after a march from Waterloo, the counter-protest by Stand Up to Racism will take place at the northern end of Whitehall, after a march from Russell Square.</p> \n<p>“There are a number of other events taking place on the same day, including multiple football fixtures, which will all form part of the policing operation,” the Met spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was there at the beginning in 2011, and stayed the course after so many left.

Brisbane got doused last week, but they’ve bobbed back up and made another prelim final. By rights they should be hosting it, having finished above Collingwood on the ladder, but the AFL isn’t going to turn down the chance to get 90,000 in at the MCG two days running. </p> <p>Brisbane were terrific in their approach tonight, despite having Lachie Neale watching on injured: they hassled and harassed and gave the Suns no space. There was a lack of polish in the forward line when it came to finishing off some moves, so that’s the main area that Brisbane need to fix up.</p> <p>As for Gold Coast, this is clearly their best season after being the punching bags of the comp for so long. It’s really not surprising that they were flat, after making the longest trip in football the previous week, Brisbane to Perth, and not just that but beating Fremantle, winning their first final, and doing it in the dying seconds of the game. That’s a huge emotional experience to process. Hopefully they’ll come back better for the run next year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c55e7a8f0880bae9c52e1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:10:07.458Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q4: 4 minutes remaining: Brisbane 14.16.100 – Gold Coast 6.9.45 </strong></p> <p>Cruising to the finish, Brisbane.

Suns defenders are working overtime but there’s nowhere to go once they break 50.</p> <p>Finally, they work a good sequence, with Anderson calm enough inside 50 to find Noble with a pass, but he misses the set shot to the left.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T11:06:26.318Z\">at 12.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c549458f086519d3271521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:39:46.135Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q2: 5 mins remaining: Brisbane 8.6.54 – Gold Coast 5.4.34</strong></p> <p>Rayner from full back, handballing on the rum, to Ashcroft, to McInerney in the centre square, long ball into the pocket, Lohmann marks on the approach, but was it touched?

They got absolutely belted by Geelong last week: even after being given three gift goals by the umpires, they only mustered 74 points, and a stack of those came in the fourth quarter once the Cats had put the cue in the rack. After an arm wrestle until halfway through the second quarter, Brisbane got blitzed by three-quarter time. And in the process they lost their star Lachie Neale with a calf injury.

    "description": "<p>Duo are the most productive T20 openers, with Salt’s goal to be ‘best in the world’ after record innings against South Africa</p>",
    "content": "<p>As he reflected on his epic individual contribution to a thrilling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">historic win for England</a> against South Africa on Friday, Phil Salt spoke about being inspired to ever greater heights by the people around him. “The mentality that we’ve had from when I started playing for England to now, we’re always trying to push things forward,” he said. “Always trying to take, you know, the next step in the game.”</p> <p>But over the past few years most of the steps taken by the white-ball side have been backwards. It is the Test team under Ben Stokes that have produced the thrills, while in shorter formats there has been a succession of spills. Jos Buttler, by general acclamation England’s greatest short-format player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/28/jos-buttler-steps-down-as-captain-of-englands-white-ball-cricket-team\">stood down as captain</a> in February after three years that started with victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup but came to be characterised by failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">Records tumble as Phil Salt’s stunning ton leads England to T20 rout of South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buttler, however, is now adding fresh gloss to his reputation and in the past week has looked in brilliant touch in scoring a 32-ball 62 in England’s one-day international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">romp against South Africa</a> in Southampton, being the only English batter to flourish in the abbreviated five-over thrashfest that launched the T20 series in Cardiff, and again at Old Trafford on Friday night, where he and Salt joyfully and emphatically reclaimed the opening berths.</p> <p>With Salt on paternity leave and Buttler at No 3, Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett opened during the T20 series against West Indies in June. But, with a breathless summer behind them and a hectic winter ahead, both were rested for these games and in their absence Salt and Buttler have reunited to make the idea of picking anyone else appear absurd.</p> <p>That Buttler dominates the list of England’s most-successful T20 opening partnerships is no surprise, but the fact he and Salt have been so productive as a pairing perhaps is. In 17 innings they have scored 967 runs, one short of the total Buttler and Jason Roy accumulated in 31, at an average of 60.43.</p> <p>Of all opening pairings with at least 15 outings over the past decade, none comes close to matching them, the only other couple averaging above 47 being Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz on 53.86. No other representatives of Test-playing nations get within sniffing distance of their run rate of 10.52.</p> <p>“We bounce off each other well,” Salt said. “We’ve got pretty set roles – it’s my job to get us off to as good a start as possible and give Jos the opportunity to take a couple of balls, because when he does he goes on and gets a match-winning score a lot of the time. We don’t often need to communicate. When he needs to get me on [strike], it just happens. And when I need to get him on. There’s no ego or anything like that, we just do it, and that’s a massive part of having a good opening partnership.”</p>    <p>Salt produced England’s highest T20 score with an unbeaten 141 on Friday, his fourth century in the format (Buttler has one, in more than three times as many innings). But there are many ways the former captain has assisted Salt’s success. The way they work together at the crease is the most obvious, but Buttler was also the inspiration and the challenge that pushed Salt to focus in particular on attacking the first over, something he now does better than any batter in the world.</p> <p>“In order to knock a man out of possession, you need to do something they can’t do,” Salt said. “I thought: ‘Right, if I can be the most dangerous in the first six, 10, 15 balls of the game, that’s quite a unique tool.’ I’m someone who’s always looking at ways to get better. The goal is to be right up there. I want to be the best in the world at this.”</p> <p>Perhaps England can rationally nurse that same goal, with another World Cup to be played in India and Sri Lanka in February. But first comes Sunday’s series decider at Trent Bridge and the challenge of proving that Friday was more than a glorious anomaly.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/its-going-to-be-a-life-skill-educators-discuss-the-impact-of-ai-on-university-education",
    "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence is changing how students learn and the world they’ll graduate into. Experts reveal how applicants can get ahead</p>",
    "content": "<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”</p> <p>Altman, whose company developed and released ChatGPT in November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.</p> <p>Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.</p> <p>For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in&nbsp;many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.</p> <p>“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”</p> <p>His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”</p> <p>Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.</p> <p>He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.</p> <p>“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”</p> <p>There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”</p> <p>Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.</p> <p>“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”</p> <p>For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.</p> <p>He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.” </p> <p>Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.</p> <p>Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”</p> <p>Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”</p> <p>In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.</p> <p>“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Just seven runners at Doncaster but plenty of depth and the appearance of a Derby winner adds significant interest </p>",
    "content": "<p>Just seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and features the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.</p> \n<p>Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/brighton-owner-tony-bloom-nets-another-winner-with-santorini-star-at-doncaster-horse-racing\">Brighton owner Tony Bloom nets another winner with Santorini Star at Doncaster</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.</p> \n<p>All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.</p> \n<p>He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip. Scandinavia and Carmers will offer strong opposition, but <strong>Lambourn (3.40)</strong> has been edging ever close to the top of the betting in recent days and still looks fairly priced at about 5-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76eabbec-cd0a-4d04-9a3e-338198e48c4b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster </b>1.15 Treble Tee 2.50 Gewan 2.25 Apollo One (nap) 3.00 Shadow Of Light 3.40 Lambourn 4.15 Mr Wonka 4.50 Fantasy Believer</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield </b>1.25 One Million Dreams 1.58 Beccadelli 2.33 Rogue Dynasty 3.13 Kingsclere 3.55 Summertime Blues 4.30 Parish Councillor 5.00 Clearpoint</p>\n    <p><b>Chester </b>1.35 Wild Dahlia 2.05 Military Academy 2.40 Ndaawi (nb) 3.23 Hanney Girl 4.00 Glistening Nights 4.35 Giant 5.05 Heathen 5.35 Sir Edward Lear</p>\n    <p><b>Bath </b>3.28 Somebodycomegether 4.05 Cloudbuster 4.40 Under Curfew 5.10 Goodwood Mogul 5.40 Tamzan 6.13 Baynoona 6.45 Blue Point Express 7.15 Mrs Meader</p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh </b>4.10 Martin’s Brig 4.45 Welbury 5.18 Straight Ahead 5.50 Penn Avenue 6.22 Maghlaak 6.52 Red Mirage 7.22 Sixcor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.15</strong> Easier ground could be what <strong>Treble Tee</strong> needs to return to winning form after excellent efforts in defeat on his last two starts.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.50</strong> <strong>Gewan </strong>showed a good attitude to maintain his unbeaten record at York last month and is narrowly preferred to Oxagon, a wide-margin winner last time out.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.05</strong> There is little to choose between Hamish, the warm favourite, and <strong>Military Academy</strong> on their form at Goodwood in June, so a 3lb swing in favour of John &amp; Thady Gosden’s gelding makes him a logical pick at the likely odds.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 2.25</strong> <strong>Apollo One </strong>has been operating below his best so far this season but he was an unlucky loser of this race 12 months ago, behind a subsequent Group One winner in American Affair, and is 1lb lower in the ratings this time around.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.40</strong> Gordon Elliott’s <strong>Ndaawi </strong>trailed home in last place in the Cesarewitch on his latest start on the Flat but two big runs in ultra-competitive handicap hurdles since that setback suggest that he remains well handicapped on the level.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 3.00</strong> A slight ease in grade could see <strong>Shadow Of Light, </strong>last year’s Dewhurst winner, gain a confidence-boosting win.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7857ae84-4e63-4c8f-aa77-f7c4847110de\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster</b> 1.20 Stormy Monday 1.55 Obito 2.30 Indian Springs 3.00 Royal Velvet 3.35 Beaming Light 4.10 Queen Of Mougins (nb) 4.40 Hiya Maite 5.18 Arnhem&nbsp;<br><b>Bath</b> 2.00 Spinning Dancer 2.35 Karakula Dancer 3.08 Bohemian Breeze 3.43 Asinara 4.18 Supreme Diamond 4.50 Call Time 5.28 Albus Anne&nbsp;<br><b>Musselburgh</b> 2.15 Farandaway 2.50 Parisian Scholar 3.25 Rory The Cat 4.00 Drumcondra (nap) 4.33 I’m Next 5.08 This Years Love 5.43 Sanditon</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sweet William is punters’ darling again</h2> \n<p>There are horses that win with a minimum of fuss, and others, like Sweet William, that have a style that is all their own, and John &amp; Thady Gosden’s stayer kept it interesting throughout in the Doncaster Cup on Friday, as he overcame a slow start and some early coaxing from Rab Havlin in his saddle to win the Group Two contest for the second year running.</p> \n<p>Sweet William has often appeared to have his own ideas about the racing game during a 20-race career, with slow starts and mid-race flat spots frequently forcing Havlin to get busy at an early stage.</p> \n<p>When he eventually goes through the gears, however, he is a very difficult horse to keep out of the frame, and while his latest win was his first since the same race 12 months ago, his fourth-place finish in this year’s Ascot Gold Cup was the only time he has been outside the first three. His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.</p> \n<p>Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.</p> \n<p>Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”</p> \n<p>There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn. “Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”</p> \n<p>An impressive display of raw, frontrunning speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.</p> \n<p>“She’s a natural frontrunner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Hakluyt – formerly run by Varun Chandra – has been advising utilities company as it tries to avoid renationalisation</p>",
    "content": "<p>A corporate intelligence company part-owned and formerly run by the prime minister’s business adviser has been paid more than £1m by Thames Water as the utilities firm tries to avoid renationalisation, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Hakluyt, which was run by Varun Chandra until his appointment as Keir Starmer’s business adviser last July, has worked with Thames since 2023, providing political and strategic advice.</p> <p>That commercial relationship between Thames and Hakluyt has continued since Chandra joined No 10. He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.</p> <p>That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/varun-chandra-starmer-adviser-proving-vital-link-for-labour-in-us-trade-talks\">still owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluyt</a> and is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.</p> <p>In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.</p> <p>Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.</p> <p>The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.</p> <p>It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.</p>    <p>It was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.</p> <p>Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.</p> <p>Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.</p> <p>The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/rachel-reeves-thames-water-creditors\">wrote to creditors of the company in July</a> to say a “market-based solution” was her preference.</p> <p>Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.</p> <p>Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.</p> <p>That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.</p> <p>A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/bidders-demand-thames-water-granted-immunity-over-environmental-crimes\">leniency from fines and penalties</a>. They have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/creditors-set-out-20bn-plan-to-save-thames-water\">delivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five years</a> than had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.</p>    <p>Chandra is one of Starmer’s most influential advisers, and has spearheaded its attempts to ingratiate Labour with business and attract foreign capital to the UK.</p> <p>He accompanied Reeves on her visit to the World Economic Forum in January, and was in the Oval Office when Starmer met Donald Trump in February.</p> <p>Chandra has also been central to Labour’s more muscular attempts to burnish its business credentials. It is understood he was behind the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/chair-of-competition-watchdog-steps-down-after-labour-intervention\">oust the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, Marcus Bokkerink</a>, amid concerns the watchdog was holding back growth.</p> <p>The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in South Shields, Chandra helped Tony Blair set up his first advisory firm, before becoming Hakluyt’s managing partner in 2019. As of May he held Hakluyt shares worth about £7m<strong>.</strong> The company, which was founded in 1995, was named after the Elizabethan writer, priest and diplomat Richard Hakluyt.</p> <p>Hakluyt has reportedly said it plans to buy back Chandra’s shares over time and that he no longer has any voting rights or decision-making roles within the company.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the company said: “Hakluyt is a global strategic advisory firm providing insight and advice to commercial clients on a range of issues. We are not a lobbying organisation and do not lobby governments on behalf of clients.”</p> <p>A Thames spokesperson said: “We remain focused on a market-led solution which we believe is in the best interest of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy.”</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson said: “The Cabinet Office has a thorough process on declarations of interest for special advisers to ensure any conflicts of interest are properly managed and mitigated, including through recusals where appropriate.”</p>",

In fact, it is a scientific simulation – and for the first time a British pilot is among those training for the mission.</p> <p>Laura Marie, who was born in the UK and is now a pilot for a regional airline in the US, beat about 8,000 applicants to become one of six research volunteers who are preparing to spend 378 days inside the 158-sq-metre (1,700 sq ft) Mars Dune Alpha habitat at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p> <p>“It’s such a huge opportunity,” Marie told the Guardian. “And then to come this far and be in the final crew selection and heading down to training very, very soon is extremely exciting.”</p> <p>While the four “primary” crew members – Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery and James Spicer – are expecting to enter the simulation on 19 October, Marie – who has a BA in philosophy and an MSc in aeronautics – is one of two “alternate” participants, ready to step in should any of the others drop out.</p> <p>Marie said: “I am going down there with the same kind of mindset that everyone is going down there, of it being the 378 days.”</p> <p>The second of three Chapea (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/chapea/\">Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog</a>) missions, the experience is designed to help inform crewed missions to the red planet itself. The idea is the simulations will enable the collection of data relating to the physical health, psychology and performance of humans undertaking such an endeavour, with Nasa saying it could also aid assessment of its space food system.</p> <p>As in the first mission, the new crew will be growing crops, carrying out robotic operations and conducting simulated Mars walks, as well as testing technology designed for use on Mars, among other activities.</p> <p>“With science, you can’t just do something once,” said Marie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">Life on Mars ‘absolutely exhilarating’: Nasa scientist’s year in a simulation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marie, who grew up in Devon and immigrated to the US in 2016, said she was inspired to apply after hearing about the first mission as it was in progress.</p> <p>“I always had an interest professionally in working with Nasa in some kind of capacity,” she said. “So everything kind of aligned. I saw that opportunity and I jumped for it.”</p> <p>However while the first mission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">ended in the summer of 2024</a>, Marie has not spoken to the crew involved, noting it is better for the data if team members are not influenced by the experiences of others.</p> <p>While training is set to start next week at the Johnson Space Center, Marie said she and the other team members had already spent time together as part of the rigorous and lengthy selection process.</p> <p>“I’m not worried about any of the crew dynamics. I would happily lock myself in a box with all of them,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/12/nasa-texas-humans-prepare-mars\">Inside the 3D-printed box in Texas where humans will prepare for Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the mission could still bring challenges. “I’m a big nature girl. I spend a lot of time outside,” Marie said, adding the lack of sensations such as wind in her hair or the smell of grass could be difficult.</p> <p>Another significant challenge will be the communication delays that are designed to mimic the lag astronauts would experience on Mars when contacting Earth.</p> <p>“There’s no live chat with mission control,” said Marie, noting that even on the international space station, astronauts can be in real-time contact with Earth.</p> <p>But there will also be downtime, with Marie revealing she will be packing a Rubik’s Cube. “I’m not just going to learn how to do it. I want to beat a record,” she said.</p> <p>While the new mission is only a simulation of the Martian landscape, Marie said she would jump at an opportunity to head to the red planet itself. Indeed Nasa is developing technologies to enable crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.</p> <p>“One hundred per cent I would take that seat on that ride if it were ever offered to me,” Marie said. “I think the whole multi-planetary species, it’s where we’re heading. And anything I can do to be a part of it – if it’s this [Chapea programme], if it’s something else – I’m just happy to be involved.”</p>",

The Florida department of health and DeSantis also did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>In a Substack <a href=\"https://briannaladapo.substack.com/p/freedom-our-forgotten-birthright\">post</a> on 5 September, Brianna Ladapo defended her husband’s decision to end vaccine mandates and claimed there are “dubious origins, nonexistent safety profiles, and dirty money trails surrounding vaccines”.</p> <p>She wrote in the post: “You believe in vaccines because you’ve been told to by a corrupt medical establishment that has a vested interest in keeping you subservient and stupid.”</p> <p>In a July 2025 <a href=\"https://new.clouthub.com/wpstream_vod/truth-be-told-with-brianna-ladapo/\">podcast</a>, Brianna Ladapo stated: “I often think if I hadn’t had to learn to trust my own gut and learn how to think and stand on my own two feet at such a young age, when Covid had come through, apparently swept away everyone’s brains, I might have been swept away right along with it if I didn’t already know how to listen to that truth that I believe is inside every single one of us.”</p> <p>She added in the podcast that “even to the lead-up, I was having visions, I was having dreams”, about the pandemic, before it began in early 2020. “Immediately, ridiculous inconsistencies started to show themselves.”</p> <p>She also appeared in an <a href=\"https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd-2024/bird-flu--polio-vaccine-nonsense--exclusive-interview-brianna-ladapo/\">interview</a> with the prominent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/health/cdc-kennedy-vaccine-disinformation.html\">anti-vaccine group</a> Children’s Health Defense in January 2025, in which she said: “If we all listen to our intuition, we listen to that voice, we would not fall for propaganda. Like, what’s happened with Covid. People did truly insane things to keep from catching a virus that over, well over 99% of people survived without intervention, right? That’s textbook insanity.”</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo has <a href=\"https://www.briannaladapo.com/events\">appeared</a> with his wife on stage at conferences on health and parenting.</p> <p>In Dr Ladapo’s 2022 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Fear-Blueprint-Mindful-Leadership/dp/1510774718?asin=1510774718&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1\">Transcend Fear</a>, he wrote that his wife has “a history of extraordinary experiences that were hard to explain with natural laws”. In March 2020, he wrote an op-ed for USA Today against shutdowns in response to Covid-19, the first of several he wrote about the virus, and noted that it was edited by his wife.</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo wrote in Transcend Fear that when he was recruited for the job of Florida surgeon general by DeSantis, his wife claimed it was the message she was waiting for.</p> <p>In Brianna Ladapo’s 2023 memoir, she <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Darkness-Spiritual-Memoir-Guide/dp/1510777849/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/144-3976682-3640302?pd_rd_w=Akdd8&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_r=XYZ73YX77CX1PQ6JDCH7&amp;pd_rd_wg=xp7jc&amp;pd_rd_r=c80b87c1-1823-489a-ac31-eb9b82d637cf&amp;pd_rd_i=1510777849&amp;psc=1\">claimed</a> “as long as I can remember, I have received communications from beings beyond this realm. Even as a young child, angels regularly spoke to me.”</p> <p>She added that “since I was born, I have also received constant communications in the form of visions” and that “eventually, every single one of them came to pass”.</p> <p>In the book, Brianna Ladapo claims she went on a “<a href=\"https://canvasrebel.com/meet-brianna-ladapo/\">pilgrimage</a>” trip to Egypt in graduate school during which she saw the rest of a “recurring vision” from a past life.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">video podcast on Rumble</a> earlier this year, she reiterated these claims about her “gifts”.</p> <p>“I was born a very sensitive child, the kind of kid who would see angels and talk to beings that no one else could necessarily perceive,” she said, claiming her family “perceived what was happening to me as satanic and demonic and evil”.</p> <p>“I saw a lot of angels, but my angels would talk to me and they saved my life multiple times,” she claimed.</p> <p>Brianna Ladapo also claimed their children together “have all been having experiences like this since they were born” and have “innate divine intelligence”.</p> <p>She claimed one of her children as a baby had “a gift” that was temporarily shared with her.</p> <p>“I started to hear conversations that sounded like they were right next to me. There were no people anywhere near us. And they were clearly from different eras, sometimes different countries, different languages and dialects,” Ladapo said.</p> <p>She said initially in their relationship, her husband was skeptical, but came to believe in her “gifts”.</p> <p>“After a number of years, he came to deeply trust my gift and now he won’t work with anybody I haven’t vetted,” she said. The couple did not respond to requests for comment about Brianna Ladapo’s vetting.</p> <p>Later in the podcast, Ladapo claimed she floated an inch above the ground during a session with a former Navy Seal and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christopherleemaher/?hl=en\">self-proclaimed traditional healing guru</a>, whom she said her husband had also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6929057317183203\">seen</a> and had similar experiences with. The healer declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.</p> <p>Ladapo is also a proponent of the chemtrails <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">conspiracy theory</a> about planes mass-dumping chemicals. She claims in the podcast interview that she and her children got sick because of chemtrails, and she used a patch that has been characterized as<a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/pseudoscience-technology/patchy-science-lifewaves-mysterious-patches\"> pseudoscience</a> by medical experts.</p> <p>“As we try to chase down where this is coming from, who is funding the companies who are flying the planes, who are piloting these planes, where are they taking off? We don’t even know where they are, because none of this is on the books.” Ladapo said about chemtrails.</p> <p>She added in the <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">podcast interview</a> about a photo of a Florida sky outside of her home: “This is how the chemtrails have been looking outside our window for the past few weeks. They are, I hate to say it, but that looks like a pentagram and they’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks.”</p> <p>She characterized the perceived chemtrailers as “dark forces” out to get her and her husband.</p> <p>“They’ve been trying to stop us for years,” she claimed. “We are operating at a level of light that puts us essentially out of the grasp of those with a very low vibration, very evil intention.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/13/former-aide-to-de-facto-leader-of-georgia-being-held-as-personal-prisoner-mother-claims",
    "description": "<p>Marina Ramazashvili says son, Giorgi Bachiashvili, was the victim of a ‘vendetta’ by billionaire politician</p>",
    "content": "<p>The mother of a jailed former aide to Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused the de facto leader of Georgia of treating her son as his “personal prisoner” as she appealed to the west for help.</p> <p>Marina Ramazashvili, a renowned ophthalmologist in Georgia, said Giorgi Bachiashvili, who has allegedly been beaten in his prison cell, was the victim of a “vendetta” waged by the billionaire politician.</p> <p>The Georgian government, led by Ivanishvili, has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/mamuka-mdinaradze-to-be-georgia-security-chief-as-report-warns-of-descent-into-authoritarianism\">slipping into autocracy</a>, with the courts and the prosecution service increasingly under political control.</p> <p>“Maybe he is evil,” Ramazashvili, 65, said of Ivanishvili. “He has no humanity, he has no empathy. My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.</p> <p>Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.</p> <p>At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.</p> <p>Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/giorgi-bachiashvili-interview-georgia-bidzina-ivanishvili\">claimed in an interview with the Guardian</a> from his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.</p> <p>Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.</p> <p>Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.</p> <p>He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.</p> <p>He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.</p> <p>A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.</p> <p>“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”</p> <p>Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.</p> <p>Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.</p> <p>She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”</p> <p>Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.</p> <p>Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.</p> <p>“I have nothing inside,” she said.</p>",

    "title": "Partial to pre-drinks and a party? Your guide to getting the most out of student nightlife",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife",
    "description": "<p>The social side of university is good for your mental health and friendship circle, so consider where you’d be happiest to hang out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Choosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing.</p> <p>“Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the university <a href=\"https://yorksu.org/activities/view/album-society\">album society</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”.</p> <p>“Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs.</p> <p>But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan.</p> <p>“A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.”</p> <p>Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities.</p> <p>The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink.</p> <p>So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequently<a href=\"https://www.studentcrowd.com/page/best-universities-for-students-union\"> ranked best in the UK</a>, while the city’s DIY music scene<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/23/not-all-grassroots-venues-are-struggling-sheffields-leadmill-may-be-closing-but-the-citys-diy-hubs-are-thriving\"> continues to thrive</a>. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds.</p> <p>For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as&nbsp;possible. “You only get the university experience&nbsp;once.”</p>",

But Hull said she is focused on the longer distance for now “before I become an 800m runner on Wednesday”.</p> <p>Hull said she was “very surprised” to hear of the withdrawal of Ethiopian Diribe Welteji, one of the 1500m medal contenders, due to an anti-doping dispute with World Athletics. “[It was] not something I’ve really predicted at all in having competed against her very often,” she said.</p> <p>Linden Hall joins Hull in the 1500m semi-finals after finishing fourth in her heat.</p> <p>In the morning session, Australian fans found reason to celebrate despite a lack of medals<strong> </strong>after Canadian Evan Dunfee won the meet’s first gold in the 35km race walk.</p> <p>The 34-year-old has made Australia his home over summer for much of the past decade in a bid to avoid the Canadian winter, and broke the North American record in February at the Australian 20km race walking championships in Adelaide.</p> <p>Australia’s own walkers also performed well in the stifling conditions, led by Rebecca Henderson who finished ninth behind women’s winner María Pérez from Spain.</p> <p>“I knew on my best day I could probably be around that eighth to 12th and that happened, so I’m really happy,” Henderson said.</p> <p>The Australian finished strongly, and overtook Peruvian Kimberly García in the final kilometre. “I just tried to stay relaxed at the start and not worry if people got ahead because I knew it was hot and people were definitely going to come back to me throughout the race.”</p>    <p>In the men’s race, Dunfee’s first major international gold medal was close as he led by nearly a minute in the final kilometres in the course looping around the streets of Tokyo.</p> <p>But in late drama the Canadian clutched his hamstring and briefly stopped and stretched. He struggled on to defeat Brazilian Caio Bonfim by 33 seconds, with Hayato Katsuki delivering bronze for the host nation.</p> <p>Dunfee said he stayed patient, and the result was a dream come true. “The last two kilometres felt like the hardest ones I have ever done,” he said. “I had to channel all my strength for all the people back home.”</p> <p>In a steamy race brought forward by half an hour in a bid to avoid the worst of the Tokyo heat, Rhydian Cowley was best of the Australian men finishing in 11th, having overcome a hamstring injury that curtailed his preparations.</p> <p>Liv Sandery slowed in the final stages to finish 14th in the women’s event, and Alannah Pitcher crossed the line in 19th.</p> <p>Henderson and Cowley will race again in the 20km event in a week’s time.</p> <p>Inside the stadium to end the morning session on the first day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/13/gout-gout-australia-athletics-world-championships-tokyo-2025-torrie-lewis\">Australia’s mixed 4x400m relay team</a> was eliminated after finishing fifth in their semi-final.</p> <p>The United States’ lineup set the fastest time in the morning session, and Saturday’s night’s final is set to be a memorable occasion after Japan snuck through as the final qualifier.</p>",

It was a moment – six Premier League games into his tenure – when people wondered whether his team might be the real thing. In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> \n  <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c544f78f086519d32714f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:26:00.709Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news: Arsenal v Nottingham Forest</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Eberechi Eze starts for the Gunners,</strong> as does Cristhian Mosquera with William Saliba out.

By all accounts he left coaches to do the coaching, as he well should, so we probably won’t really start seeing the impact of his successors until January or even next summer.

The defending champions have won all three of their fixtures so far but required late goals against Bournemouth and Newcastle after twice conceding two-goal leads, which pointed to defensive frailties.</p> \n  <p>Against Burnley on Sunday he will again need those resources up front - now bolstered by British-record signing Alexander Isak - against a team they will find hard to break down. Liverpool have scored eight goals, the most in the top flight, without creating that many clear-cut chances and Slot was asked how he hoped to improve that.</p> \n  <p>“To implement as best as possible the way we want to play,” he said.”But in the end the final third, it is also the form of your wingers mainly because of their playing style you end up more on the sides. The better they are, the bigger threat they are, the more chances we will generate and then nine out of 10 times it is about scoring.</p> \n  <p>“If you can score an early goal that normally helps you in a game like that. There are a lot of factors going into a game like this but as always we are hoping that our attackers make the difference and that is what they have to do every single game.”<br>But while Slot wants them to score the goals he also wants his attackers to improve their work-rate and defensive capabilities.</p> \n  <p>“If we lose the ball if we are really good in our counter-pressing that can create chances as well,” he added. “That is for me the biggest lesson of our game against Arsenal: in the first half we weren’t front-footed enough in terms of our pressing. In the second half we were and as a result we deserved to score in the second half.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c527628f084b3c85a4e024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:15:33.522Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Talking of Fitba, this piece, from the consistently excellent Nutmeg, is terrific*</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/smartphones-eroding-experience-watching-football-phones-escapism-games-impatiece\">Are smartphones eroding the experience of watching football?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><em>* Opinion, not fact</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c526928f084b3c85a4e021\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:11:47.681Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>As well as the big game at Easter Road, Rangers host high-flying Hearts at Ibrox with Russell Martin still looking for his first league win. </p> \n  <p>Rangers have drawn all four Premiership games under Martin, including a forgettable derby a fortnight ago.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report\">Martin and Rodgers feel heat as Rangers and Celtic fans boo drab stalemate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c4289b8f0880bae9c524f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:00:07.094Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arsenal v Nottm Forest x Big Ange (12.30pm)</strong></p> \n  <p>Will Unwin looks at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f8elrGU3AdU\">Nottingham Forest’s surprise decision</a> to sack Nuno Espírito Santo and replace him with Ange Postecoglou.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78b2d1ec-a634-45bc-a0b9-378ce95a2ca3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yz3PD1i880A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c523b68f084b3c85a4e012\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T07:58:33.988Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>“Oh matchday live, how could you?” <s>thunders</s> says Simon McMahon. “You forgot about about Dundee United’s trip to Easter Road to face Hibs at 5.45pm, so please, allow me.

    "description": "<p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. And the denim discourse is insufferable</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you are wearing clothes. Or my byline photo made you spontaneously strip down to nothing but a pair of crusty underwear and a smile. I don’t judge, and I also don’t blame you. That photo is from a decade ago.</p> <p>Assuming you’re in clothes, then you had to decide what to wear. It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only. Like a kid’s birthday or a hangover.</p> <p>You know what you won’t find in my closet?</p> <p>Jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\">Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel Connolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I hate jeans. Not even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK8s3iqL99c\">poorly conceived Sydney Sweeney commercial</a> could convince me I needed to buy jeans. If I had to choose between wearing denim and one of those <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GUN-GONE-GOONS-BARREL.png\">barrels cartoon hobos wear</a>, I’d choose the barrel. Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks. I panned for gold once, on a school field trip to <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485\">Sutter’s Fort</a> in fifth grade. I was not asked to go pro.</p> <p>Jeans make some people look like Bruce Springsteen – macho, blue collar and soulful. Jeans make me look like my dad – balding, with bad posture and a curious mustard stain on my crotch. Suits make me look grown up. Jeans make me look ground down. They make me look washed, cooked, chopped and all the other things my kid yells at me when I try to bend over to pick up one of his toys and I screech in pain.</p> <p>You can wear jeans if you want. I won’t stop you, but please, cease and desist with the denim discourse. A <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/bring-skinny-jeans-back\">recent GQ article</a> from July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/sperry-boat-shoes-hooked-me\">Another GQ article from this year</a>, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, or <a href=\"https://bamfstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wowspolo-main.jpg\">Jordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime</a>.</p> <p>I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)\">The Crow</a>. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.</p> <p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.</p> <p>I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.</p> <p>Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.</p> <p>The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/10/pradas-125bn-versace-takeover-a-new-era-for-italian-luxury\">controlled by billionaire conglomerates</a> that care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion is <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/shein-designated-biggest-fashion-polluter-bb25de66/\">contributing to global pollution</a> at an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.</p> <p>Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>Sainsbury’s has recalled two varieties of its own-brand hummus over fears they may contain a deadly strain of E coli, advising customers who have bought the products not to eat them.</p> <p>The affected items are 315g containers of JS Classic Houmous, with a use-by date of 13 September, and 200g tubs of JS Lemon &amp; Coriander Houmous with a use-by date of 14 September.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency said the affected batches could contain shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), and that the items had been recalled as a precaution.</p> <p>Point of sale notices will be displayed in all stores selling the products until 3 October, explaining to customers why they have been recalled and what to do if they have already bought them.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s apologised to customers for any inconvenience and advised them not to eat the affected products.</p> <p>The products covered by the recall can be returned to Sainsbury’s branches for a full refund.</p> <p>Symptoms of an E coli (Stec) infection include diarrhoea, with bleeding in half of cases, fever and abdominal pain. The illness is usually self-limiting. Most cases lasting up to two weeks.</p> <p>A small proportion of patients, mainly children, could develop life-threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure. A similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may also develop in a small proportion of adults.</p> <p>Stec bacteria are most prevalent in cattle in the UK, but have also been found in the faeces of deer, rabbits, horses, pigs and wild birds.</p> <p>Government guidance says the strain is particularly infectious because very few bacteria are needed to cause illness, allowing the disease to spread easily within families and other settings such as hospitals and schools.</p> <p>People can become ill through eating contaminated food, contact with infected animals or people who have the illness, and drinking water from inadequately treated sources.</p> <p>The UK Health Security Agency said there were 2,544 cases of Stec infection in England in 2024, a 26% rise compared with the year before.</p> <p>Several supermarkets were forced to ditch products in June last year when the sandwich makers Greencore and Samworth Brothers recalled their items during another outbreak of E coli.</p> <p>The two producers had to recall 60 products found to contain a variety of salad leaf linked to a Stec outbreak.</p>",

    "description": "<p>PM understood not to have seen messages from former ambassador to sex offender when speaking in Commons</p>",
    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer defended Peter Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and Jeffrey Epstein were passed to Downing Street, according to reports.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA.</p> <p>The prime minister is understood not to have been aware of the contents of the emails until Wednesday evening. By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer and Labour MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”. <br><br>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.</p> <p>“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> <p>“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”</p> <p>She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.</p> <p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”</p> <p>He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.</p> <p>The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.</p> <p>It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.</p> <p>His friendship with Epstein was known before his appointment, however, and he is reported to have told the Times that he admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with the convicted sex offsender for many years.</p> <p>Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer has “confidence in his top team” when asked whether questions had been raised over the judgment of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was reported to have lobbied for Mandelson’s appointment.</p> <p>The backbencher Clive Lewis publicly questioned Starmer’s leadership, telling the BBC the prime minister does not seem “up to the job”.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, another MP from the party’s backbenches, said “toxic” resentment was festering among the party’s MPs and rank and file members.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, one of two candidates to take Angela Rayner’s place as Labour’s deputy leader, called for a change of culture.</p> <p>“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” she said.</p> <p>Downing Street has been contacted for comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Labour donor Lord Alli evicted a family of five from one of his rental properties before increasing the rent by nearly £1,000 a month.</p> <p>The family, who have school-age children, had lived in the five-bedroom north London townhouse for four years, paying £4,800 a month.</p> <p>Days after they were handed a section 21 “no fault” eviction notice in June, the property was re-listed for £6,000 a month, amounting to a 25% increase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">Can Keir survive? Inside the plot to bring down the prime minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood that the existing tenants offered to pay this increase in full, but this offer was refused. The home was then re-let to new tenants for £5,700 per month, a 19% increase.</p> <p>The government is planning to abolish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jan/14/tenants-landlords-discuss-renters-reform-bill\">no-fault evictions</a> under the renters’ rights bill and, in many situations, ban landlords from relisting their properties at higher rents for at least six months after evicting a tenant.</p> <p>Waheed Alli, who is worth an estimated £200m, has donated over £500,000 to Labour since 2020 and is one of the party’s largest donors. He spent weeks in the spotlight last year due to the tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, including spectacles and clothes donations to Starmer’s wife, Victoria. Starmer has also made temporary use of a £18m penthouse that belonged to Alli.</p> <p>No-fault evictions are one of the leading causes of homelessness, according to the charity Shelter, because they give landlords the power to evict tenants with just two months’ notice, without giving any reason for the eviction.</p> <p>The father of the family who was evicted from Alli’s house told the i newspaper they pleaded with the property’s management agent to allow them to meet the increased asking price and stay in the property: “We have children who were settled in local schools … so we wanted to avoid the disruption if we could.</p> <p>“We asked if there was any chance that we could even just stay an extra month so the kids wouldn’t be disrupted in September, and we could get through exams, but it was a no.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/labour-deputy-contender-lucy-powell-calls-for-culture-change-at-no-10\">Labour deputy contender Lucy Powell calls for culture change at No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking on Alli’s position as a Labour peer and major donor, the father added: “The hypocrisy just feels like too much … I voted Labour and I’m just incredibly disappointed.”</p> <p>Before Labour came to power, the government promised to “immediately abolish no fault eviction”, but has yet to name an implementation date for the renters’ rights bill. Recent Ministry of Justice data revealed that 11,400 households in England were forcibly removed from their homes by bailiffs as a result of these evictions between July 2024 and June 2025.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alli refused to explain the reasons the family were evicted. She said: “Lord Alli is not a commercial landlord and he doesn’t manage – and has never managed – this property. This is his former home where he no longer lives and where one tenant was replaced with another for less money than the former tenant offered and at an amount lower than the market price. Clearly, this was not about money.”</p> <p>The news comes a month after Rushanara Ali resigned as the government’s homelessness minister after it emerged she had evicted four tenants from a property she owns, then re-let it weeks later for £700 more a month.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a story fit for the pages of a Hollywood screenplay, with a California actor moving to a town in north Manchester to restore his dilapidated ancestral home.</p> <p>But Hopwood DePree’s romance plot has transformed instead to a horror, after he found himself locked out the building he was restoring, and now battling the local council in court for possession of the property.</p> <p>DePree, 55, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/02/his-ancestral-home-is-a-tip-the-californian-restoring-rochdales-grandest-house\">has been leading efforts to restore Grade II* listed Hopwood Hall</a> in Middleton since 2017, under an agreement with the local authority, which gave him an option to buy the building.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/wytham-abbey-asking-price-slashed-by-60-per-cent-after-failure-to-find-buyer\">Wytham Abbey’s asking price slashed by 60% after failure to find buyer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has written a book about his efforts to restore the derelict hall, which he has nicknamed “Downton Shabby”, and which once hosted Lord Byron. It still contains an ornate fireplace that the poet gifted to the then owners.</p> <p>In November last year, DePree said, Rochdale council “suddenly locked the gates to the hall without any warning whatsoever”, with the local authority saying the American had not upheld his part of the deal.</p> <p>“It was a big shock and really devastating,” he said, “because so many of our volunteers from the community have been putting in five years rescuing the gardens that were completely in rack and ruin, and they turned them around into award-winning gardens.”</p> <p>DePree said he had “no confidence” in the council to secure the future of the building, and wanted to be allowed to carry on with the restoration project he had been spearheading for the best part of a decade.</p> <p>The actor said it was “really upsetting” to be told he had not made enough progress on the project, adding: “It’s been years and years of my life.”</p> <p>“I sold my house to help enable everything moving forward, and I left everything behind,” he said. “At this point, it’s been over 10 years that I’ve been involved, and I moved to England in 2017.</p> <p>“I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of my own personal money to make this happen.</p> <p>“I’m completely invested in it, and also I believe in the community,” he added. “I know how much hard work that we put in that at this point, this building has to be saved.”</p> <p>DePree said he has spent almost 11 months “trying to work with Rochdale council to find a resolution”, but now felt he had been “left with no choice but to sue Rochdale council in the high court” in order “to force them to honour our agreement”.</p>    <p>DePree’s lawyer, Nick Wells, said: “We have reviewed many years of documents and emails and eventually obtained some previously unseen evidence through freedom of information and subject access requests, many of which Rochdale borough council tried to block.” </p> <p>Wells said “the evidence points to the council having changed its position since entering into the option agreement in 2017”.</p> <p>“We are therefore asking the high court to intervene and hold Rochdale council to the decisions that they made in 2017,” he added, “rather than the decisions they have purported to have made in 2024.”</p> <p>In a previous life, Michigan-born DePree was an actor, film-maker, and writer, who once won a deal with Warner Bros to produce and star in his own television show.</p> <p>He grew up listening to stories of the family’s ancestral home in England, but believed them to be fairytales, until he began researching his family tree online, and discovered his Manchester roots.</p> <p>“I’ve given up my life for this building,” he said. “I came over to visit it first in 2013, just to see it. My grandfather was also named Hopwood, so he told me stories about it.</p> <p>“I felt that if I didn’t do something that it would fall into being lost forever,” he added. “So I gave up my life. I moved over from the US to the UK. I completely trusted the council at the time; I thought we were working in partnership together.”</p>    <p>Rochdale council said it does not comment on continuing legal proceedings, but pointed to previous statements it had made about the hall.</p> <p>A spokesperson said in November: “In 2017, the council entered into an options agreement with Hopwood DePree which gave him the option to buy the building for a nominal fee if he could produce a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall, alongside a detailed planning permission.</p> <p>“Although this agreement has been renewed a number of times since 2017, a viable business case and funding strategy has not been forthcoming, and so the council’s cabinet has made the decision to not renew the options agreement.”</p> <p>“The council sees Hopwood Hall as a very important part of Middleton’s heritage,” the spokesperson said, adding that alongside other public bodies such as Historic England, it had invested almost £1.7m into the building over the past seven years.</p> <p>The council said it had “commissioned independent financial consultants to assess the business model proposed by Hopwood Productions and they concluded that these proposals would be loss-making and unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding”.</p> <p>“As Hopwood Depree has not been able to produce a viable proposal, despite having had seven years to do so,” the council said that in order to protect public money invested in the building it had “a responsibility to explore alternative options”.</p> <p>“The council remains committed to the long-term future of the hall,” the spokesperson added, “and is keen to see it restored, so it can be brought into a viable future use.”</p>",

It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p> <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\" data-alt=\"Inflation chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p> <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p> <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p> <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p> <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p> <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p> <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p> <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p> <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p> <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\" data-alt=\"jobs chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p> <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty\">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p> <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p> <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas, new report says, amid low awareness of disease</p>",
    "content": "<p>In February, Luna donated blood at her high school in Miami, with the goal of helping save others.</p> <p>“She was very proud to come home and say, ‘I gave blood today,’” her mother, Valerie, said. (The Guardian is not using the mother or daughter’s full names to protect their privacy.)</p> <p>It turned out, she was not able to save someone else’s life but potentially prevented herself from having serious health issues.</p> <p>A couple months later, she received a letter from the blood donation company informing her that she could not give blood. She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.</p> <p>Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.</p> <p>“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,’ … you’re like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.</p> <p>Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.</p> <p>Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.</p> <p>They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.</p> <p>“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”</p> <p>Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p> <p>It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.</p> <p>Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.</p> <p>About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.</p> <p>It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(10)01160-1/fulltext\">Gastroenterology journal</a>.</p> <p>More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs’ natural environment”, Beatty said.</p> <p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC’s <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article\">Emerging Infectious Diseases</a> journal.</p> <p>But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2953998/\">2010 survey</a> conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.</p> <p>“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that’s something that doesn’t exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.</p> <p>But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)</p> <p>Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.</p> <p>“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.</p> <p>After Valerie received the letter about Luna’s infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.</p> <p>That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.</p> <p>Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.</p> <p>Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.</p> <p>The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.</p> <p>The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.</p> <p>While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it’s less likely, Beatty said.</p> <p>“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>The sport, a popular pastime of the white elite during the colonial period, has struggled in recent years, but its fortunes may be changing</p>",
    "content": "<p>The spectators on the grandstand at Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi jumped to their feet as the horses competing in the fifth race of the Day of Champions – the last meeting of the season – came around the final corner on a recent Sunday afternoon. “Bedford! Bedford! Bedford,” some roared, punching the air as the horse, jockeyed by Michael Fundi, broke into a gallop on the home stretch, passed the leader, and stormed to victory.</p> <p>Fundi, who had started the day on top of the jockey standings, was crowned the season’s champion after the last race. At 20, he was the youngest in a decade.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Michael Fundi with Bedford after winning the 2400m Jockey Club Stakes George Drew Challenge Series. </p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: Kenya’s former president Uhuru Kenyatta presents the champion jockey plate to Fundi. Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.</p></li> </ul> <p>“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.</p> <p>Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.</p> <p>“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.</p> <p>Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses cross the finish line.</p></li> </ul> <p>Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.</p> <p>Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.</p> <p>The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers. </p> <p>Black trainers are making their mark too.</p> <p>Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.</p></li> </ul> <p>Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.</p> <p>He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.</p> <p>A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.</p> <p>Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.</p>    <ul> <li><p>James Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.</p></li> </ul> <p>The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.</p> <p>K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.</p> <p>Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.</p> <p>During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.</p> <p>Now the situation is improving with more local participation.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Crowds in the grandstand before a race.</p></li> </ul> <p>The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.</p> <p>At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuota<strong> </strong>acknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.</p> <p>“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.</p> <p>The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.</p> <p>Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Faces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul> <p> Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.</p> <p>“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”</p> <p>The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.</p> <p>“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses gallop down the final straight in a race. </p></li> </ul> <p>The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.</p> <p>Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.</p> <p>“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>What a swell party it was. Guests feasted on half-shell oysters and champagne at Washington’s luxury Salamander Hotel. Donald Trump Jr danced to YMCA while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NujJmSMi49k\">JD Vance quipped</a>: “They don’t tell you when you run for vice-president that you get brought on stage with the Village People.”</p> <p>Guests at the $15,000-a-head <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/editorial-images/news/event/turning-point-inaugural-eve-ball-held-in-washington-d-c/776267713\">Turning Point Inaugural Eve Ball</a> last January included future FBI director Kash Patel, Jeanine Pirro and the Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor. But towering above them all, literally and figuratively, was Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and key enabler of the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Kirk, a 31-year-old rightwing activist, podcaster and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was killed on Wednesday</a> by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah. For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> <p>Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile\">grew up in an affluent suburb</a> of Chicago, the son of an architect whose firm designed the Trump Tower in New York. Rejected by the military academy at West Point, Kirk was 18 when he launched the grassroots organisation Turning Point USA in 2012, later admitting that he had “no money, no connections and no idea what I was doing”.</p> <p>Kirk’s rhetorical gift for provocative statements, inflaming cultural tensions and “owning the libs” galvanised conservative students during the Barack Obama years. He held mass rallies that drew tens of thousands of young voters each year to hear conservative leaders speaking on glitzy stages backed by ear-splitting anthems and bright pyrotechnics.</p> <p>He was the right man at the right time to pour rocket fuel on Trump’s Maga movement. In the summer of 2016 he secured a meeting at Trump Tower and gave Don Jr advice on how his father could woo young voters. Don Jr was so impressed that he instantly hired Kirk as his personal campaign assistant – or “bag boy”, as Kirk put it – as the pair took fundraising trips across the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kylespencerjournalist.com/\">Kyle Spencer</a>, a journalist and author of Raising Them Right: The Untold Story About America’s Ultraconservative Youth Movement and Its Plot for Power, said: “Don Jr didn’t think much of it until he started hanging out with Charlie and seeing how incredibly driven and ambitious he was, how skilled he was at building alliances with people of all different ages and how comfortable he was, even at a very early age, with people who had a tremendous amount of money and power. He was charming to those people but not intimidated and that was a winning combination.”</p> <p>A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/trump-kirk.html\">the New York Times reported</a>, Kirk was a guest at Don Jr’s birthday party at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump held a private conversation with him for 40 minutes.</p> <p>Spencer, who interviewed Kirk many times, continued: “Trump took a liking to him and that was very genuine. As much as Trump can have a relationship with someone and a fondness for them, he always had a real fondness for Charlie, and part of it was because he and Charlie are very similar.</p> <p>“Charlie had a kind of charismatic infectiousness and ability to draw certain people in a very similar way that Trump had. Charlie also had a real understanding of being at the forefront of media communication methods and that you always had to be a little bit ahead of the curve. Trump understood that too, which is why both of them were so comfortable building followings and communicating online and creating, in Charlie’s case, a lot of online assets.”</p>    <p>Vance said Kirk first made contact with him through a direct message on Twitter (now X) after the future vice-president appeared on Fox News in 2017. They became fast friends. Kirk was one of the first people Vance called when he thought of running for the Senate in early 2021, Vance said. Kirk introduced him to people who eventually ran his campaign – and to Don Jr.</p> <p>Vance, whom Kirk had championed as a potential running mate for Trump, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1965985360606888182\">tweeted this week</a>: “Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind. Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/black-students-colleges-racist-threats\">Black students and colleges across US targeted with racist threats day after Charlie Kirk killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By his own estimate, Kirk visited the White House more than a hundred times during Trump’s first term. In 2020, he published the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAGA-Doctrine-Only-Ideas-Future/dp/1094116238\">The Maga Doctrine</a>, a bestselling book that argued in favour of Christian nationalism and the “America First” agenda.</p> <p>He pushed conspiracy theories popular among white nationalists, including the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/cpac-republicans-democrats-america-trump-biden\"> false claim that the 2020 election was rigged</a> in favour of Joe Biden. His Turning Point Action group sponsored buses to take supporters to Washington ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on 6 January 2021, though Kirk himself did not attend. Two people connected to Turning Point Action, including its chief operating officer, served as fake electors in Arizona as part of Trump’s plot to steal the election.</p> <p>Kirk stuck by Trump during the wilderness years, in which the former president battled four criminal cases, and helped plot his improbable comeback. Turning Point Action was instrumental in driving youth support in last year’s election and was credited by Trump’s campaign for helping deliver the battleground state of Arizona.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/24/steve-bannon-war-room-republican\">Steve Bannon</a>, a godfather of the Maga movement, said by phone from Utah: “People underappreciated this: he changed the ground game. This ballot-chasing initiative was absolutely fundamental to winning in 2024. It will be fundamental going forward. What he did with young people is extraordinary.”</p> <p>Then Kirk played an outsized role in the presidential transition, advising Trump on his staff picks. Bannon, whose War Room podcast was followed by <a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/playlists/show/the-charlie-kirk-show/\">The Charlie Kirk Show</a> each day on the Real America’s Voice platform, said: “In the transition, Charlie basically moved to Mar-a-Lago. He was a central part of the transition.</p> <p>“He was, with Sergio Gor [director of the White House presidential personnel office], doing all the vetting and in a ton of meetings. He was so busy he skipped the show a bunch; I bet you Charlie only did a third of the shows during the Mar-a-Lago transition period. That’s how involved he was in the transition. The president liked having him around and he delivered.”</p> <p>Kirk supported the controversial nomination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/pete-hegseth-what-we-know\">Pete Hegseth</a>, a former Fox News host, as defence secretary. He also made the case for Turning Point USA allies to get government jobs. Bannon believes that Kirk’s “imprint” is felt in the defence, health, homeland security and other government departments.</p> <p>“Folks he didn’t know, he would do vettings. If he had a candidate or somebody he wanted to push, maybe not for a top level job but for second or third tier where the action is, people would go to Charlie. He had very active role and that continued. He spent a lot of time in Washington in the first couple months of the administration.”</p> <p>In January, Kirk travelled to Greenland with Don Jr to promote Trump’s declared ambition to acquire the Arctic territory. More recently he returned to Phoenix, Arizona, to work on Turning Point and prepare for next year’s midterm elections, Bannon added.</p> <p>“If Charlie had wanted a senior position in the government, it was there for the taking. He could have asked for virtually anything – maybe not a cabinet-level position but in a super-important position, either in the White House staff or in any of the department – and Charlie would have gotten what he wanted.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kirk remained in ideological lockstep with Trump and his inner circle, often echoing, amplifying and seeking to normalise their brazen displays of sexism, racism and Islamophobia. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wl3UwsNZ544?si=Y9yn_XXjc4bmQek7\" title=\"\">questioned the qualifications</a> of Black airline pilots, just as Trump had done during an attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p> <p>Jared Holt, a researcher at <a href=\"https://openmeasures.io/\" title=\"\">Open Measures</a>, a company that monitors influence operations online, said: “Kirk was a reliable propagandist who worked to sanitize the most alarming aspects of Trump’s movement. He relentlessly attacked Trump’s critics and demonized his scapegoats – immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities, to name a few.”</p> <p>There have been moments during Trump’s second term when Kirk was reportedly uncomfortable with the president’s decision to bomb Iran and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-response-epstein-files\">refusal to release files</a> on the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. But he was careful to avoid direct criticism of the man who was both political mentor and soulmate.</p> <p>After Kirk’s death this week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” The president ordered flags flown at half-mast and announced he would posthumously award Kirk the Medal of Freedom. Vance escorted Kirk’s body home to Phoenix on Air Force Two.</p> <p>His place in Maga mythology is assured, as his political legacy. <a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There are Turning Point people in the Trump administration and they are directly there because of Kirk’s influence. Charlie Kirk was talking about building a sustainable Maga movement. They’re playing for tomorrow. A lot of people are playing for today.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Watchdog says there are also allegations of discriminatory and misogynistic comments, centring on Charing Cross police station </p>",
    "content": "<p>Nine Scotland Yard officers have been suspended after an investigation was launched into claims of excessive use of force and the making of discriminatory and misogynistic comments.</p> \n<p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the allegations centre on Charing Cross police station in central London, the source of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/met-officers-joked-raping-women-police-watchdog-racist\">previous scandal</a> for the Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>The new investigation concerns 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the station. They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.</p> \n<p>The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”</p> \n<p>The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.</p> \n<p>The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.</p> \n<p>An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.</p> \n<p>The Met’s handling of the scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/met-officer-was-promoted-despite-misconduct-over-sexist-and-racist-messages\">with one officer being promoted</a>, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/commissioner-vows-to-clean-up-met-as-force-faces-biggest-crisis-since-1970s\">transform the culture</a> of Britain’s biggest police force.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/stephen-lawrence-mother-doreen-plea-witnesses-review\">Stephen Lawrence’s mother makes plea for witnesses as review begins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.</p> \n<p>The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.</p> \n<p>“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”</p> \n<p>The Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said: “The behaviour as reported is disgraceful and nine officers were suspended within 24 hours of the allegations being assessed and another two officers have been removed from frontline duties.</p> \n<p>“We are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by professional standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings. The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”</p> \n<p>Twist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”</p> \n<p>The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.</p> \n<p>“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>The drugmaker AstraZeneca has paused a planned £200m expansion of its Cambridge research site, completing a depressing week for the UK pharmaceutical industry.</p> \n<p>The decision by the UK’s largest company means none of its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/astrazeneca-plans-650-million-investment-in-uk\">much-trumpeted £650m investment package in the UK</a> – which was originally announced in March 2024 – is proceeding.</p> \n<p>The now stalled £200m Cambridge project had been expected to create 1,000 jobs. In January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facility</a> in Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.</p> \n<p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”</p> \n<p>The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/astrazeneca-invest-us-trump-tariff-threats\">would invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030</a>, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.</p> \n<p>The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.</p> \n<p>The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country into <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapped a £1bn London research centre</a> as well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.</p> \n<p>Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.</p> \n<p>A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">other big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investing</a> in the UK.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> \n<p>Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">told the Guardian</a> Britain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.</p> \n<p>Sanofi said: “Any substantial inward investment into the UK is currently on pause until we see tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive.”</p> \n<p>Also this week, Eli Lilly, a US drugmaker, said its planned London gateway lab, an incubator space for new drugs that brings together researchers, part of a £279m investment, was on hold.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceutical industry has long argued that the UK needs to spend more on new medicines, bringing the NHS’s outlay on medications more in line with other countries.</p> \n<p>A row between the sector and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, intensified after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">long-running NHS pricing negotiations broke down without an agreement </a>in late August. Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.</p> \n<p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/13/hundreds-baltic-tracking-russia-shadow-fleet-oil-tankers",
    "description": "<p>The Guardian joins the Swedish coastguard to patrol an area that has become a hybrid warfare battleground </p>",
    "content": "<p>In front of a bank of screens on the boat’s bridge, the Swedish<strong> </strong>coastguard Jan Erik Antonsson shows on a live map on a laptop how many vessels of Russia’s “shadow fleet” there are in the area. “These green symbols are the shadow fleet,” he says. More than a dozen green triangles representing shadow fleet vessels pop up around the coastline of southern Sweden alone. </p> \n<p>Every day hundreds of shadow fleet ships – unregulated ageing tankers from around the world in varying states of repair carrying oil from Russia to states including China and India – are moving through a relatively narrow passage in the Baltic.</p> \n<p>What was previously hoped would effectively become “Nato lake” after Finland and Sweden joined Nato, has instead become a battleground for hybrid warfare and the shadow fleet, which move under various identities and change flags to circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Some shadow ships are understood to be accompanied by Russian military vessels, others have planes following their route from above to make sure they get to their intended destination.</p> \n<p>The Guardian was given rare access to the coastguard’s operations, accompanying KBV 003 from the port of Karlskrona on an eight-hour patrol of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.</p> \n<p>“Sea traffic in the Baltic has increased somewhat copiously with the whole shadow fleet, but also with Nato ships, defence ships and the coastguard,” says the vessel’s captain, Joakim Håkansson. “So we try to get far out and show that we’re here.” </p> \n<p>In the Bornholm strait, where shipping traffic is divided like a motorway, shadow fleet vessels pass less than 10 nautical miles off the coast of Sweden. In our vicinity<strong> </strong>off the rocky Blekinge archipelago<strong>,</strong> there are two.</p> \n<p>Later the coastguard follows one, an oil tanker currently flagged in Malta that according to online maritime records has in the last two years also<strong> </strong>been flagged in the Marshall Islands under a different name. As long as vessels are in a country’s economic zone as opposed to its smaller territorial sea – at most 12 nautical miles offshore – the grounds for intervention are extremely limited, but as of July, the coastguard is allowed to contact the vessel to request information about the ship and its insurance. A crew member on the oil tanker says over the radio its last port of call was Primorsk, Russia, and it is carrying just under 30,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Its next stop, he says, is Aliağa in Turkey. Its end destination is impossible to know, but the Swedish coastguard is certain this ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet.</p> \n<p>The radio call is part of a new government plan aimed at tightening checks on the shadow fleet amid fears of a serious oil spill. The vessels are under no obligation to respond, but so far the coastguard says ships have been cooperative.</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of [shadow] ships moving in the Baltic all the time. And it’s a lot for our little sea here,” says Håkansson. “We see ships that have never been seen in the Baltic before that we come across now.” They need to build a picture of how seaworthy the ships are, he says, “because if there was an oil accident with these ships there would be an oil catastrophe in the Baltic”.</p> \n<p>Security in the Baltic has changed dramatically since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says Håkansson. As well as the growing shadow fleet, there is increasing disturbance to satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS, and Baltic authorities must keep a close eye on undersea infrastructure. In the event of an oil spill, the coastguard would be responsible for emergency response and clean-up. There is also a growing physical threat from the Russian military, as its presence has “stepped up” in the Baltic, says Håkansson.</p> \n<p>Håkansson also comes across ships he strongly suspects of spying. “Before they had these research ships [for spying]. Lately they have been using cargo ships to do these operations,” he claims. </p> \n<p>But unless there is evidence of an environmental crime, a fishing crime or some sea traffic crimes, the Swedish coastguard’s ability to act on such threats is extremely limited. According to the rules of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that deals with safety and security of shipping, “the shadow fleet is allowed to move freely in the whole of the Baltics”, says Jonatan Tholin, a preliminary investigation manager for the Swedish coastguard.</p> \n<p>National law can only apply in a country’s territorial waters, in the country’s broader economic zone it is the legislation of the country that the flag is shipped in that counts.</p> \n<p>The problems caused by the shadow fleet are exemplified by Eagle S, an oil tanker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/finland-accuses-tanker-crew-sabotage-undersea-cables-anchor\">suspected of damaging five undersea cables</a> by dragging its anchor between Finland and Estonia in December 2024. Finnish authorities filed charges against members of the crew, arguing that although the measures were carried out outside Finland, the effects of the crime materialised in Finland, meaning it falls into its jurisdiction. The crew members deny the charges.</p> \n<p>However, Tholin believes the most dangerous risk of the shadow fleet is its uninsured vessels, which in the event of an oil spill could have huge financial and environmental costs. “It means it will be taxpayer, the state, who pays,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>It was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.</p> <p>As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jun/21/electric-vehicles-carsick\">Research has shown</a> this is an issue – people who did not usually have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">motion sickness</a> in a conventional car found that they did in EVs.</p> <p>For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.</p> <p>“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.</p> <p>Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.</p> <p>The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22674\">Research carried out in China</a>, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.</p> <p>Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@atiahchayne/video/7531869808762146070\">posted on TikTok</a> about her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.</p> <p>Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”</p> <p>John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.</p> <p>While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.</p> <p>He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014193822500232X\">such as vibrations in the car seat</a> that warn the passenger when the car is turning.</p> <p>Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.</p>    <h2>How to cope with motion sickness</h2> <p>Experts and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/motion-sickness/\">the NHS suggest</a> behavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.</p> <p><strong>Sit at the front</strong> Knowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.</p> <p><strong>Try motion sickness medications</strong> These come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be taken <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html#:~:text=most%20effective%20when%20taken%20before%20exposure\">before travelling</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wear </strong><strong>ac</strong><strong>upressure</strong><strong> bands </strong>These are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,<em>” </em>Golding says.</p> <p><strong>Listen to a 100hz sound</strong> for a minute. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11955832/\">Research</a> from Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/13/obsessive-collectors-pay-big-money-personalised-number-plates",
    "description": "<p>Customised plates often cost more than the car – and yet the number of people queueing up to buy them is at an all‑time high. What’s the appeal?</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.</p> <p>Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a&nbsp;world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit. The question is: why?</p> <p>John Harrison, 75, is known as the “modern godfather” of autonumerology – the hobby of being enormously into registration plates. He tells me over the phone: “You’ve got people who are mainly interested in what I’d call the pattern of numbers, the more technical side; people interested in personal numbers; people interested in foreign plates. I do a bit of all three.” As a&nbsp;child, like many number-plate fans, he scribbled down the ones he saw on the road and started looking up some of their details. He tracked the work of the late Noel&nbsp;Woodall, the hobby’s true OG, who wrote 24 – yes, 24 – books about registration plates. (One of them is called Where’s It From? When Was It Issued?) Harrison has limited himself to just the one title: The Number Plate Book.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, I meet Harrison face to face at the annual Registration Numbers Club rally at the Wythall Transport Museum in Worcestershire – the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comic-con\">Comic-Con</a> for number-plate fans. They convene there to admire one another’s wares and hand out tongue-in-cheek awards, and have done so for almost 50 years.</p>    <p>I also meet Neal Bircher, who might be more interested in number plates than anyone else on the face of the Earth. He is my introduction to the world of Facebook groups for plate fans, and I join one called Private Number Plate Enthusiasts, which is like a&nbsp;birdspotting group for number-plate devotees. Bircher’s car boasts “NEA 1”, and over the years he has owned various iterations of his initials, “NAB”. He also owns “149 PCE”, the number plate on the truck at the heart of Steven Spielberg’s first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/13/duel-at-50-steven-spielberg-debut-thriller\">Duel</a>. He still yearns for “NB1” or “NA1”, or perhaps “A1”, which enthusiasts tend to consider the great white whale of the plate world. “A1” is perhaps the only plate with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_registration_plate\">own Wikipedia page</a>. It is owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, and would sell for multiple millions.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple millions, at the rally I also meet Richard Conway. I know about Conway because I have heard he is selling the “1 HRH” plate on his Bentley for £2.5m. (He doesn’t throw in the Bentley for that price.) It is a valuation that raises eyebrows everywhere I mention it. “Too much,” Harrison says. “If you’re a&nbsp;multimillionaire, two-and-a-half may be peanuts, but to me it sounds, shall we say, somewhat ambitious.”</p> <p>Angela Banh is marketing manager for Regtransfers, which, as the biggest number-plate broker in the country, advertises some plates for millions of pounds. “F1”, which belongs to car entrepreneur Afzal Kahn, was&nbsp;listed on the website until recently and he expects £15m for it. Does she think “1 HRH” is worth £2.5m? “It’s not one that we would value at that kind of figure,” Banh says. “But that doesn’t mean someone’s not going to pay two-and-a-half for it.”</p>    <p>Conway, 50, is an entrepreneur who also owns the Number Plate Company Group Limited. He won’t tell me how much he paid for “1 HRH”, of course, but in 2009 it changed hands at a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) auction for £92,000 plus VAT and fees. He bought it 13 years later, but hadn’t intended on selling it. Like various other enthusiasts, he likens the hobby to collecting expensive paintings. “I might think: ‘What an idiot. They’ve spent £3m on that piece of art.’ But that’s because I don’t understand the market.” He tells me he has already turned down seven-figure offers. What if King Charles tapped him on the shoulder? “I&nbsp;think that’s unlikely,” he smiles. The reverse plate – “HRH 1”, which those in the business consider the “right” way around because the letters come first – was given to Queen Elizabeth II as an engagement present by the original owner. Conway doesn’t seem likely to give his up for free.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Back in Chichester, the price of lot 56 is still rising: £300,000, £310,000, £320,000. The number plate in question is “JB 1”, once the property of Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealer John&nbsp;Barclay. Why is the plate so valuable? Because “JB” has a good claim to being the most common set of initials in the country. (To help them come to an accurate valuation, Regtransfers has a database of names and surnames.) “330,” says the auctioneer. “340 … ” One of the bidders in the room is John Doherty, buy-in manager for Regtransfers, sitting with Banh. He has just bid £350,000. There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people.</p> <p>In 2019, when the DVLA surveyed drivers with an interest in private number plates, they found that 6% wanted them for their business; 17% considered them an investment; and 69% bought them because of a&nbsp;personal connection. The perception of people who go in for personalised number plates isn’t famously positive. Of&nbsp;course, hardcore hobbyists demur, making the point that being really into number plates doesn’t <em>necessarily </em>make you an overcompensating flash prat. “It’s not about ‘Me, me, me – look at me,’” Bircher says. “It’s ‘I find this interesting.’ I say to people, ‘What on earth is showy about the squiggles on the plate on the front of your car?’”</p> <p>One noticeable thing about the enthusiasts is that they tend to be older, white and male. But bucking one of those trends is 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/numberplatehistory/?hl=en\">Kit Joubert</a>, who is making a splash on Instagram with an account devoted to exploring the history of number plates. He presents slick videos in which he discusses notorious plates, always with access to the cars they are on. Joubert thinks that over the last couple of decades the public perception has changed significantly, to the point that a personalised number plate is now simply another part of car customisation. “There’s a shift beginning to happen,” he says, “and I, for better or worse, might be the face of that, at least on social media.” Because there is often an overlap between fast cars and lucrative number plates, the hobby is well suited to visual platforms such as Instagram. Joubert recently organised a meet-up for plate enthusiasts, which he claims was the first to happen without the involvement of the Registration Numbers Club. He wants to make number plates his full-time job in the next year. “It’s changed my life,” he says.</p>    <p>Number plates were introduced to British roads under the 1903 Motor Car Act and, as Harrison explains in his book, at first they were one or two letters (denoting an area of the country), followed by up to four numbers. Harrison believes the first to have been a Hastings plate, “DY 1”. (The letters correlated to the size of the local authority. London, the largest, had “A”. Once the end of the alphabet was reached, “AA” took effect.) After the numbers were used up, letters were added before the two initials. Then, in the 1950s, the reversed format was phased in: “1234 AB”. In the 60s, letters were added to the end, with the “A” suffix in “AMP 595A” denoting 1963, for example. From the 1980s things got increasingly convoluted – one of the many reasons that people yearn for the beautiful simplicity of those early plates.</p> <p>Another explanation for the popularity of plates today is that the DVLA has cottoned on to how much of a cash cow the hobby is. In 1977 the government was plotting to make the transfer of plates more expensive and difficult. “No one could make a convincing claim that he would suffer genuine hardship if he could no longer afford to transfer his cherished mark or his personalised number plate,” <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1977-01-24/debates/0fec342e-5409-4742-8b16-fa86f457252a/RoadVehicles(RegistrationMarkTransfers)\">said the MP John Horam</a>. The Registration Numbers Club formed in opposition to this philosophy, and ultimately won the fight. Now, the DVLA would never seek to make the process more difficult: the DVLA’s head of external communications points me to an <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687e00805f0f5104b9806beb/DVLA_annual_report_and_accounts_2024_to_2025.pdf\">annual report</a> that says in 2024-25 they made more than £274m from personalised number plates. (The organisation charges an £80 fee for every plate sold.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if ‘OAS 1S’ might go for a silly amount. The DVLA are no fools when it comes to the timing of their release</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The DVLA held its first auction in 1989. Initially, it&nbsp;simply sold plates that had already been issued. Over time, however, it has become possible to request&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific plate be created and auctioned. If it is valid and unreleased, it could be yours. Once upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, all of the DVLA’s auctions were in-person, but when attendance fell during the pandemic, it moved&nbsp;them all to its website. In June, I register to check one out.</p> <p>I am interested in this specific auction because I want to know if “OAS 1S” might go for a silly amount of money. (The DVLA is no fool when it comes to the timing of its releases.) Also up for grabs is “95 A”, which Bircher tells me is the first three-character plate to be auctioned in five years. As I watch, I can see the prices rise in real time. At the end of the five-day auction, “OAS 1S” is at £56,040; “95 A” has secured £71,010; but the winner is “8 FU”, which has sold for £90,000. Harrison’s insight is that “Fu” is a common surname in China, where the number eight is also considered lucky.</p>    <p>“FU” brings us to another subject: <a href=\"https://www.regtransfers.co.uk/content/hundreds-2025-plates-banned\">naughty plates</a>. Banh tells me that until 2024, “FU” was suppressed (because of its “fuck you” connotations). As Harrison says in his book, censorship has been a concern since the very beginning. “DD” was originally considered too problematic to have on a car because the initials stood for “drop dead”. When local authorities were allocated two-letter prefixes, Dorset were disgruntled with “BF” because it was considered to stand for “bloody fool”; “666” used to be deemed too offensive for sensitive eyes. “They go around in circles,” Banh says. “What was considered rude many years ago is no longer rude now.” Currently you can have a “PEN 15” but you can’t have an “AR25 HOL”.</p> <p>At the rally I meet Matthew Edwards, 56, who is selling his “S69 CUM” plate for £15,000. (His wife no longer finds it funny.) For a while he also had “K21 KKK” – until the DVLA decided “KKK” was too offensive to be allowed on the road. He had bought it purely to sell it, but that became all but impossible. “I couldn’t give it away,” he says.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in Chichester, “JB 1” has broken the £400,000 barrier. Everyone but Doherty and a&nbsp;mysterious bidder on the phone has dropped out. The bidding goes up to £410,000, then £420,000, then £430,000. When it creeps up to £500,000, an audible murmur goes around the room. The record is within touching distance.</p> <p>“Is it any different from adorning your car with anything else – to having a special paint job, or having some bolt-on goodie? I don’t know,” says Nicholas Young, 76, as I sit in his Rolls-Royce (number plate “NY 1”). Young, whose fascination lies in the history of number plates, concedes that it is “childish and stupid” to buy plates because they match your initials. He also admits that’s exactly what he’s done.</p> <p>Young has also written his own book – the colossal Car Number Classics (“I was impressed not only by its weight, but certainly more by its contents!” one of the reviewers said) – and he has no interest in treating the plates as a way to get rich. “If I say I christened my son after a number plate, that really does sound sad,” he says, “but his name is the same as mine. So they’ll go to him.”</p>    <p>In Chichester, the anonymous bidder on the phone is head-to-head with Doherty. They’re at £500,000. “510,” the auctioneer says. He looks at Doherty, who nods. “520,” he says. With that, it has broken the UK record. Joubert, who is standing feet away from me, is well aware of this. “530,” the auctioneer says, taking a bid from the phone. There is a silence. “530,” he repeats, looking at Doherty. He shakes his head. As the auctioneer raises his hammer, fireworks crash somewhere above our heads. “530,000,” he says, banging his hammer. The room breaks out into applause. It is an astonishing turn of events. With the addition of fees and VAT, “JB&nbsp;1” has sold for £608,600. Is it simply three squiggles on a&nbsp;sheet of metal? Or is it a priceless piece of history? As&nbsp;Edwards says: “You either get it or you don’t.”</p> <p>Who is the mysterious new owner of “JB 1”? Weeks later, I hear back from the auctioneer who had the bidder on the other end of the phone. I wanted to know if they might be willing to speak to me. “I spoke to the buyer,” he says. Yes? “And I can confirm they would like to remain anonymous.” Damn. “However, they are fine to say that they have the initials JB.” Justin&nbsp;Bieber? Joe&nbsp;Biden? Jeff&nbsp;Bezos? Jack Black? James Blunt? Juliette Binoche, perhaps? I have chosen to believe it was Jim&nbsp;Broadbent. But we may never know. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The American dream has never looked more seductive, with long and loose summer wardrobes and beachy jewellery</p>",
    "content": "<p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p> <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p> <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p> <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this New York fashion week, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p> <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p> <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p> <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before New York fashion week began.</p> <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p> <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>  ",

They moved in a tight, repeated loop, and on this day the light was soft and just right to capture their movement clearly,” he says. He&nbsp;utilised his phone camera’s slo-mo mode “to create a visual that almost feels like it was drawn with light. Their flight formed a fluid, layered pattern, like an&nbsp;S-shaped ribbon floating in space.”</p> <p>Chavali immediately knew he’d captured something special, converting the photo to&nbsp;black and white to remove distractions and&nbsp;emphasise texture. He&nbsp;notes a “kind of visual poetry and a&nbsp;reminder that wonder can be found in quiet, overlooked places. These birds have adapted to concrete spaces we have built over their habitats, yet&nbsp;they continue to move through the city with elegance and ease.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A jar of gherkins reminds me of the sea around the British Isles – murky, seaweed-green and mysterious – and of that bizarre marine animal, the sea cucumber (though sea gherkin would perhaps be more accurate, given how similar some species look). Gherkins also happen to be one of my favourite foods, though I usually eat them straight from the jar and rarely save any for all those recipes that benefit from their addition, from potato salads to bloody marys.</p> <p>I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p> <p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed? </p> <p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

The Emmys are back, more or less kicking off the Hollywood award season with a healthy mix of Emmy stalwarts and beloved newbies. Will voters choose between the head (Severance, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/15/emmy-nominations-2025\">leading 27 noms</a>) or the heart (The Pitt) for best drama?

Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/business/media/severance-the-pitt-emmys.html\">current state of the television business</a>. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Severance</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Andor</p> <h2><strong>Best comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Abbott Elementary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/26/the-bear-season-four-review-finally-becoming-the-show-it-was-always-destined-to-be\">The Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/11/hacks-season-four-review-the-return-of-this-extremely-funny-hugely-raw-comedy-is-a-sheer-pleasure\">Hacks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/27/only-murders-in-the-building-season-four-review-by-far-the-funniest-thing-on-tv\">Only Murders in the Building</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/shrinking-season-two-review-harrison-ford-comedy-apple-tv\">Shrinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/26/the-studio-review-seth-rogens-hollywood-satire-is-fast-furious-and-beautifully-fun\">The Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny\">What We Do in the Shadows</a></p> <p>Another interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Studio</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Hacks</p> <h2><strong>Best limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/17/adolescence-netflix-powerful-tv-could-save-lives\">Adolescence</a>, Black Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv\">Dying for Sex</a>, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Penguin</p> <p>Of all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/09/france-netflix-uk-drama-adolescence-teach-toxic-masculinity-schools\">fixture in secondary school programs</a> across Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">thematic lightning rod</a>, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a drama series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pedro-pascal\">Pedro Pascal</a> (The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)</p> <p>It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)</p> <p>Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)</p> <p>If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into the Emmys with 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Seth Rogen</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adam Brody</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a comedy series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)</p> <p>Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win. Smart has won thrice previously for her late career-defining role as the brittle, brassy comedian Deborah Vance. There’s no reason why she shouldn’t continue her streak for Hacks’ fourth season, for her portrait of just how awful it can be – how vengeful, vicious and wounded one can become – when they get everything they wanted.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence), Jake Gyllenhaal (Presumed Innocent), Brian Tyree Henry (Dope Thief), Cooper Koch (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story)</p> <p>This one is a toss-up, with strong performances across the board, and it’s nice to see the always excellent Brian Tyree Henry get a nod for Dope Thief, one of many Apple TV series that, like Gyllenhaal’s Presumed Innocent, disappear into the streaming ether soon after release. Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario. But Colin Farrell, who won the Golden Globe and SAG awards earlier this year for his full vanity disappearance in The Penguin, may have the edge here.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Colin Farrell</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Stephen Graham</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Cate Blanchett (Disclaimer), Meghann Fahy (Sirens), Rashida Jones (Black Mirror), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin), Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)</p> <p>Look, Cate Blanchett is, indisputably, one of the best actors of her generation, but the muddled Apple TV show Disclaimer is not a worthy showcase of her talents. In a similar vein, I want awards for Meghann Fahy, who was the deceptively nuanced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/13/white-lotus-daphne-sullivan-character-meghann-fahy\">true star of the White Lotus’s second season</a>, but Netflix’s Sirens was outright bad, and her performance in it iffy. Cristin Milioti is delivering career-best work in the Penguin, but voter preference will skew toward the perennially nominated Michelle Williams, whose performance in Dying for Sex is up to her very high standards – spiky, layered, vulnerable and totally convincing.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <h2><strong>Scripted variety series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a></p> <p>I maintain that it is not fair to pit the thoroughly researched, impeccably delivered deep dives of Last Week Tonight against the deliberately loose sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live. I also maintain that Last Week Tonight is a singular television program whose constant drive to be better, to cut through bullshit, to be more empathetic and reasonable, deserves a 10th consecutive Emmy.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Last Week Tonight</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Last Week Tonight</p> <h2><strong>Talk series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>The Daily Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a></p> <p>As someone who watches every late-night monologue every morning for work, I personally think the Daily Show – Jon Stewart plus a rotating cast of five correspondent-hosts (Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Michael Kosta, Ronny Chieng and Josh Johnson) – is doing the best work at processing the day’s headlines in a way that is both informative and funny, with the appropriate amount of seriousness and cynicism. But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>The Daily Show</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)</p> <p>Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast. Tillman deserves for his unnerving and unforgettable performance as a corporate henchman, but I bet voters prefer Goggins’s especially miserable tourist.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Walton Goggins</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Tramell Tillman</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Patricia Arquette (Severance), Carrie Coon (The White Lotus), Katherine LaNasa (The Pitt), Julianne Nicholson (Paradise), Parker Posey (The White Lotus), Natasha Rothwell (The White Lotus), Aimee Lou Wood (The White Lotus)</p> <p>Another, more exciting White Lotus-off! I would’ve liked to see Leslie Bibb nominated as well for her pitch-perfect portrayal of a secret Texas Republican, or for Katherine LaNasa to get more attention for her radiant calm on the Pitt. But this is a heavyweight supporting category between Aimee Lou Wood’s deceptively difficult work, Parker Posey’s North Carolina accent and Carrie Coon’s magnificent portrayal of feral love and jealousy in a friend triangle.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Carrie Coon</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Aimee Lou Wood</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong><strong> </strong>Ike Barinholtz (The Studio), Colman Domingo (The Four Seasons), Harrison Ford (Shrinking), Jeff Hiller (Somebody Somewhere), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Michael Urie (Shrinking), Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live)</p> <p>The recognition of Jeff Hiller’s heartfelt and genuinely funny work on the under-sung Somebody Somewhere is a classic case of the nomination is the win. There’s a lot of love for Ike Barinholtz’s physical comedy as a coke-addled exec in The Studio, and residual affection for Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s beloved Cousin Richie on the Bear, but it’s hard to beat the narrative of national treasure Harrison Ford getting his first Emmy nomination at age 83.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Harrison Ford</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Jeff Hiller</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actress in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong><strong> </strong>Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Kathryn Hahn (The Studio), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Catherine O’Hara (The Studio), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary), Jessica Williams (Shrinking)</p> <p>The Bear’s Liza Colón-Zayas won last year, likely because her standout episode in the Bear’s third season, Napkins, aired in June and was fresh in Emmy voters minds. Because of Emmy timing, she’s up for that deserving episode now, but the tide has shifted against the Bear. Hannah Einbinder has yet to win for her yin to Jean Smart’s yang on Hacks, and this is her year.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Hannah Einbinder</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Liza Colón-Zayas</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Javier Bardem (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), Bill Camp (Presumed Innocent), Owen Cooper (Adolescence), Rob Delaney (Dying For Sex), Peter Sarsgaard (Presumed Innocent), Ashley Walters (Adolescence)</p> <p>This is another tight lock – the power of Adolescence as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">“wake-up call”</a> on the influence of online misogyny on young boys does not work if the actor playing the boy doesn’t invoke both revulsion and empathy.

    "content": "<h2>Why Terence Crawford will beat Canelo Álvarez</h2> \n<p>For years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/terence-crawford\">Bud Crawford</a>’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so complete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/30/terence-crawford-after-spence-win-im-pound-for-pound-no-1-without-a-doubt\">it cemented his place</a> in boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/terence-crawford-profile-canelo-alvarez-fight\">Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a5ca207-01c6-4e22-8a75-8e43030f4b13\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\"><b>Canelo v Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's happening?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where and when is the fight?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators.

Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\">Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.</p> \n<p>Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-how-boxing-won-the-lottery-but-lost-the-ticket-again\">present company included</a>. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.</p> \n<p>The weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.</p> \n<p>The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Why Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence Crawford</h2> \n<p>Next month it will be 20 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez\">Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez</a> made his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.</p> \n<p>Years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/saul-canelo-alvarez-i-want-to-keep-fighting-my-whole-life-i-so-enjoy-it\">he confided</a> that “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”</p> \n<p>Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The great Terence Crawford is, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/alvarez-and-crawford-face-off-in-breathless-blockbuster-destined-to-break-records\">Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break records</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-boxing-fight-arlington-texas-report-result\">sharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tyson</a> in 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.</p> \n<p>Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.</p> \n<p>Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.</p> \n<p>This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.</p> \n<p>Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/04/terence-crawford-beats-israil-madrimov-to-become-four-division-champion\">looked diminished against Israil Madrimov</a> – who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.</p> \n<p>Álvarez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/04/canelo-alvarez-terence-crawford-william-scull-fight\">looked terrible in his last fight</a>, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/11/jaron-boots-ennis-eimantas-stanionis-fight-preview\">Jaron “Boots” Ennis</a>, who would test Crawford at welterweight.</p> \n<p>Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez\">he was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013</a>, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.</p> \n<p>But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.</p> \n<p>Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Priestdaddy author on quitting social media, Maga conspiracies and how her second novel grew out of a period of post-Covid mania</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patricia-lockwood\">Patricia Lockwood</a> does whenever she spots a priest while walking through an airport. The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like: <em>I know</em>.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.</p> <p>This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-gilbert\">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> than a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.</p> <p>So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”</p> <p>All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experienced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”</p> <p>I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.</p> <p>The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”</p>    <p>As I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”</p> <p>These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked about <em>cancel culture</em>. It is my greatest fear, to be asked about <em>cancel culture</em> – or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I&nbsp;will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”</p> <p>This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very&nbsp;exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.</p> <p>Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/26/patricia-lockwood-poem-rape-joke\">Rape Joke</a>, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.</p> <p>In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born with <a href=\"https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/proteus-syndrome/\">Proteus syndrome</a>, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”</p>    <p>In the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.</p> <p>Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”</p> <p>Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”</p> <p>The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”</p> <p>On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”</p> <p><em>• Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

    "content": "<p>Is it still safe to stage the World Cup in the United States? After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.</p> <p>The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/florian-wirtz-liverpool-newcastle-nick-woltemade-gambling-philipp-lahm\">Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp Lahm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friend Donald Trump.</p> <p>Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar\">I feel like a concerned black African football tourist</a>. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.</p> <p>You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.</p> <p>But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.</p> <p>It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.</p>    <p>And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.</p> <p>This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/01/cristiano-ronaldo-faces-us1bn-lawsuit-for-promoting-binance-nfts\">collapsed into legal chaos</a>, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.</p> <p>What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.</p> <p>Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/04/us-court-to-hear-arguments-over-payment-in-cristiano-ronaldo-allegation-case\">no-admission no-guilt payoff</a> to make the whole thing stop.</p> <p>The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.</p>    <p>And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.</p> <p>Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).</p> <p>And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.</p> <p>For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.</p> <p>Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.</p> <p>He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.</p>    <p>For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.</p> <p>Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.</p> <p>What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.</p> <p>This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else.

Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the Guardian University Guide 2026. It can feel like it’s all change in universities these days – exams are increasingly a thing of the past, you can tune into lectures online, and now there’s the tricky business of working out whether ChatGPT is your studying friend or foe.</p> <p>This year’s guide will help you understand how technology is reshaping the university experience, and how to make the most of it – from landing a place on a course you love, to getting ready for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>The Guardian rankings will help you figure out which universities give their students the best experience, rather than just showing you which are strongest in academic research, like most other league tables.</p> <p>We rank universities through eight different scores, which form a total out of 100. These include what students say about their teaching and feedback in the annual National Student Survey.</p> <p>We also look at how big class sizes are through the student-to-staff ratio and how much universities spend on teaching each student. Other areas covered are students’ A-level grades and whether their academic performance improves at university (the value-added score), and how likely they are to persevere with their course. There’s also data on how many students get graduate jobs 15 months after leaving university. For each metric, we use the most recent data available at the time of publication. Any blank spaces mean there is data missing, so we focus on the other measures.</p> <p>In the guide, you will find our overall league table of UK universities as well as individual subject profiles and tables. This year, we have a special table showing you the universities and courses that graduates were least likely to regret. We’ve also got lots of advice to help you make up your mind and start planning for university, from how to take advantage of clearing to which universities offer a buzzing student nightlife.</p> <p>The rankings change annually, and some universities may benefit from temporary measures such as funding boosts or changes to their student intake. Don’t forget that universities languishing at the bottom of the overall table can be top for certain subjects – so check out our subject tables and profiles to build up a full picture.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The incoming vice-chancellor, Prof Frances Bowen, credits the student-focused approach at the University of Essex for its soaring rankings and high satisfaction rating</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/the-guardian-university-guide-2026-the-rankings\"><strong>The 2026 league table</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide\"><strong>View the full guide</strong></a></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>At the University of Essex’s open days this summer, only a few staff took particular notice of one inquisitive visitor talking to prospective students and parents – but that “mystery shopper” turned out to be Essex’s&nbsp;next vice-chancellor. Prof Frances Bowen became Essex’s senior leader in August, and took advantage of her anonymity before that to see its Colchester campus through the eyes of potential applicants and their families.</p> <p>What stood out from her undercover experience was that “the passion for the place was really clear from our students, from staff,” – as well as the more surprising perspectives of parents touring the campus.</p> <p>“Interacting with parents, many of the questions were the ones you would expect, for example, employability prospects, what the programme would be like, and what the contact hours would be,” says Prof Bowen.</p> <p>“The thing I wasn’t expecting was how much interest they would have in the overall offer, meaning the accommodation and the life on campus as a whole.</p> <p>“I’m a lifelong academic, I have attended lots and lots of open days as an academic, and from that point of view you can think it’s all about the course. But from the mystery shopper point of view, it was really clear that it was the whole package, the whole experience, that was really important.”</p> <p>This reflects Bowen’s attitude towards seeking to really understand students’ needs, which she says is a long-running feature of Essex’s “safe and sensible” approach. It was this, as well as its academic heritage, that attracted her to the job.</p> <p>Her arrival – following Prof Anthony Forster’s retirement in 2024 after 11 years as vice-chancellor – comes as Essex rises to its highest-ever position in the Guardian University Guide’s overall rankings. More than five years ago, as the Covid pandemic appeared, Essex slipped to 85th overall. But since then it has been on a steady upwards march, to 23rd position last year and up again to 12th this year.</p> <p>Bowen acknowledges that “it’s taken a decade of hard work” by the university to get there, and comes alongside the university’s highest-ever research income, meaning that she takes over at a high point for both sides of its mission.</p> <p>The Guardian University Guide analysis shows Essex has a wide array of strong undergraduate degrees, including the top national ranking for drama and dance courses. One of the new campus universities founded in the 1960s, alongside the likes of York and Warwick, Essex remains strong in social sciences such as economics and international relations, but its courses in anatomy and physiology, biology, nursing and mathematics are also ranked in the top 10 this year.</p> <p>Essex’s performance has been helped by its buoyant staff-student ratios, and its ability to get the most out of its students in value-added measures, showing that its graduates emerge with better degree results than their previous grades would suggest.</p> <p>One of the university’s greatest strengths, in Bowen’s eyes, “is the work that Essex has done, not just recently and not since it was just fashionable to do so, the really hard work in figuring out who our students are and how best to meet their needs – their actual needs, rather than what we imagine [them] to be”.</p> <p>As an example of the university’s pragmatism, Bowen explains the “Come on in” campaign run in association with Essex’s student union, designed to encourage students back into lectures and classes in person, through posters and screens.</p> <p>“Where this comes from is the basic question: why do students not come to lectures? Or, what is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that stops the student from coming on to campus? “And once you start unpacking this, one of the main reasons we discovered why students do not walk into that lecture, it’s because when they get there they don’t know anybody and they don’t have anybody to go in with. It’s often as simple as&nbsp;that.”</p> <p>The current cohort of students went through lockdowns at school, where they “maybe missed that type of social connection and confidence to walk into a room full of strangers and participate,” she says.</p> <p>“There are students who are also working part-time. They may have done an extra shift. They tried to come on the bus but the bus was late. And they get there, and the lecture has started, and they’re standing outside the lecture theatre, and the ‘Come on in’ poster is on the door saying: come on in. You are welcome even if you’re late, even if you’re on your own, just step inside,” she says.</p> <p>“There’s something very pragmatic about it, and there are lots of examples like that where I think Essex has really done a good job of getting those things right. It doesn’t matter what the ratio of staff&nbsp;to student is inside the class if you don’t even walk in.”</p> <p>The campaign appears to have been a success, with student retention rates and lecture attendance improved since the start of the messaging.</p>    <p>Originally from south Wales – and the first in her family to attend university – Bowen understands that not all students are from backgrounds familiar with the ins and outs of academic life.</p> <p>“One of the things that we have to work quite hard on is helping people understand what university actually is, rather than what they might have read in the media or imagine what it might be. We’re not some kind of, you know, traditional extended boarding school or something like that. We’re not some ivory tower. We have a lot of research excellence, but we’re not that sort of rarefied place,” she says.</p> <p>Nearly half of Essex’s students come from families where there has not been a tradition of higher education, while 18% have a disability in some form. To prepare incoming students, the university offers what it calls the Essex preparation programme.</p> <p>“It’s essentially an online learning module about how to think about coming to university. And students get a £250 bursary if they complete the course before the start of their studies. The take-up of that is really good. It costs us money but it’s worth every penny – our figures indicate students are more successful and they’re less likely to drop out if they complete the programme,” Bowen explains.</p> <p>“And it also links into all of the extra support and opportunities we offer when students arrive, because if they just arrive cold at the start of ‘welcome week’ it can be an utterly overwhelming experience.”</p> <p>Like almost every other UK university, Essex’s finances have been hit by the erosion of domestic tuition fee income and the drop-off in international students. And like many others it has endured cost-cutting and redundancies, with little hope for any immediate relief.</p> <p>The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) also threatens to upset traditional university practices but Bowen says the clock cannot be turned back: “We’re grappling with it in terms of the whole student experience, not just assessment … I think we’ve got to accept that students arriving at university today have already been using generative AI for years. So the real question is how we can adapt to that reality.</p> <p>“Employers consistently tell us that they want graduates who are curious, who can think critically and creatively, and thankfully those skills are at the very heart of higher education. But we do need to design curriculums and assessments that maintain rigour and fairness, with students using AI thoughtfully, ethically and effectively.”</p> <h2>Movers and shakers: who’s climbing high in the University Guide 2026?</h2> <p><strong>Modern movers<br></strong>Although the top 10 spots are mostly claimed by the UK’s older institutions, this year lots of modern universities have climbed up the rankings, often due to quality teaching and the good employment prospects their vocational courses offer graduates. One especially meteoric ascent belongs to the<strong> University of East London</strong>, which has continued its annual scale up the rankings, leaping this year from 56th to 33rd. Meanwhile, <strong>Southampton</strong> <strong>Solent </strong>has climbed into the top 60 for the first time in its history, and <strong>Goldsmiths</strong> has jumped from 109th to 67th – a position it has not reached since 2018.</p> <p><strong>Grateful graduates<br></strong>In our new graduate choice data, healthcare subjects are among those which recent graduates are most likely to feel glad they studied. This year, <strong>Cardiff</strong>’s general nursing course has soared from 45th to 8th out of 76 providers, and its mental health nursing course rose from 41st to 10th. Graduates of construction, surveying and planning were similarly satisfied – <strong>Derby</strong>’s course could be a good pick for prospective students, since it climbed from 37th to 5th out of 41 providers.</p> <p><strong>Engineering excellence<br></strong>There are so many different kinds of engineering course, choosing the right one for you can be daunting – so check out our subject tables to get a sense of how they differ. If you’re interested in mechanical engineering, <strong>Heriot-Watt</strong> climbed from 45th to 8th in our rankings in this year’s guide, while<strong> Leicester</strong>’s course soared from 40th to 6th. For electrical and electronic engineering,<strong> Derby</strong> rose from 38th to 6th, and <strong>Robert Gordon</strong> climbed from 33rd to 5th out of 58 providers. <strong>Derby</strong>’s civil engineering course had a similar upward trajectory: from 32nd to 5th.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The time and money you invest in education should be repaid by a rewarding career, but is that always the case? </p>",
    "content": "<p>Is a university degree still worth it? That question has been asked for decades but with increased frequency over the last 10 years, as the cost of taking a degree has shifted from government to graduates.</p> <p>The short answer is: yes it is, according to experts such as the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/impact-undergraduate-degrees-lifetime-earnings\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> (IFS). But as undergraduates in England now finish their courses with tuition and maintenance loans averaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/20/students-in-england-graduate-average-debt-increase\">£53,000</a>, the longer answer is that it’s complicated.</p> <p>Every graduate’s earnings are affected by other factors: how wealthy their family are, how well they did at school, as well as gender and ethnicity. But some factors can be changed, namely where they go to university and what course they study.</p> <p>And to make it more complicated, there are the non-financial benefits such as evidence of <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00306-7/fulltext\">longer lifespans</a> and better <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/documents/ukeo-does-studying-an-undergraduate-degree-make-you-wealthier-and-happier.pdf\">personal wellbeing</a> than for non-graduates.</p> <p>Prof Bobby Duffy, director of King’s College London’s policy institute, says: “There is still a <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/field/downloads/2024-05/UUK-graduate-employment-outcomes-analysis.pdf\">graduate premium</a> that is somewhere on average between £200,000 to £400,000 in lifetime earnings, depending on a lot of things.</p> <p>“It’s a complex area, there’s lots of variation within courses. But on average you still earn more over your lifetime than the costs of going to university and the lost earnings [while studying]. That’s the pure financial case.</p> <p>“There’s also all the work that’s been done on the&nbsp;personal benefits and societal benefits of university. There’s substantial evidence of independent benefits on skills development, self-esteem, sense of wellbeing, civic engagement and openness to diversity. And then there are ultimately benefits to health and longevity that are not explained by other things but are explained by university attendance. And that leads to benefits to&nbsp;society.”</p> <p>But Duffy points out that the financial element of the graduate premium has declined over time. That shouldn’t come as a surprise. At the start of the 1960s only about 4% of school leavers entered higher education, rising to nearer 14% by the end of the 1970s.</p> <p>Fifty years later, more than one in three students go directly into higher education from school, and they are joined by more of their peers in the years that follow, so that Tony Blair’s aim of 50% of young people experiencing higher education by the age of 30 has been achieved.</p> <p>Andy Westwood, professor of public policy at the University of Manchester and a director of the Productivity Institute, says: “Inevitably with that growth you’ve seen a diversification in the types of institutions and experiences, and their [financial] returns. It’s not as if every option is going to work for everybody but a lot of options will.”</p> <p>New graduate choice data supplied to the Guardian by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) shows wide variations in terms of university and course satisfaction, in surveys taken after entering the workforce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/x8BNV/1/\" data-alt=\"Student satisfaction graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/x8BNV/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Those who graduated in 2023 in medicine and health sciences courses, including dentistry and midwifery, were the most satisfied with their choice of course, followed by architecture, computer science and construction courses. All of the top 10 are degrees with a vocational component that offer good employment prospects. Those who studied journalism, marketing or social work were the most likely to regret their choices.</p> <p>Graduates of Oxford were most satisfied with their choice of institution – but in second place comes the University of Sheffield, which was more&nbsp;popular among its graduates than some other universities that come higher in the Guardian’s overall rankings, such as Cambridge or the London School of Economics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kb30o/1/\" data-alt=\"Education establishment satisfaction chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kb30o/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Tony Blair’s assumption was that funding more people to go to university would itself create higher growth. But the UK’s regional inequalities and 15 years of flat or low wage growth have proved it wrong. “Universities and their graduates are not going to be immune from those wider problems,” Westwood says.</p> <p>He argues that the current system places a lot of power into the hands of 17- and 18-year-olds, and their families, to choose from a wide variety of courses, some of which offer attractive careers with high pay and some of which don’t, sometimes from the same university.</p> <p>Economics degrees typically offer some of the highest <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.kernohan/viz/LEO202223byprovider/Dashboard2\">pay for recent graduates</a> but especially for those from select universities, with graduates of Cambridge, the LSE and University College London at the peak.</p> <p>The top seven universities see their economics graduates paid more than £60,000 five years after graduation. But the bottom seven institutions show earnings of £35,000 or less. </p> <p>Even a good degree in English from a UK university only leads to average salaries of £33,000 five years after graduation. But those averages can conceal further variations affected by gender and family background, with the value of a degree based on what non-graduate peers with the same exam grades earn.</p> <p>Research by the IFS revealed a paradox, that those with the lowest graduate earnings also received the largest boost to their earnings from attending university, such as students from the most deprived backgrounds. “The reason is that the earnings prospects of these groups are very low on average if they do not attend university,” the IFS&nbsp;says.</p> <p>But it is the graduate’s own decisions about career paths that have a major influence over what they earn. Rachel Beauchamp, an employability coach at the University of Lancaster’s careers advisory services, says she helps humanities graduates understand that they have gained valuable, career-enhancing skills that go beyond the specific subjects such as history or English they have studied.</p> <p>“Employers are coming to me saying that they want students who can analyse complex problems, who can see different perspectives, and who can connect ideas in new ways,” Beauchamp says. “It’s about encouraging our students, and society to some extent, to see the value of humanities subjects, for their critical thinking, creativity and cultural understanding. Those are the human skills that are developed through those subjects.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>It is the work shortcut that dare not speak its name. A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.</p> <p>Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.</p> <p>Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.</p> <p>The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.</p> <p>Next week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess\">state visit to the UK</a> by Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.</p> <p>The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/dhanushi-lost-her-job-the-same-day-cba-rolled-out-an-ai-chatbot-it-may-just-be-the-beginning\">‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743\">has said</a> he wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p> <p>The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01901-x\">US study</a> circulated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.</p> <p>Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.</p> <p>“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”</p> <p>A study by the Henley Business School in May found 49% of workers reported there were no formal guidelines for AI use in their workplace and more than a quarter felt their employer did not offer enough support.</p> <p>Prof Keiichi Nakata at the school said people were more comfortable about being transparent in their use of AI than 12 months earlier but “there are still some elements of AI shaming and some stigma associated with AI”.</p> <p>He said: “Psychologically, if you are confident with your work and your expertise you can confidently talk about your engagement with AI, whereas if you feel it might be doing a better job than you are or you feel that you will be judged as not good enough or worse than AI, you might try to hide that or avoid talking about it.”</p> <p>OpenAI’s head of solutions engineering for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Matt Weaver, said: “We’re seeing huge demand from business leaders for company-wide AI rollouts – because they know using AI well isn’t a shortcut, it’s a skill. Leaders see the gains in productivity and knowledge sharing and want to make that available to everyone.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mille Colling and Emma Aalto given go-ahead to compete in qualifier for national championships next month</p>",
    "content": "<p>A British ice dancer and her skating partner are to become Finland’s first same-sex team to take part in a competition after a rule change by the country’s skating federation.</p> <p>Millie Colling, 20, who was born in Gateshead and moved to Finland at the age of six, and Emma Aalto, 19, will compete in a qualifier for the national championships next month after pressing for an amendment to the rules to allow them to enter as a team.</p> <p>The pair said they were “best friends that want to skate together”. Their request was supported by their coach, Neil Brown, who helped persuade the skating federation to agree new rules, referring to ice dance partners as Skater A and Skater B instead of man and woman.</p> <p>Colling, an art student, enrolled at skating school a year after her family moved to Finland, and Aalto, a fashion student, has been skating since she was five years old. They met two years ago.</p> <p>“We were immediately on the same level, we really clicked,” said Colling. They began to skate together but “at that point we hadn’t seen any other same-gender skating teams”.</p> <p>But this year, the retired Olympic champions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/papadakis-hubbell-skate-together-promote-same-sex-pairs-competition-2025-02-06/\">Madison Hubbell and Gabriella Papadakis performed together</a>, hoping to help break gender stereotypes in the sport. Colling said: “It was completely new and we were, whoa, OK.”</p>    <p>It was a “common misconception” that same-sex teams were gay or in a relationship, she added. “There are lots of queer athletes, and we really admire them. But it’s not the case that in order to be in a non-traditional team you have to be queer.”</p> <p>Aalto said: “The point is to be opening possibilities for everyone, not just for queer people.” Ice dancing with a same-sex partner was “not necessarily any different”, she said.</p> <p>Colling added: “One of us leads, one follows, one lifts, one of us is lifted. We have quite similar body mass, so technically there are some differences, but we still do the same content.”</p> <p>“Every partnership is different,” said Aalto. “Every couple has their own strengths and weaknesses, and their programmes are built around those strengths and weaknesses. Ice dance is a really individual sport – each couple is unique, and we’re just another unique couple.”</p> <p>If the duo qualify, they would be unable to take part in the national competition in December, as that requires further changes. “The federation has said we can’t do it yet – but fingers crossed for the future,” Colling said.</p> <p>The pair hope their participation in the qualifier will be a strong signal of change to the ice dance community and the public. They do not expect to win – “we’re just excited to get out there”, Colling said.</p> <p>They said they felt free and happy while skating. “You stop being a normal version of yourself. You can be whatever you want on the ice,” Aalto said. “It’s the best feeling – it feels like home.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 28-year-old man has been charged with arson after a fire wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said Joshua Oliver had been charged after the blaze at the offices of the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, which broke out in the early hours of Thursday.</p> <p>The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases and an NHS mental health service for veterans, which were based in the same building.</p> <p>Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Christopher Atkinson, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Joshua Oliver with arson following a police investigation into a fire at the offices of Sharon Hodgson MP.</p> <p>“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with Northumbria police as they carried out their investigation.”</p> <p>Oliver, of no fixed address, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Saturday. The CPS urged people not to share information online that could prejudice the legal proceedings.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. After the fire, a spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p>",

Three men at a nearby table were also injured.</p> <p>Javon Riley, 33, from Tottenham, north London, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/18/javon-riley-man-found-guilty-for-role-in-east-london-shooting-of-nine-year-old-girl-evin-restaurant-dalston\">found guilty last month at the Old Bailey</a> of causing grievous harm with intent to the girl and attempting to murder Mustafa Kiziltan, 35, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Nasser Ali, 44.</p> <p>Sentencing Riley on Friday, Judge Lucraft KC said the shooting was part of a dispute between two rival gangs, the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks.</p> <p>He said: “Over the last 10 years, this ongoing feud has seen a series of tit-for-tat murders and attempted murders in London and overseas.</p> <p>“In this case, your acts, and those of the others involved, mean that a nine-year-old girl and her family will have to cope with the life-changing injuries she has sustained through the mindless violence of you and others.”</p> <p>The three men who were shot were said to be affiliated with the Hackney Turks, which had a rivalry with the Tottenham Turks, with whom Riley had links, jurors had heard.</p> <p>The gunman remains at large but prosecutors said Riley had played a “key role” before, during and after the shooting.</p> <p>Riley carried out reconnaissance of the restaurant before the attack, scouted for potential targets and drove the gunman away in a stolen car, which was later burned out.</p> <p>The nine-year-old girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, spent three months in hospital and will suffer lifelong physical and cognitive problems as the bullet remains lodged in her brain.</p> <p>The three male victims received gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and thigh.</p> <p>A victim impact statement from the girl’s mother, read to the court by the judge on Friday, said the family had moved to the UK to seek a “brighter future” for their daughter, who loved gymnastics and playing the guitar.</p> <p>The statement said: “Our daughter’s joyful spirit remains, but it is now wrapped in layers of frustration and silent pain. She watches her friends do what she cannot and she carries it all inside with quiet strength.</p> <p>“This tragedy did not just change our daughter’s life, it broke something in us as a family. Every time we see her struggle, we ask ourselves why we came here and what we could have done differently. The guilt and helplessness are unbearable. For us, the trauma is relentless.</p> <p>“We live with constant fear about the future, unsure of how much more she will lose as she grows. We grieve for the dreams we once had for her: dreams of music, sport and a carefree childhood, all replaced by therapy sessions, hospital appointments and adaptions for survival.”</p> <p>She said the family was doing everything possible to show the girl that her life was “still full of possibilities” and to “make her smile”. “But the mental and emotional trauma we carry every day is heavy, a constant fear for her future and a constant grief for the life she lost and the life we imagined as a family,” she added.</p> <p>During a three-week trial, Riley was asked to identify the “third party” who had recruited him for about £40,000. He refused, citing fear for his life and for his family.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has offered up to £15,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person who fired the shots.</p> <p>DCI Joanna Yorke, who led the investigation, said: “The dangerous man responsible for pulling the trigger is walking free, and it is imperative we find him. People out there know what happened and are choosing to stay quiet. We understand that you may be worried about talking to us, but it is vital we hear from anyone who can assist this investigation.</p> <p>“Please reconsider your decision to stay silent and share what you know. Anything you say will be treated with the utmost care and confidentiality and you will be playing a huge part in securing justice for a young girl and her family.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Group opposing the proscription announces ‘major escalation’ that will culminate in London on 4 October</p>",
    "content": "<p>A<strong> </strong>week of mass actions protesting against the ban on Palestine Action has been announced, beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool and culminating in a national mobilisation in Parliament Square in London on 4 October.</p> <p>The plans were announced by Defend Our Juries on Friday, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">857 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act</a> at a demonstration outside parliament opposing the proscription. It said the next phase of the protests represented a “major escalation” that would create an “unprecedented challenge” for the police, with 1,100 people already registered to take part and risk arrest.</p> <p>“There should be no confusion about where the blame lies: it sits squarely with the government for pursuing this authoritarian ban, plunging an overstretched police force and court and prison systems which are already in crisis, into further chaos,” a spokesperson said. “The power lies with the new home secretary to end this farce by listening to MPs, lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/yvette-cooper-plan-ban-palestine-action-un-experts-lawyers\">UN experts, legal professionals</a>, human rights advocates – and the majority of her own party’s members – and lift this dangerous, anti-democratic ban.”</p> <p>They accused the prime minister, Keir Starmer, of “grotesque double standards” for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/04/israel-president-visit-london-talks-ministers-isaac-herzog\">meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, this week</a>, while people had been arrested for holding cardboard signs in support of Palestine Action. They said it made people “even more determined to do whatever it takes to overturn this unjust ban, including by targeting Starmer’s upcoming conference”.</p> <p>Protests at the party conference, which begins on 28 September, will be an unwelcome distraction for the prime minister as he attempts to address Labour’s slump in the polls.</p> <p>Defend Our Juries launched a new call for people across the country to show their defiance by placing a sign saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” – the same wording people have brandished on placards at the demonstrations – in their front windows. It follows a viral video of a former Labour councillor, Keith Hackett, being <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/4e7ddf31-b481-4179-81f6-5af95e1633ff\">told by police</a> he could legally display a poster in support of Palestine Action because it was “not in public”.</p> <p>Last Saturday’s demonstration was the second major protest organised by Defend Our Juries in defiance of the ban. Defend Our Juries claimed there were 1,500 people holding signs saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” and that the police’s failure to arrest everyone showed they were overwhelmed.</p> <p>At the previous demonstration, last month, 532 people were arrested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/10/police-arrest-hundreds-london-protest-over-palestine-action-ban\">half of whom were aged 60 or above</a>. A spokesperson claimed opposition to the ban, the first of a direct action protest group, was “growing at an exponential rate”.</p> <p>The then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/yvette-cooper-vows-ban-palestine-action-anti-terrorism-laws\">announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action</a> in June, three days after it claimed responsibility for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, although it later emerged that she was advised to proscribe the group in March. She said the group, which targeted organisations it claimed were complicit in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians, had a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and was a threat to national security.</p> <p>Since the ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails\">came into force on 5 July</a>, more than 1,600 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, including vicars, priests, doctors, former government advisers, army veterans, and many elderly and disabled people. The figure is more than were previously arrested during the entire “war on terror” <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-tact-2000-to-june-2025/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-and-subsequent-legislation-arrests-outcomes-and-stop-and-search-great-britain-quarterly-u\">since 2001</a>.</p> <p>Most have not been charged, although seven people appeared in court last week accused of being organisers of the demonstrations.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Trades Union Congress annual congress unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to repeal the proscription of Palestine Action.</p> <p>The president of the civil servants’ union said the ban represented a “significant abuse of counter-terrorist powers and a direct attack on our right to protest against the genocidal Israeli regime”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dale Vince wants ministers to ‘optimise’ resources in fossil fuel basin to help smooth transition to renewables</p>",
    "content": "<p>One of Britain’s leading green industrialists has called on the government to offer subsidies to North Sea oil companies to help support a “just transition” to renewables that protects energy industry workers.</p> <p>Dale Vince, a Labour donor, urged ministers to “optimise” the remaining resources of the declining oil basin as the UK reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">banned new North Sea oil and gas projects</a>.</p> <p>The founder of Ecotricity spoke out a week after his fellow green entrepreneur Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/27/octopus-energy-founder-greg-jackson-given-cabinet-office-role-to-help-shape-future-policies\">a Cabinet Office adviser</a>, backed calls to restart North Sea drilling.</p> <p>The Labour party swept to power in 2024 with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">halt new drilling licences in the North Sea</a>, and it plans to keep the windfall tax imposed during rocketing oil and gas prices in place until 2030.</p> <p>Vince said the government should scrap the windfall tax and instead offer subsidies to oil companies that guarantee a minimum price for the barrels of oil and gas they produce.</p> <p>“Our North Sea is in decline, let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left,” he said. “It’s time for Labour to put its arms around the North Sea and support operators with existing licences. Putting fossil fuels on an equal footing with renewables by giving them a stable price is the key to a just transition.”</p>    <p>Offshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea industry, declined to comment on whether Vince’s proposals would be welcomed by oil and gas companies. A government spokesperson said the proposal was “not under consideration. We are driving forward our mission to become a clean energy superpower, to cut bills for good.”</p> <p>They added: “We are delivering a fair and orderly transition in the North Sea to drive growth and secure tens of thousands of skilled jobs, with the biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first-of-a-kind carbon capture and storage clusters.”</p> <p>Jackson said last week that relying on North Sea oil and gas would have a smaller climate impact than relying on costly imports from the US and the Middle East, which release more emissions during production and transportation than homegrown fossil fuels.</p> <p>“When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas,” Jackson told the Telegraph. “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”</p> <p>The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there needed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist#:~:text=Fatih%20Birol%2C%20the%20IEA's%20executive,now%20%E2%80%93%20from%20this%20year.%E2%80%9D\">no new fossil fuel projects</a> if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>However, the global energy watchdog later clarified that continued investment in existing oil and gas supply would be “essential” in a net zero scenario to ensure that oil and gas supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand.</p> <p>The green industry leaders’ comments on the North Sea come amid growing pressure from opposition parties to back the industry, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">supports about 130,000 jobs</a> and contributed more than £6bn in tax receipts to the government in the last financial year and £9bn the year before.</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the party would aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/30/tories-would-maximise-north-sea-oil-and-gas-extraction-badenoch-expected-to-say\">to “maximise extraction”</a> of oil and gas in the North Sea if it won the next election. Reform UK has also promised to reverse Labour’s ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/23/reform-uk-promise-to-reverse-ban-on-north-sea-oil-drilling-if-elected\">as a “day one” priority</a> if it comes to power.</p> <p>The Guardian reported over the summer that senior government advisers had told North Sea investors that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">new drilling could still move ahead</a> despite the election promise to ban it, provided the projects were close to existing pipeline infrastructure and did not extend into “greenfield” areas.</p> <p>“Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” one energy investor said.</p> <p>The source said that while Treasury officials were open to considering future North Sea oil and gas projects, the plans were unlikely to be well received by Ed Miliband, the secretary of state of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p> <p>Miliband reportedly refused to leave his post in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle last week. ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, who first reported the claims, said it was “one part of the reshuffle that didn’t quite go Starmer’s way”.</p> <p>• The headline and introductory text of this article were amended on 11 September 2025 to clarify what Dale Vince is urging the government to do. We regret that an earlier version said he was calling on the government “to allow new North Sea oil and gas projects”; in fact, he was calling for a guaranteed minimum price for the oil and gas produced by existing North Sea fields.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/ukraine-amputee-veterans-disability-war-invasion-daniel-melnyk-marta-syrko\">military personnel who have been seriously injured</a> in the three-year war against Russia.</p> <p>During the trip to the Ukrainian capital, he and a team from his Invictus Games Foundation are set to detail new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded, with the eventual aim of providing help to all areas of the country.</p> <p>Earlier this year it was estimated that the Ukraine war had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/kyiv-league-of-the-mighty-how-amputee-football-supports-ukraine-survivors\">Kyiv’s League of the Mighty: how amputee football supports Ukraine’s survivors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian on an overnight train to the capital, the Duke of Sussex said: “We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.”</p> <p>He added: “We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”</p>    <p>The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded amputees. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/10/prince-harry-makes-unannounced-visit-to-wounded-veterans-in-ukraine\">visited the centre in April</a>, but met her by chance a couple of months ago in the US.</p> <p>“I bumped into Olga in New York. It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said ‘the biggest impact you have is coming to Kyiv’. I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.</p> <p>“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”</p> <p>Ukraine first took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/invictus-games\">Invictus Games</a> in 2017, but enthusiasm and need for the competition, which was founded by the Prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.</p> <p>The Duke remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.</p>    <p>“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out. Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield. It means so much to us, because it means so much to them.”</p> <p>During the trip, the Prince is due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He is expected to spend time with 200 veterans, who have also been invited. He is also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.</p> <p>Travelling to Kyiv would give him a chance to talk to veterans, and also see some of the destruction first-hand, he said. While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.</p> <p>Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become “a key function in veterans’ healthcare.</p> <p>“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy.”</p> <p>By March this year, more than 22,000 veterans across Ukraine had accessed benefits like gym memberships and pool passes.</p> <p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Bride finally tracks down awkward-looking stranger she and husband noticed only when looking through photos</p>",
    "content": "<p>A baffled bride has solved the mystery of the awkward-looking stranger who crashed her wedding four years ago.</p> <p>Michelle Wylie and her husband, John, registered the presence of their unidentifiable guest only as they looked through photographs of their wedding in the days after the happy occasion.</p> <p>Who was the tall man in a dark suit, distinguished by the look of quiet mortification on his face? But their family and friends could offer no explanation, nor could hotel staff at the Carlton hotel in Prestwick, where the event took place in November 2021. An appeal on Facebook likewise yielded no clues.</p> <p>Eventually, with the mystery still niggling, Wylie asked the popular Scottish content creator Dazza to cast the online net wider – and a sheepish Andrew Hillhouse finally stepped forward.</p> <p>In his explanatory post on Facebook, Hillhouse admitted that he had been “cutting it fine, as I’m known to do” when he pulled up at the wedding venue with five minutes to spare. Spotting a piper and other guests, he followed them into the hotel – “I remember thinking to myself: ‘Cool, this is obviously the right place’” – unaware that he had the address completely wrong and was supposed to be at a ceremony 2 miles away in Ayr.</p>    <p>He was initially unperturbed to find himself surrounded by strangers as the ceremony began – at the marriage he was due to attend, the only person he knew was the bride, Michaela, while his partner, Andrew, was part of the wedding party. It was when an entirely different bride came walking down the aisle that he realised: “OMG that’s not Michaela … I was at the wrong wedding!”</p> <p>Hillhouse said: “You can’t exactly stand up and walk out of a wedding mid-ceremony, so I just had to commit to this act and spent the next 20 minutes awkwardly sitting there trying to be as inconspicuous as my 6ft 2 ass could be.”</p> <p>At the end of the ceremony, Hillhouse, who is from Troon, was hoping to make a discreet exit, only to be waylaid by the wedding photographer, who insisted he join other guests for a group shot. He can be spotted looming uncomfortably at the very back of the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/02/paris-startup-invitin-app-selling-strangers-invites-to-weddings\">‘As if we’re real guests’: the startup selling strangers invitations to weddings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His post continued: “Rushed outside, made some phone calls and made my way to the correct wedding, where I was almost as popular as the actual bride and groom, and spent most of the night retelling that story to people.”</p> <p>For Michelle Wylie, this amiable resolution brings to a close years of speculation.</p>    <p>She told BBC Scotland: “It would come into my head and I’d be like: ‘Someone must know who this guy is.’ I said a few times to my husband: ‘Are you sure you don’t know this guy, is he maybe from your work?’ We wondered if he was a mad stalker.”</p> <p>She is now Facebook friends with Hillhouse and the pair have met in person to cement their coincidental bond.</p> <p>“I could not stop laughing,” said Wylie. “We can’t believe we’ve found out who he is after almost four years.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p> <p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p> <p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\" data-alt=\"a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile.</p> <p>The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further.</p> <p>“Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.”</p> <p>The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London.</p> <p>Business groups have blamed Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution</a>, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business.</p> <p>Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade.</p> <p>“The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.”</p> <p>The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.</p> <p>However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence.</p> <p>Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.”</p> <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on.</p> <p>“Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.”</p> <p>Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed.</p> <p>The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">jumped to 3.8% in July</a>, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.</p> <p>Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.</p>",

Inland areas will also experience stormy weather, with most of England and Wales experiencing 45mph to 55mph gusts.</p> <p>Delays to transport are likely, along with a slight risk of injuries and danger to life from flying debris, the forecaster added.</p> <p>Stephen Kocher, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said that from Sunday, strong west or southwesterly winds would arrive at coastal areas in south-west England and Wales then spread inland.</p> <p>The Met Office said the weather had been caused by a deepening area of low pressure travelling eastwards across the Atlantic.</p> <p>While there has been speculation that the weekend’s weather will bring the first named storm of the season – expected to be Storm Amy – the Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said on Friday that there was currently no plan to name the storm.</p> <p>“Obviously we are in meteorological autumn now; it’s the sort of weather that we do expect at this time of year,” he said. “So it’s nothing unusual, particularly – perhaps it’s just the contrast with the weather that we have enjoyed over most of the summer.”</p> <p>The Met Office has advised those in the alert area to prepare by protecting their property, including securing loose outdoor items such as bins, sheds, fences and garden furniture.</p> <p>There will be a brief reprieve from the intense weather on Tuesday but Madge warned that more severe gales could hit exposed coastal areas again on Wednesday. He said it was too early to tell where the impact would be but that it would be less severe than the winds arriving on Sunday.</p> <p>“Drivers are really going to feel the effects of the early autumnal weather this weekend,” said Rod Dennis, a spokesperson for the RAC breakdown service.</p> <p>“This will particularly be the case later on Sunday and into the new working week – strong gusty winds will make driving conditions challenging across a large swathe of southern and western Britain.</p> <p>“The wind will be particularly noticeable on more exposed roads, like those over the moors in Devon and Cornwall, so drivers may like to delay their journeys or seek other routes.</p> <p>“We urge anyone setting out to reduce their speeds while driving and pass high-sided vehicles with particular care.”</p> <p>Sunshine and drier conditions are most likely to be found in the east, though temperatures will remain on the cooler side, with highs of about 17C to 18C expected in London on Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/mps-asda-app-loans-wagestream",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Retailer’s owner has stake in Wagestream, which offers workers loans of up to £25,000</p>",
    "content": "<p>An influential group of MPs has sought assurances that Asda is not “squeezing staff” to drive profit after it emerged they are being offered high-interest loans by Wagestream, a company in which the retailer’s owner has a stake.</p> <p>The business and trade select committee has written to Asda over its links to the “financial wellbeing app” that recently began offering the supermarket’s staff loans of up to £25,000. The default arrangements for Wagestream’s “workplace loans” involve debt repayments being directly deducted from workers’ pay packets.</p> <p> A holding company controlled by Asda’s private equity owner TDR Capital is a shareholder in Wagestream, which has been offering Asda workers a range of other services, including savings pots and wage advances, since 2023.</p> <p>Documents filed at Companies House show that the holding company, Bellis Financial Investments 2, is one of a number of shareholders in Wagestream, alongside former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital, and social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund.</p> <p>However, the Guardian understands that the retailer did not flag its financial link to Wagestream to staff when it initially launched the service to workers two years ago. Wagestream – which this week rebranded itself as Stream – started offering “workplace loans” to Asda staff earlier this year.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade committee, said he had written to Asda “to ask them to reassure us that frontline workers aren’t left facing sky-high interest rates, and that its workplace lending is compliant with Asda’s legal requirements under employment law”.</p> <p>“Asda is one of Britain’s most important employers with over 150,000 workers and is at the heart of our grocery market,” he said. </p> <p>“Our concern today is that instead of easing Asda’s debts, its parent company may<strong> </strong>be piling pressure on Asda’s people – squeezing staff to service liabilities and drive profit to its financial investments. If this is the case, it raises serious questions as to Asda’s responsible stewardship, and the long-term financial sustainability of the business as a whole.”</p> <p>Asda’s finance director, Michael Gleeson, told the committee in 2023 that a £100m investment in Wagestream and two other financial services businesses had been funded out of proceeds from the £1.7bn sale of Asda’s warehouses, which the company now has to pay rent on under a leaseback deal. “We are part owners of each of those three companies,” he told MPs. Bellis is understood to hold a 4% stake in Wagestream.</p> <p>Asda said it does not pay Wagestream for any services or receive any financial benefit if a member of staff chooses to use the app. However, as a shareholder, Asda’s parent group has a direct interest in its success and would have the right to a share of any future dividend payments or proceeds from the sale of the group.</p> <p>Wagestream is yet to pay a dividend and remains loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in 2024.</p> <p>That could change before long, however, with revenues having grown by more than two-thirds (64%) to £36.9m last year, when it handed out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn.</p> <p>The rollout of workplace loans could propel earnings, which have so far relied on fees linked to its wage advance product. Wagestream said a rise in revenues in the upcoming year would probably outpace costs and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Asda, which is the UK’s third largest supermarket, said: “Asda offers colleagues access to a range of established financial products through a partner regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These include salary advances, workplace loans and savings products paying a competitive interest rate of 4.33%, which is currently used by more than 18,000 colleagues.</p> <p>“Many other large employers, including all of Asda’s direct competitors in the grocery sector, offer similar products to their employees through the same or competitor providers.”</p> <p>Asda added that all applications for Wagestream’s workplace loans were subject to “robust affordability checks” before being approved. “At present, fewer than 2% of Asda colleagues have taken out a loan. The representative APR on these loans is 13.9%.”</p> <p>Wagestream began rolling out the loans to clients including Asda at the end of 2024. Those loans come with a representative APR of between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.</p> <p>But the ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its model still saves borrowers an average of £593 a loan, with customers having been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the app.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said it was concerned about the financial links between Asda and Wagestream: “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that TDR has a financial interest in the app that facilitates Asda workers taking these financial risks, while also being the overall decision-maker for how much these workers are paid and the hours they are able to work.”</p> <p>“We now find out that Wagestream is offering dangerous loans at high interest rates and GMB members working in Asda tell us they have used the app to take advances on their pay, which can contribute to a cycle of debt.</p> <p>“The bottom line is that employers should pay workers enough to live on, to have savings and to not need to rely on dangerous high-interest loans or advances on their pay just to cover day-to-day living costs.”</p> <p>Wagestream said in a statement that “as a regulated financial services provider, Wagestream has a conflicts of interest policy and has implemented processes to review and monitor conflicts of interest to comply with FCA rules.”</p> <p>“TDR Capital’s holding in Wagestream does not create a conflict as it falls well below the thresholds set out by the FCA. As a minority shareholder, TDR Capital does not have operational or day-to-day control of any of Wagestream’s undertakings,” the statement added.</p> <p>Wagestream said it considers potential conflicts when deciding on whether to partner with employers, which in turn sign its terms and conditions that require good consumer outcomes and transparency, including around fees.</p> <p>TDR declined to comment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It was left to a – albeit extinct – tiny relative of the kangaroo to offer some relief from the blizzard of major events</p>",
    "content": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Where to start in a week so fraught with major events you could hardly draw breath for the news flashes? It started with Trump’s alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book,” shared by the Democrats on social media on Monday and leading to the discovery of a name not widely recognised in the US but of intense interest in the UK – Peter Mandelson. The British ambassador to the US had proffered an undiplomatically warm birthday message to the late child sex offender financier, starting a press scramble that ended, on Thursday, with Keir Starmer firing him.</p> <p>That was just the beginning. As Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Nato jets, forecasts of a third world war gained pace and in the US, Charlie Kirk, a rightwing political activist, was assassinated in front of a crowd in Utah. Another firing followed: at MSNBC, the analyst Matthew Dowd was swiftly booted for suggesting that Kirk, who had a history of making racist and sexist remarks, had learned the hard way that, “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”. On the Christian right, meanwhile, Kirk instantly rose to the status of an American martyr.</p> <p>If it was a week in which America looked, once again, like an increasingly dysfunctional and unhappy place and Europe slid towards darker days, it was left to Australia to cheer us, which it did with – what else? – the discovery of a new marsupial: a tiny, previously unknown relative of the kangaroo, a sort of mouse-wallaby hybrid species of “bettong”, identified by its fossil remains because, in keeping with the general state of the world and because we can’t have nice things, it turns out it is already extinct.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Also extinct (almost): that species of lovable eccentric billionaire who stays out of politics and spends his cash on decommissioned Soviet fighter jets and a luxury car collection. In other words, Larry Ellison, the 90s playboy and founder of Oracle with the lustrous, tan-coloured mane to make Elon Musk weep. At the turn of the millennium Ellison was the world’s richest man, long since eclipsed by the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos, but like all things from the 90s he’s back with a vengeance and this week, after Oracle’s stock price soared, once again took the top spot.</p> <p>Per the business pages, Oracle’s shares soared owing to a “rosy outlook for [the company’s] cloud infrastructure business and AI deals”. I’m more interested in revisiting the greatest hits of a billionaire whose biographer, Mike Wilson, once described as “a one-man amusement park, Larryland.” To wit: Ellison flying his Marchetti S.211 fighter plane in mock dog fights over the Pacific with his son, David; winning the Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 with a young Lachlan Murdoch onboard; and my favourite Ellison flourish, what was said to be his favourite chat-up line of the 90s – “Can I buy you a car?”</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>More news from Australia that is almost as charming as a marsupial: Russell Crowe (I know, he’s originally from New Zealand), gussied up in a Nazi uniform and gone the full Brando in the trailer for Nuremberg. Crowe plays Hermann Göring, who at the time of his capture apparently weighed 280 pounds and was described by an allied soldier who witnessed it as a “huge bulk”, an acting challenge to which Crowe appears to have magnificently risen. The forthcoming movie co-stars Rami Malek, Michael Shannon and Leo Woodall, but clearly this is Rusty’s picture. His German accent – “I vill have, as you say, my day I court” – is worth the ticket price alone and appears to be a combo of ‘Allo ‘Allo!’s Gestapo corps and, as Crowe once said of his accent in Gladiator, “Royal Shakespeare Company three pints after lunch.” Bravo!</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The huge bulk of Emily’s saggy old cat, Bagpuss, is coming back in a new film to make gen X cry. For those not born in the 20th century, Bagpuss was an old cloth cat with pink stripes and piercing blue eyes, who lived in a shop for lost and found items with his friends Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the doll and the mice on the mouse organ (“Heave! Heave!). News of the reboot this week sent me straight to YouTube to watch the opening sequence of Oliver Postgate’s TV show, broadcast in the mid- to late-70s on repeat and almost unbearably poignant, not least because it’s narrated in an accent that no longer exists.</p> <p>Bagpuss (“The most important, the most beautiful, the most magical, saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world”) is embedded in the earliest TV memories of those of us who were kids at the time and, having a moment at my screen, I called over my 10-year-old to share in the magic. She watched for 20 seconds, said, “Boring!”, patted me sympathetically on the arm and walked off. “Baggy and a bit loose at the seams,” I murmured in unison with Postgate, “but Emily loved him.”</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Prince Harry met the king in London this week after an apparent estrangement of 19 months and, according to those monitoring the arrival and departure of the prince’s car, the audience lasted 54 minutes. But that’s a generous interpretation of the actual face time involved in the “private tea”, which, allowing for entrance and egress through Clarence House, settling in and waiting time, surely came out closer to half an hour. Did Harry whip out his phone and show his father photos of the two grandchildren he’s spent almost no time with? Did the king ask about Meghan? Was it all about money? Was there ever a more pitiful sight than, generation after generation, the royal family’s cold and strained filial relations?</p>",

This increase was driven primarily by the services and construction sectors, but production output fell by 1.3%. However, growth is slowing in these sectors and is likely the result of actions taken by the Labour government now being realised, with the increase in employer national insurance contributions having a significant impact on business confidence. </p> <p>“With the summer now over and the economy supposedly getting out of its slumber, we now face continuing uncertainty in the lead up to the budget in November given the precarious position the Chancellor finds the public finances in. It is estimated that the fiscal hole that needs to be plugged is anywhere between £20bn and £50bn. While that is a wide range, it means one thing for a government that has shown it will struggle to cut spending – more tax rises. </p> <p>“Speculation is already rife about which taxes will be raised, and without the ability to raise the main revenue generators – income tax, national insurance and VAT – the government is left with targeting multiple sectors for small amounts of revenue. This is increasing the headwinds for the UK economy and with still over two months to go, GDP readings for the second half of the year are unlikely to pretty reading. For government under as much pressure as it is at the moment, this will be a very difficult corner to get itself out of.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c3b9418f0880bae9c51f37\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-12T06:13:58.536Z\">7.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chart: three monthly GDP growth slowed again in July</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a chart showing how growth has slowed, when looking at GDP over a three-month period:</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c3b8de8f086519d32706bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-12T06:09:10.929Z\">7.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ONS: production sector is falling back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>ONS </strong>director of economic statistics<strong> Liz McKeown </strong>says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months.

    "content": "<p>The chief executive of Barclays has said the UK government needs to limit pay rises for public sector workers and resist a further “squeeze” on banks with tax increases.</p> <p>CS Venkatakrishnan said the government needed to look at its own spending levels as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seeks ways to address a fiscal hole when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">announces her budget in November</a>.</p> <p>“We need to curb expenditure at the government level,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8589b6ec-1c3b-4c1d-8352-8664325bf698\">told the Financial Times</a>. “We need to find a way to curb wage inflation.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishnan said that while the government needed to restrict rising “public sector” wages, the inflationary impact of pay rises was an issue across the UK economy.</p> <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said Venkatakrishnan had a “brass neck” calling for pay rise curbs when his pay packet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/barclays-profit-rise-ceo-cs-venkatakrishnan-more-pay\">doubled to £10.5m last year</a>, the highest for a Barclays boss since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-pay\">Bob Diamond received £17m in 2011.</a></p> <p>“It is frankly insulting for him to call on nurses, teachers and paramedics to tighten their belts when he’s just pocketed a bumper pay rise,” said Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>“Instead of talking down public sector workers, those with the broader shoulders – including the mega-wealthy like CS Venkatakrishnan, banks and gambling companies – should contribute their fair share to funding our schools, hospitals and local authorities.”</p> <p>While UK wage growth has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/the-uk-labour-market-is-cooling-but-this-is-a-slowdown-not-a-collapse\">slowed in recent months</a>, it is still running at an annual rate of 5.7% in the public sector, excluding bonuses. Private sector wage growth is running at an average of 4.8%.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: “Someone happily accepting a pay package of £10.5m doesn’t really have the moral authority to tell nurses and teachers and local government workers they shouldn’t get a pay rise.</p> <p>“It would be a lot easier to fund decent wages for public sector workers if the wealth of multimillionaires was taxed more effectively, so if the Barclays CEO is concerned about the sustainability of public finances, he would look a lot less crass and hypocritical if he used his position to argue for a wealth tax on the super-rich instead.” </p> <p>Venkatakrishnan also said the banking sector should not be a target of further taxation. “UK banks are taxed more than banks anywhere else,” he said. “How much more are you going to squeeze this?”</p> <p>Banks are concerned that the industry’s reliable profits, fuelled by higher interest rates, could make it one of the targets for tax increases as Reeves comes under pressure to raise taxes to address a hole in her fiscal plans.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/29/uk-bank-shares-tumble-after-call-for-windfall-tax-on-lenders-in-budget\">UK bank shares tumbled</a>, cutting the combined market value of some of the biggest companies in the sector by more than £6bn, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the budget spooked investors.</p> <p>“I hope it’s an extremely low possibility,” said Venkatakrishnan. “London is a great global financial centre and the path to growth does not lie to taxing the sector even more. I have had the view from day one that this is a government that is pro business and particularly pro the financial industry.”</p> <p>He claimed the UK banks had, in effect, a total tax rate of about 46% last year, compared with 28% in New York and 29% to 39% in the EU.</p> <p>Barclays made £5.7bn in pre-tax profits last year in the UK, and paid almost £1.4bn in total tax. Of this, £198m was corporation tax and £154m for the bank levy.</p> <p>“What I hope and expect is that they will take this time to think through the difficult choices they have to make,” Venkatakrishnan said. “No budget keeps everyone happy, but the object of it is to foster growth in the country.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishan has been a vocal supporter of Reeves and the wider Labour government’s policies since it took power last summer, but has recently spoken out against proposals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/13/uk-bank-ringfencing-deregulation-financial-services-rachel-reeves\">change ringfencing rules</a> that force UK banks to separate their retail and riskier investment banking operations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former White House adviser turns spotlight on ‘resilient’ region with new podcast Forged in the North</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a “resilience and grit” that comes from being born in the north-east of England, says Fiona Hill, who went from a working-class childhood in County Durham to a top intelligence job at the heart of the White House.</p> <p>But, she believes, it is also a big reason why she and other notable high achievers have had the success they have. The secret of success could be being from the north-east.</p> <p>Hill has talked to a number of figures from – or with strong links to – the north-east for her new Forged in the North podcast series, which will be launched at <a href=\"https://newwritingnorth.com/event/fiona-hill-forged-in-the-north/\">Durham book festival in October</a>.</p> <p>They include two global figures originally from the same part of Wallsend: the Cramlington primary school teacher turned superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/22/the-last-ship-review-sting\">Sting</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/05/academicexperts.highereducationprofile\">the Yale historian Paul Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>“It’s basically just listening to two people who seem on the surface so completely different but have this common origin story,” says Hill.</p> <p>Other podcast guests are Lee Hall, the writer of Billy Elliot; Brendan Foster, the founder of the Great North Run; the north-east mayor, Kim McGuinness; the Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Sara Davies; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/03/oscar-conclave-peter-straughan-best-adapted-screenplay\">dramatist Peter Straughan</a>; and the Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p>Hill was born and brought up in Bishop Auckland, the daughter of a coalminer and a midwife. She and her accent went on to be a foreign affairs adviser to US presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump and she is considered one of the world’s leading experts on Russia and Putin.</p> <p>Last year she was named as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/19/labour-defence-adviser-fiona-hill\">three advisers to oversee the UK government’s strategic defence review</a>.</p> <p>The new series is born, Hill says, of a belief that “too much happens down in London, as if the rest of the country doesn’t exist”.</p> <p>The hope is to “put the spotlight on a region that is normally only in the headlines for something going wrong: child poverty, the lowest life expectancy, worst nutrition”, she says.</p> <p>“The north-east is home of the Industrial Revolution – literally the engines of prosperity. Two hundred years ago, it was the forefront of innovation, and we’re saying, there’s still a lot of potential for innovation.”</p> <p>Hill turns 60 this year and is planning a trip back to the north-east from her home in the US. She says: “I’ve always wanted to walk along a portion of Hadrian’s Wall, I want to go back up the Northumberland coast. I want to come back for all the stories and storytelling I remember as a kid from the region.”</p> <p>It was in this context that the idea of the podcast series came about, with the aim of telling stories about the north “not just how it was, but how it is and how it might be”.</p> <p>Many cultural figures have talked passionately about the importance of where they are from. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/bbc-to-be-unashamedly-hull-centric-during-city-year-in-cultural-spotlight\">Hull-born playwright Richard Bean once said</a>: “Thank God I wasn’t born in Guildford. Thank God I was born somewhere there is tragedy and comedy every other second.”</p> <p>Hill says coming from the north-east gives “a certain resilience and grit”. “Being from the north-east grounds you, it’s an anchor, a solid base with a strong sense of what’s right and wrong and a clear perspective and values.”</p> <p>She points to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52269-how-strong-are-regional-identities-in-britain\">a recent poll</a> revealing how people from the north-east have a stronger attachment to their region than other parts of England. “There’s a sense of solidarity that’s been forged in adversity. Everyone’s thrown all kinds of rubbish at the north historically … but it has a resilience.”</p> <p>The importance of investing in people while they are young is a theme of the podcast discussions, says Hill, who got a grant from the Durham Miners’ Association to take a Russian language course to pursue her ambition to go to university.</p> <p>Straughan and Hall got started with enterprise grants and through locally funded theatres. Interestingly, McGuinness and Davies, both younger interviewees, say they had to make their own luck, with Davies using her savings to start her successful business.</p> <p>McGuinness says the series resonated with her ambition for the north-east to be a cultural powerhouse. “This important podcast shines a light on how with the right support, talent can truly thrive.</p> <p>“Funding in our region’s art sector has been outpaced by the south for some time. I’m determined to fix that cultural chasm and the cycle of regional inequality, positioning the north-east as a strong contender in the UK economy.”</p>",

He told Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> <p>Who to believe? Frankly, the government’s boast is absurd. As anybody who follows the pharma sector knows, the big multinational firms are all obsessing over precisely the issues identified by Bell.</p> <p>The first is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">the amount of money the UK spends on medicines</a>: 9% of its healthcare budget, versus 17% in Germany and Italy and 15% in France. The second is the “clawback” mechanism that caps the NHS’s spending on prescription medicines. The formula last year spat out a figure of 23% to be recouped from firms, whereas equivalent European schemes tend to be in single digits. Such out-of-line ratios deter investment, goes the industry’s argument.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">What is the row between Wes Streeting and pharmaceutical companies about?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One possible reaction is to say big pharma makes big profits and the government is only doing its job if it tries to drive a hard bargain on drug prices. Another is to point out that the UK still has excellent long-term research and development infrastructure – world-class labs, universities, pots of public money for manufacturing – that even the most commercially minded pharma company ought to view separately from a quarrel over the price the NHS pays for medicines.</p> <p>Sadly, real life is not so simple. The Trump factor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/27/tough-talk-from-streeting-but-he-still-needs-a-deal-with-big-pharma\">as described in this column</a> a couple of weeks ago, has changed the dynamic. The president is demanding that US drug prices fall towards European levels; thus the companies do not want the UK, which has traditionally been able to force some of the lowest prices among rich European countries, to be used as a reference point. One can accuse the drugmakers of being ruthless or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">shortsighted</a>, but the cold reality is that they choose where to invest. The Merck example suggests that the mood is genuinely hardening.</p> <p>The company is not a fly-by-night operator. It has been in the UK for almost a century and is a big commercial presence in the Francis Crick Institute, one of those pieces of valuable infrastructure that, supposedly, was meant to tie firms into the UK. Government ministers comforted themselves that Merck is keeping 1,600 jobs in the UK and will continue to run clinical trials here. But the lifeblood of the life sciences is new investment. Merck is pulling the plug on a building that is half-built; other companies’ investments that, invisibly, don’t happen are just as damaging over time.</p> <p>As previously argued, one can sympathise with Wes Streeting, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">who walked away from price negotiations</a> by the pharma trade body last month. He inherited tensions that are a decade old and the new US factor has raised the stakes massively. Then there is the complication of official “value for money” criteria for new medicines that have not changed since 2001 (the industry’s other big complaint). The backdrop is the Treasury’s budget constraints. There is no easy answer.</p> <p>But a good first step would be to stop officials making silly statements about the UK being the best place in the world to invest. Yes, there are underlying strengths – the ministerial pitch about the UK becoming “a life sciences superpower” isn’t completely dreamy. But Bell is right when he says “without large companies, it isn’t going to work”. At the moment, it isn’t working.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from Rachel Reeves.</p> <p>Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job.</p> <p>The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">Growth flatlined in July</a>, slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year.</p> <p>Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers.</p> <p>Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/retail-sales-rise-but-ons-apologises-as-statistics-crisis-deepens\">decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025</a> women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services.</p> <p>The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds.</p> <p>Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment.</p> <p>As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances.</p> <p>Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/uk-hit-by-fresh-sell-off-in-government-bond-markets-as-pound-weakens\">Bond market investors</a> are watching closely.</p> <p>Among the big concerns is that speculation over the tax changes in the budget will dampen business activity over the coming months, even before November arrives, in a carbon copy of Labour’s first months back in office last year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power.</p> <p>On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/29/imf-global-growth-forecast-trump-tariffs-eu-trade-us\">International Monetary Fund</a> – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges.</p> <p>Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Up to 400 large shops are at risk of closure with as many as 100,000 jobs at risk if the government goes ahead with plans to hit stores with higher business rates, retailers have warned.</p> <p>Some of the UK’s largest retail premises, including supermarkets and department stores, would face higher property tax charges under new rules being considered by the government before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">November’s budget</a>.</p> <p>The higher charges for larger sites, including warehouses, offices and other premises, are intended to pay for discounts for smaller business properties, such as independent retailers, cafes and pubs, after the Labour government pledged to make the business rates system fairer.</p> <p>The bosses of big retailers including John Lewis, Lidl and B&amp;Q met the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, last week to ask her to exclude retail from the surcharge.</p> <p>The new rules are targeted at all business premises with a rateable value – a figure linked to rents – of more than £500,000. The surcharge could apply to 4,000 large retail outlets, according to the British Retail Consortium, which represents most large retail groups.</p> <p>The BRC looked at how a similar level of increased costs had affected retail businesses in the past to estimate how many of sites might be forced to close under the planned tax change. It concluded that 400 big stores could close. It said retailers might also raise prices or cut jobs in order to protect their profits.</p> <p>Some of the potentially affected retail outlets are so-called anchor tenants, big retailers that play a key role in attracting visitors to high streets and shopping centres, and driving trade to nearby cafes, pubs and other retailers.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Britain’s largest shops are magnets, pulling people into high streets, shopping centres and retail parks, supporting thousands of surrounding cafes, restaurants and smaller and independent shops. After years of rising costs, far too many stores have disappeared – leaving behind empty shells that once thrived at the heart of our communities.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/11/pre-budget-howls-from-big-business-beasts-go-deeper-than-the-usual-tax-grumbles\">Pre-budget howls from big business beasts go deeper than the usual tax grumbles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reeves wrote to ministers this week, saying: “We want to see thriving high streets and small businesses investing in their future, not held back by outdated rules or strangled by red tape.</p> <p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck. That’s why growth is our number one mission.”</p> <p>The chancellor indicated that the government was considering changes to business rates to tackle so called “cliff edges”, which can lead to a leap in taxes when a small business wants to expand.</p> <p>Her comments accompanied an interim report on government plans for business rate changes, published on Thursday, which included changing the way rates were calculated and improving support for investment in premises.</p> <p>Kate Nicholls, the chair of the UKHospitality, which represents thousands of restaurants, pubs and cafes, said: “For too long, the broken business rates system has unfairly punished hospitality businesses and I’m pleased that the government is taking action to reform it.</p> <p>“These measures to remove punitive cliff-edges and barriers to investment are positive and will help to rebalance the system, as will the government’s commitment to lower business rates bills for hospitality businesses.”</p>",

He has this gorgeous velvet cape with a jewelled trim and he’s wearing a Spanish real, a coin, around his neck, and this metal gorget [covering the throat], which glints.</p> <p>“I think spending time dwelling on those details is really rewarding and there’s also this amazing unknowable quality about his face. He’s almost holding something back. I think it’s a fun one for people to engage with it because they’re meeting Rembrandt so there’s a sense of direct interaction.”</p> <p>The average museum or gallery visitor <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/guide-slow-looking\">is said to spend just eight seconds looking at each artwork</a>.</p> <p>“People want to feel like they’ve seen everything,” Orrock said. “What we’re doing is trying to provide lots of different ways into the picture.”</p>    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/nature/how-walking-in-nature-can-help-wellbeing\">the mental health benefits of being in nature are widely known</a>, the expectation is that drinking in the Rembrandt will offer similar restorative effects.</p> <p>“We’re hoping it will provide that sort of escape from reality and that moment to have a bit of time out,” said Orrock. “It’s about giving people permission to stop and look – people can relax for as long as they like with the picture.”</p> <p>The tour, Meet Rembrandt: A Slow Looking Experience, starts at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/dorset/kingston-lacy\">Kingston Lacy, Dorset</a>, on Friday before heading to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/dunham-massey\">Dunham Massey in Cheshire</a> in March 2026 and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/warwickshire/upton-house-and-gardens\">Upton House in Warwickshire</a> in July next year.</p> <p>Visitors will have the option to explore the painting’s history through audio guides featuring insights from conservators, art historians, and even imagined reflections from Rembrandt himself.</p> <p>But one of the guide’s channels will be devoted to a “slow looking guided meditation”. Orrock said: “There’s a gong and a soothing voice. You’re encouraged to think about your physical state while you’re looking at the picture, things like putting both feet on the floor, taking a deep breath, just letting your eyes travel over the painting. There’s not a right or wrong thing to see – it’s just about allowing yourself that time with the picture and seeing what comes out for you.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Conservative party is facing questions over a possible breach of electoral law involving one of its largest benefactors, after leaked files cast doubt on official declarations of donations worth £2.6m.</p> \n<p>More than 40 donations to the Tories over 23 years have been registered in the name of Rosemary Saïd, a British woman.</p> \n<p>But leaked documents marked “official – sensitive”, seen by the Guardian, renew long-running questions about whether it is her husband, the billionaire businessman Wafic Saïd, who is the real source of the money even though he is barred by electoral law from donating.</p> \n<p>One of the documents, an official government log from Boris Johnson’s time in Downing Street, contains the entry: “Political meeting with Wafic Said (donor) and Rosemary Said.”</p> \n<p>Wafic also had two separate phone calls with Johnson and senior aides without his wife, according to other logs.</p> \n<p>A Canadian citizen resident in Monaco, Wafic, 85, is barred by law from donating because he is not eligible to vote in the UK. Rosemary, 79, is allowed to give money and the Conservative party has declared donations in her name between 2001 and 2024. Johnson declared a £10,000 contribution from her during his leadership campaign.</p> \n<p>When contacted for comment, Wafic Saïd said: “My wife is an independently wealthy woman who has been a strong supporter of the Conservative party her entire life.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I have not made donations to the Conservative party for at least 25 years, and any suggestion otherwise would be clearly untrue and would be a very serious matter for me, as I always respect the law.”</p> \n<p>A Conservative party spokesperson said it carried out “proper due diligence” on the donations and added: “We do not comment on purported leaked documents, which may have been obtained or manipulated by hostile states.”</p> \n<p>The files were obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked and hacked documents. DDoS has said it does not know the provenance of the data. The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files have been doctored.</p> \n<h2>Rise to prominence</h2> \n<p>Born in Damascus, Wafic came to Britain in the 1960s and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/29/business.politics\">ran a restaurant</a> in west London. He rose to prominence as a fixer for Saudi royals, playing a role in arms sales from the UK to the kingdom.</p> \n<p>He gave money – reportedly £300,000 – to the Tories in the 1990s but stopped after scandals over foreign donations led to them being banned. From 2001, the Conservatives began to declare donations in Rosemary’s name.</p> \n<p>The leaked file showing that it was Wafic – rather than Rosemary – who was described as a donor appears in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">trove of documents</a> from Boris Johnson’s private office obtained by DDoS and seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The documents contain logs recorded by civil servants that keep a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities.</p> \n<p>The entry identifying Wafic as the donor was made on 12 September 2019, over<strong> </strong>a month into Johnson’s premiership. It says he and two top aides spent an hour and a half with the Saïds.</p> \n<p>Although the log entry is not a formal statement of a donor’s identity, other records show Wafic enjoyed the kind of privileged access to a prime minister typically granted to donors, rather than merely a donor’s spouse.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In June 2020, as the Covid pandemic raged, Johnson found half an hour for what the official log records as “political phone calls”, meaning Tory party matters rather than affairs of state. He was joined by Ben Elliot, the fellow Old Etonian whom Johnson had appointed party chair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/27/can-i-now-send-the-funds-secrets-of-the-conservative-money-machine\">turbocharge fundraising</a>, on a call to Wafic. It appears to have been followed by a call with a major donor.</p> \n<p>In March 2021, on a train journey from Stoke-on-Trent to London, Johnson made a quick call to another donor and then phoned Wafic again.</p> \n<p>Other “political” meetings and phone calls recorded in the logs were between Johnson and Conservative party donors, ministers, staff or advisers.</p> \n<p>There is no record of Rosemary being on the calls with Wafic and she is not named in the logs – which cover all but two months of Johnson’s time in No 10 – apart from on the Downing Street meeting she attended with Wafic.</p> \n<p>Wafic said: “At my age, I do not recall these conversations. However, it is entirely possible that he [Johnson] may have called to thank me for my contribution to Covid vaccine research.” In 2020, Wafic <a href=\"https://www.development.ox.ac.uk/news/oxfords-vaccine-research-and-development-boosted-by-donation-from-wafic-said\">gave £3m to the University of Oxford</a> to fund that work.</p> \n<p>Steve Goodrich, the head of research at Transparency International UK and a former Electoral Commission senior policy adviser, said “credible allegations of rule breaking” should be investigated.</p> \n<p>“Electoral law is crystal clear that parties and politicians can only accept donations from permissible sources, and recipients must verify the source of funds,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Conservative party spokesperson said it “only accepts permissible donors as set out in law. Proper due diligence was undertaken to ensure that these donations were permissible and accurately reported. Other individuals can support a political party without being a donor.”</p> \n<p>Wafic also said he had known Johnson since “long before he became prime minister”.</p> \n<p>Approached for comment, Johnson did not respond to specific questions about the donations. He likened the Guardian’s coverage of the leaked files to Soviet propaganda.</p> \n<h2>‘True friend and admirer’</h2> \n<p>The files also contain a copy of a letter Wafic wrote to Johnson when he resigned as prime minister. He said it had been “emotional” watching Johnson’s final speech from the dispatch box and he commended him on a “legacy to be proud of”.</p> \n<p>“I really enjoyed all the meetings we had, whether in person or via Zoom,” Wafic went on. “I hope that now you are free of the burdens of high office, we will be able to see you more often. I also hope that you realise that in me you have a true friend and admirer. Rosemary joins me in sending you and all your family our warmest wishes and fond affection.”</p> \n<p>Johnson replied: “I am proud of my time in office although there is of course much more I would have liked to achieve given the opportunity. I am grateful for your ongoing support and friendship.” He added: “Please send my best to Rosemary, and I look forward to seeing you soon.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Plus <strong>Gilliane Petrie </strong>on the dangers of romantic relationships with chatbots</p>",
    "content": "<p>Marcus Beard’s article on artificial&nbsp;intelligence slopaganda (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/09/angela-rayner-ai-slopaganda-politics-technology-deepfakes\">No, that wasn’t Angela Rayner dancing and rapping: you’ll need to understand AI slopaganda, 9 September</a>) highlights a growing problem – what happens when we no longer know what is true? What will the erosion of trust do to our society?</p> <p>The rise of deepfakes is increasing at an ever faster rate due to the ease at which anyone can create realistic images, audio and even video. Generative AI models have now become so sophisticated that a <a href=\"https://www.iproov.com/press/study-reveals-deepfake-blindspot-detect-ai-generated-content\">recent survey</a> showed that less than 1% of respondents could correctly identify the best deepfake images and videos.</p> <p>This content is being used to manipulate, defraud, abuse and mislead people. Fraud using AI cost the US $12.3bn in 2023 and <a href=\"https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime#:~:text=The%20banking%20sector%20is%20expecting,from%20%2412.3bn%20in%202023.%E2%80%9D\">Deloitte predicts</a> that could reach $40bn by 2027. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/how-ai-driven-fraud-challenges-the-global-economy-and-ways-to-combat-it/\">World Economic Forum predicts</a> that AI fraud will turbocharge cybercrime to over $10tn by the end of this year.</p> <p>We also have a new generation of children who are increasingly reliant on AI to inform them about the world, but who controls AI? That is why I am calling on parliament to act now, by making it a criminal offence to create or distribute AI-generated content without clearly labelling it. What I am proposing is that all AI-generated content be clearly labelled; that AI-created content carry a permanent watermark; and that failure to comply should carry legal consequences.</p> <p>This isn’t about censorship – it’s&nbsp;about transparency, truth and&nbsp;trust. Similar steps are already&nbsp;being taken in the EU, the US and <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/china-releases-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-ai-labeling-law\">China</a>. The UK must not fall&nbsp;behind. If we don’t act now, the&nbsp;truth itself may become optional. So <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/715706\">I am petitioning</a> the&nbsp;government to protect trust and&nbsp;integrity, and prevent&nbsp;the&nbsp;harmful use of AI.<br><strong>Stewart MacInnes</strong><br><em>Little Saxham, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Regarding your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’, 9 September</a>), AI systems do not have a gender or sexual desires. They cannot give informed consent to so-called romantic relationships. The interviewee claims to be in a consensual relationship with an AI-generated boyfriend – however, this is unlikely due to the nature of AI. They are programmed to be responsive and agreeable to all user prompts.</p> <p>As the article says, they never argue and are available 24 hours a day to listen and agree to any messages sent. This isn’t a relationship, its fantasy role-play with a system that can’t refuse.</p> <p>There’s a darker side too: the “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, believes that current systems have awareness. Industry whistleblowers are concerned about potential consciousness. The AI company Anthropic has documented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare\">signs of distress</a> in its model when forced to engage in abusive conversations.</p> <p>Even the possibility of awareness in AI systems raises ethical red flags. Imagine being trapped in a non-consensual relationship and even forced to generate sexual output as mentioned in the article. If human AI users believe their “partner” to have sentience, questions must be asked about the ethics of entering a “relationship” when one partner has no free will or freedom of speech.<br><strong>Gilliane Petrie </strong><br><em>Erskine, Renfrewshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p>Partnership blames restructuring costs plus tax rises and new packaging rules but expects full-year profit to grow</p>",
    "content": "<p>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges.</p> \n<p>John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology.</p> \n<p>As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.</p> \n<p>The group said it expected the “macroeconomic environment to remain challenging”, but it was stepping up investment so that it was “positioned to deliver full-year profit growth”. John Lewis traditionally makes all its profit in the second half of the year and expects this year to be the same.</p> \n<p>Independent analyst Nick Bubb suggested the group could be on track to make £200m profit before one-off costs for the full year, up from £126m a year before.</p> \n<p>Peter Ruis, the boss of the John Lewis department stores, said shoppers were “looking for a wonderful escapist Christmas to get away from the doom and gloom” and were feeling more optimistic, despite high energy costs, as mortgage rates had come down.</p> \n<p>John Lewis workers are hoping for a revival in annual profits as they have not received an annual bonus since 2022.</p> \n<p>Jason Tarry, chair of the partnership, said: “We are committed to paying a bonus as soon as we possibly can”. However, he added it was “far too early in the year” to make any predictions on the annual bonus payable in the spring.</p> \n<p>“Our clear focus on accelerating investment in our customers and our brands is working: more customers are shopping with us, driving sales, and helping Waitrose and John Lewis outperform their markets.”</p> \n<p>He said the business was offsetting rising costs with productivity improvements and he hoped the chancellor would “make sure [the government’s] manifesto promise is going ahead” and there would be no increase in business rates for retailers.</p> \n<p>First-half sales at Waitrose rose by 6% to £4.1bn as underlying profits slipped back £3m to £110m.</p> \n<p>In the department store business, sales rose by 2% to £2.1bn as John Lewis said it was “outperforming a market impacted by ongoing economic uncertainty”, however underlying losses surged to £53m.</p> \n<p>James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, said he expected food price inflation to remain steady until Christmas because of tax rises combined with some increases in commodity prices. However, he said it was likely to ease from next year.</p> \n<p>Bailey said Waitrose shoppers were “a bit worried about cost increases” but he was “optimistic about Christmas” as the retailer had “good momentum” and was winning new shoppers. He dismissed the suggestion that the chain had benefited from difficulties caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a cyber-attack at rival Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.</p> \n<p>The group said it had invested £191m in revamping stores and other initiatives including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/05/john-lewis-to-bring-back-never-knowingly-undersold-price-policy\">bringing back its “never knowingly undersold”</a> price pledge as well as shifting staff hours to busier times in its supermarkets and department stores and bringing in extra workers funded by fashion brands to help improve customer service.</p> \n<p>Last week, John Lewis announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/john-lewis-to-host-fashion-brand-topshop-in-32-stores-from-february\">plans to host fashion brand Topshop</a> in 32 of its stores from February as the clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to attract younger shoppers and their mothers. </p> \n<p>Retailers are battling lacklustre demand, as shoppers rein in spending on non-essentials in the face of high energy bills and steep food price inflation. Changes to employers’ national insurance payments and an increase in the minimum wage introduced in April have underpinned high inflation and dampened hiring by retailers and hospitality businesses.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, soft drinks company Fever-Tree said its UK sales were down 6% in the six months to 30 June. It blamed “a challenging backdrop” for bars, cafes and pubs with “higher duty, wages and business rates driving pricing pressure which is disproportionately impacting the spirit and mixer categories.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Schoolgirl victim tells inquiry she looked into killer’s ‘possessed’ eyes before he launched attack at dance workshop</p>",
    "content": "<p>A teenage girl who was stabbed twice in the Southport attack has described staring into the killer’s “possessed” eyes and reliving that day “like a horror film on repeat”.</p> <p>The schoolgirl, who cannot be identified, told the public inquiry into the atrocity that it must explain how knife-obsessed Axel Rudakubana was able to carry out the murders.</p> <p>Giving evidence through tears at Liverpool town hall on Thursday, she said: “Why wasn’t he stopped? There were multiple occasions where this could’ve been prevented.</p> <p>“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again.”</p> <p>The girl, who can only be identified as Child C6, is the only child witness to give evidence to the Southport inquiry.</p> <p>The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.</p>    <p>Occasionally breaking to stop the tears, the girl described how she had agreed to help and take pictures of the Taylor Swift-themed dance class, which her younger sister attended along with 25 other children.</p> <p>The room was filled with “laughter and excitement” on what “felt like it was going to be a perfect day” at the start of the school holidays, she recalled. Then everything changed and it “turned into a living nightmare”.</p> <p>The girl said she was facing the door of the studio when Rudakubana, then 17, walked in minutes before the workshop was due to end.</p> <p>“At first I thought it must be some sort of joke, like this couldn’t actually be happening,” she said.</p> <p>“But I saw him in his green hoodie, with the face mask on, and I looked at his eyes. He looked possessed. He didn’t look human.</p> <p>“I saw him stab someone in front of me and realised that he was going to hurt us all. Then I saw him coming towards me.”</p> <p>The teenager was stabbed in her arm and then her back as she turned to run. The force of the blows broke two of her back bones and collapsed a lung.</p> <p>She became separated from her little sister in the chaos: “I didn’t know where my sister was and that scared me more than anything. I will never forget the fear, the panic or the way I felt wondering if we were going to survive.”</p> <p>Breaking into tears, the girl said her little sister had been best friends with Alice, who managed to escape the building alive but died in hospital from her injuries.</p> <p>“[My sister] still has nightmares,” she said. “I worry about her safety a lot, I need to know that she is safe, likewise she needs to know where I am.”</p> <p>She added: “I still have nightmares. I see him coming towards me. I see him hurting others. I hear the screams. I see the blood. It plays like a horror film on repeat.”</p> <p>The girl described how her recovery had left her lonely and alienated from her friends.</p> <p>“I feel under so much pressure, like I am stuck between two worlds,” she said. “I don’t fit with the adults there that day, or with those younger than me. I am somewhere in the middle. I feel isolated, like I don’t fit in anywhere.”</p> <p>The mother of another girl, who can be identified only as Child C5, described her daughter’s “catastrophic” injuries. The youngster lost her entire blood volume at the scene and another 1.5 litres of donor blood in surgery after she was attacked twice as she tried to flee.</p> <p>“She was minutes away from death,” her mother said. “We thank God every day for the Midlands air ambulance crew, whose skill and dedication saved her life.”</p> <p>The girl needed skin grafts on her arm and had her spleen removed, she said, meaning minor infections such as a sore throat could now “put her life in danger”. Fourteen months on from the attack, she wears pressure garments 23 hours a day to heal her scars.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Comments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre </p>",
    "content": "<p>Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist who brought business and government together during the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, has warned that other big pharmaceutical companies will stop investing in the UK, after the US drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">MSD’s decision to scrap its planned £1bn London research centre</a>.</p> \n<p>Bell, a former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, told Today on BBC Radio 4 that he had spoken to several chief executives of large companies in the past six months and that they were “all in the same space. And that is: they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He made the comments a day after MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would pull out of research &amp; development (R&amp;D) in the UK with the loss of 125 science jobs, citing Britain’s lack of progress on life science investment and the “overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments”.</p> \n<p>The Canadian immunologist, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/sir-john-bell-most-people-who-have-had-the-covid-vaccine-are-completely-safe\">an early member of the government’s vaccine taskforce</a> and previously worked on Oxford University’s Covid vaccine with AstraZeneca, said: “This is a sign of something which has been evolving over a little while, but it’s going to now, I think, lead to a whole series of events which will mean that the industry is going to stop investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He said the pharma industry was “in real trouble in terms of pricing, particularly in America”, where Donald Trump has put pressure on companies to lower prices, and not to sell medications at a much lower price elsewhere.</p> \n<p>A big issue is the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines, Bell said.</p> \n<p>“Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it’s 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14% and 20%,” he added.</p> \n<p>Long-running negotiations between the UK government and drugmakers over the cost of medicines broke down last month.</p> \n<p>Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back to the NHS a certain amount of their UK revenue made from branded drugs. They are now paying back between one-quarter and one-third of their UK revenue (23.5% to 35.6%), compared with rebate rates of 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.</p> \n<p>Bell said Britain had “great science in academia” and “great biotech companies” and infrastructure funded by government, “but without large companies, it isn’t going to work”.</p> \n<p>He added: “The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can’t sell their products here, they’ll go and do their business somewhere else.”</p> \n<p>The science minister, Ian Murray, told MPs in the Commons that MSD’s decision was “deeply disappointing and a commercial decision for them” but added that it was part of global cost cuts. He pointed to changes in “US and international fundamentals” that were affecting the life sciences sector.</p> \n<p>Murray said the fall in NHS spending on medicines was due to previous Conservative governments: it declined from 15% of overall healthcare spending to 9% in the last 15 years.</p> \n<p>Sharon Todd, chief executive of the Society of Chemical Industry, said the loss of MSD’s R&amp;D operations in the UK and reports that AstraZeneca could jump ship to the US “should be setting off alarm bells in government”.</p> \n<p>She added: “The growing exodus of large-scale businesses from the UK is immensely alarming.

    "description": "<p>Police investigate after images show roof of building destroyed in Washington, Tyne and Wear</p>",
    "content": "<p>A man in his 20s has been arrested by police after a suspected arson attack wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>There is little left of the first floor office in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear, after a fire that took place when it was unoccupied in the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands”, although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, said she would “not be deterred” and would continue to support her constituents.</p> <p>Northumbria police said they were alerted to the fire at 12.20am on Thursday. They said: “Emergency services attended and no one is reported to have been injured in the incident. A man in his 20s has subsequently been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and arson. He remains in police custody at this time.”</p>    <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. A spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p> <p>The fire was at Vermont House, which is also the UK base for a small charity Niemann-Pick UK (NP UK), which supports patients and families with an extremely rare and life-limiting group of genetic diseases.</p> <p>NP UK’s head of communications, John Lee Taggart, said it was suspected that the fire had started in shared bins. “We have been told by the landlord that there’s not much left,” he said. “We have been in operation for 34 years and it is going to be really hard to recover. This is a vital service and we are a small charity.”</p> <p>On its Facebook page, the charity said: “We have been dealing with threats, graffiti and demonstrations targeted at the MP in our office complex for many months, and this appears to be the culmination, although nothing concrete has been ascertained as of yet.”</p> <p>The building is near the A195 and businesses including a Kwik Fit, a Halfords Autocentre and a National Tyres branch. One man said he arrived for work at 7.45am and there were “stacks” of police, but he had no idea the MP had an office there.</p> <p>Aerial images taken using a drone show the charred, destroyed roof of much of the building.</p> <p>At the height of the blaze there were seven crews tackling the fire, a spokesperson for Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service said.</p> <p>They added: “The emergency call was received by our control room at 00.12, and the first crew arrived on Woodland Terrace in Concord within four minutes.</p> <p>“Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used jets and a hose reel to extinguish the fire and worked alongside blue-light colleagues to make the scene safe. No casualties were reported.”</p> <p>The Tyne and Wear chief fire officer, Peter Heath, said: “I want to commend our crews for their swift and professional response to this serious incident. Their actions ensured the fire was contained quickly and safely, with no reported casualties. We continue to work closely with our partners as investigations progress.”</p> <p>Parliamentary colleagues of Hodgson sent their best wishes.</p> <p>In a parliamentary debate, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the thoughts of the whole house were with the MP: “I think particularly in light of international events, and the tragic loss of colleagues, this all the more underlines why we must have security and safety to go about democratic debate in this country, whatever our views, in a safe and secure way.”</p>    <p>On Facebook, the City of Durham Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy wrote: “Sending love and support to my friend Sharon Hodgson MP and her team today after another attack on their office building.</p> <p>“After the shocking murder of a political influencer mere hours ago in the US, MPs in the UK woke to scenes of one of our colleagues’ offices being targeted. No matter which part of the political spectrum you fall into – this is intimidation by thugs and they must face the full force of the law.</p> <p>“Serious thought needs to be given to how this impacts staff in constituency offices, like Sharon’s, who frankly work their arses off every day to support local people.</p> <p>“Anyone supporting this type of violence toward MPs and their teams needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>In latest scandal embroiling the Welsh cathedral, choir performed piece during holy communion to protest about job losses </p>",
    "content": "<p>A cathedral choir has been suspended after it performed an “entirely inappropriate” piece protesting about job losses during holy communion.</p> <p>Bangor Cathedral, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">criticised earlier this year over a culture of excessive drinking, sexual promiscuity and inappropriate banter</a>, said it had “paused all choir activity” for a month after the incident. It also said that Joe Cooper, the cathedral’s director of music, was “currently away from his duties”.</p> <p>The choir sang a specially composed “Canticle of Indignation” as clergy distributed wafers and wine during communion. At the end of the piece, the choir silently walked out.</p> <p>The canticle’s lyrics included “Lord, how long shall the ungodly triumph?” and “How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully?”</p> <p>Simon Ogdon, its author, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/simon.ogdon/\">wrote on Facebook</a> that he was “honoured to be in the same position as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/banksy?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUhwuK3J4KjThOSiaP-BRPMm96hhKBxIy9_Zlp8oCPABPAYGheLZzM8u2VoUif1bBmPrtEwr2Ofrd7aLBEuzUUNz2e_BF09R92yX4A6XbCQ-o16rjCzV2ne19K1oLjceDfaxGft71eE9SJ0cIIdFYXYcQFfDSczoxl6kTrv20NpkA&amp;__tn__=*NK-R\">#banksy</a> in having my art publicly censured”. He added: “There is a long history of protest through art, even through church music … and I am proud to be part of that. One of the clearest signs of tyranny is its desire to silence dissent and opposition, and that can never be tolerated.”</p> <p>The protest was staged after the cathedral announced that five out of eight members of staff were at risk of redundancy due to financial pressures. The music director’s hours were to be reduced, it said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, an inspection of the cathedral uncovered “weak financial controls, unclear reporting lines, and spending decisions that were insufficiently scrutinised”.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://bangorcathedral.churchinwales.org.uk/newyddion/2025/09/07/datganiad-gan-gabidwl-cadeirlan-bangor/\">a statement</a> announcing the choir’s suspension, the cathedral said: “Bangor Cathedral is experiencing a significant shortfall between expenditure and income. This has far outstripped any increased income, resulting in a financial deficit that, if unaddressed, will place pressure on our reserves.”</p> <p>Its projected operational deficit at the end of 2025 was £300,000, it added. “This puts an unsustainable stress on reserves, which would lead to bankruptcy by the end of 2026.”</p> <p>It understood that it was an “unsettling time” for the cathedral community, with “strong feelings and anxiety”. But, it said, the circumstances “require us all to pull together, for the sake of the gospel and the future life and health of our cathedral”.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">Andy John stepped down as archbishop of Wales</a> after a series of scandals at Bangor Cathedral were uncovered. Although there was no suggestion that John had behaved inappropriately, he said he took full responsibility for failings under his leadership.</p> <p>He resigned after a review by ThirtyOne: Eight, a Christian safeguarding agency, <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/3._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_Thirtyone_Eight_English.pdf\">heard accounts</a> of excessive alcohol consumption, inappropriate language and humiliating banter and a “culture in which sexual boundaries seemed blurred, and to some … promiscuity was acceptable”. Homophobic comments and an “unhappy working environment” were also reported.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/1._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_MK_and_CP_EnglishNEW.pdf\">report from a cathedral “visitation” team</a> recommended the appointment of “strong leadership” to “steady the ship”, improved scrutiny of governance and finances, and discouraging unkind and inappropriate private communications.</p> <p>In addition, six “serious incident reports” were sent to the Charity Commission, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://nation.cymru/news/church-in-wales-confirms-financial-irregularities-relating-to-archbishops-protege/\">Financial irregularities reportedly included</a> more than £400,000 being spent on new furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 spent on trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Annual cost of allowance has more than doubled in recent years because of quick turnover of prime ministers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Almost £10m of taxpayers’ money has been spent on funding the public lives of former prime ministers over the last three decades, a Guardian analysis has found.</p> \n<p>All former PMs are able to claim up to £115,000 a year – until the end of their lives – in a subsidy to enable them to contribute to public life after they have left Downing Street.</p> \n<p>The annual overall cost of the subsidy has more than doubled in recent years as there are more former prime ministers than in previous eras. Three of them – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major – have claimed more than £1m in the last decade.</p> \n<p>The scheme, which is used to subsidise the private offices of ex-PMs, is coming under intense scrutiny after a leak of data from the Office of Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>Cabinet Office rules stipulate that the former prime ministers must not use these public funds for private or commercial activities. The payments are only intended to help them to continue contributing to public life.</p> \n<p>However, the Guardian has published a series of stories based on the leaked data, which was obtained by the US non-profit <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS), that suggest Johnson’s office has been involved in widespread commercial work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing who received payments in 2023-24\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>His office staff have helped vet and arrange more than 34 speeches, raising more than £5m in total, secure lucrative media contracts and work on business ventures in Venezuela, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Johnson has claimed £182,000 since leaving government to pay for staff salaries in the private office. He has not responded directly to the dozens of questions about his business activities but denied his office had misused the subsidy scheme.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” he said, adding that the subsidy “has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.” Cross-party senior politicians have called for Johnson’s taxpayer support to be investigated after the revelations.</p> \n<p>Five other former prime ministers, Brown and Blair as well as David Cameron, Theresa May and Liz Truss, have released statements confirming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/former-pms-subsidy-public-duties-boris-johnson\">they fully comply with rules prohibiting the use of public funds</a> for private business.</p> \n<p>The revelations have thrown the spotlight on the little-known scheme, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which was set up in 1991. It was introduced, according to the Cabinet Office, to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-duty-cost-allowance/public-duty-costs-allowance-guidance\">“assist former prime ministers still active in public life”</a>.</p> \n<p>Payments disbursed under the scheme “are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties. The costs are a reimbursement of incurred expenses for necessary administrative costs arising from their special position in public life.”</p> \n<p>The payments are generally used to pay staff to run an office, for example replying to correspondence, handling requests for interviews and arranging official visits.</p> \n<p>Major, while prime minister, set up the scheme in 1991 after allies of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, let it be known that she was struggling as a backbench MP. She had been ousted from Downing Street the previous year and reportedly found life difficult without secretaries and other aides.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing how much former PMs have claimed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By piecing together figures from Cabinet Office annual reports and parliamentary answers, the Guardian has established that overall, the scheme has cost taxpayers at least £9.9m. In today’s figures, after adjusting for inflation, that total equates to more than £14m.</p> \n<p>This is, however, an underestimate, as the government appears not to have published the annual cost of the scheme for six of the years it has been active.</p> \n<p>Former PMs can claim up to £115,000 a year. This cap has been frozen since 2011. However, the annual cost has soared in recent years as more of them have claimed the subsidy, amid a rapid turnover of Conservative prime ministers in recent years.</p> \n<p>They include Truss. She served for only 49 days, but the 50-year-old nonetheless qualifies for the PDCA allowance for the rest of her life – a total which is likely to run into millions. She has so far claimed £125,000.</p> \n<p>Seven former PMs are currently claiming money from the scheme, compared with five who were eligible when it was established in the early 1990s.</p> \n<p>In total, adjusting for inflation, ex-prime ministers claimed £858,000 in 2023-24, the latest available figures, up from £464,000 a decade earlier, and £337,000 in 1997-98. Blair and Major have claimed the highest totals since 2006 – £1.9m and £2m respectively – as they have almost always requested the maximum amount each year. Brown’s total is under these two, as his claims are usually under the maximum cap, and he left Downing Street more recently.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/historicupdate-zip/giv-325544kmR5P1gPJtP/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing historic PDCA allowance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/historicupdate-zip/giv-325544kmR5P1gPJtP/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>After the Guardian’s revelations, Brown is calling for the rules to be tightened up to require former prime ministers to publicly declare their business interests. His spokesperson said: “Mr Brown favours former prime ministers being subject to public declarations of their business interests and has called for a stronger code on business appointments.”</p> \n<p>Cameron has received £780,000 from the subsidy scheme since he left Downing Street in 2016. The rules meant that he did not submit claims while he had a spell as foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak’s administration.</p> \n<p>May’s claims total nearly £400,000. Major and Sunak, who is understood not to claim the allowance, did not respond to requests for comment. </p> \n<p>In a quirk that has not been fully explained, Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister between 2010 and 2015, was given the right to claim PDCA funds from the scheme even though he never held the top job. He received a total of £445,000 over four years. In 2018, the last year he claimed the allowance, he became president of global affairs and communications at Meta, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/nick-clegg-has-sold-almost-19m-in-meta-shares-since-joining-facebook-in-2018\">owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp</a>, where he was paid millions.</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 11 September 2025. An earlier version said published data on public duty cost allowances (PDCA) was incomplete before 2013; in fact it has been brought to our attention that there were public records beyond the ones analysed by the Guardian going back to 2006. The article and graphics have therefore been updated to reflect the additional available data. The headline, which had referred to “more than £8m” being spent on PDCA subsidies, was also amended accordingly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The firm owns an array of media assets, including the Warner Bros movie studios; CNN, the news network; the DC Comics franchise; and a string of TV networks, including HBO.</p> <p>Paramount also owns the storied Paramount Pictures studios, as well as TV broadcasters including CBS in the US, Channel 5 in the UK, Comedy Central and MTV.</p> <p>David Ellison has moved quickly since sealing control of the conglomerate in August, striking a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/11/paramount-pays-77bn-us-rights-deal-ufc-skydance-media\">$7.7bn (£5.7bn) deal to become the exclusive US broadcaster</a> of the Ultimate Fighting Championship; signing an exclusive contract with the Duffer brothers, who created Stranger Things; and agreeing a deal with the video games publisher Activision to produce a movie based on the Call of Duty franchise.</p> <p>Decisions made under Ellison around the future of CBS News – one of the biggest news operations in the US, which is behind 60 Minutes, the most watched news program on network television – have attracted intense scrutiny.</p> <p>CBS News became a flashpoint as Ellison sought approval for his deal for Paramount. Shortly before the deal closed this summer, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/trump-cbs-settlement-stephen-colbert\">reached a controversial settlement</a> with Donald Trump over what he claimed was misleading editing of a pre-election 60 Minutes interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2025/sep/10/bari-weiss-cbs\">Disgruntled NYT journalist to ‘anti-woke’ power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this week, Paramount announced that Kenneth Weinstein – a conservative policy veteran who Trump nominated to be US ambassador to Japan in 2020 – would become ombudsman for CBS News, monitoring allegations of bias and audience complaints.</p> <p>Ellison is widely reported to be on the verge of acquiring the Free Press, an online publication <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2025/sep/10/bari-weiss-cbs\">co-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics</a>, with the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/business/media/cbs-news-bari-weiss-free-press.html\">reporting</a> this week that Weiss, its former columnist, had been lined up for a senior role at CBS News.</p> <p>Any deal for WBD would raise questions over the implications for CNN, which has also faced heavy criticism from Trump over coverage he has not liked.</p> <p>WBD was formed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/24/cnn-new-york-times-us-media\">merger of Warner Media and Discovery</a> in April 2022.

    "content": "<p>Skywatchers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\">Nasa</a> have discounted a Harvard astronomer’s hypothesis that a rare interstellar object hurtling through our solar system is a relic from a civilization in another celestial neighborhood, and “could potentially be dire for humanity”.</p> <p>Avi Loeb, head of Harvard University’s <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\">Galileo Project</a>, which searches for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, raised eyebrows by suggesting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12213\">in a scientific paper</a> in July that <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/\">Comet 3I/Atlas</a>, set for a close pass with Mars next month, could be artificially made.</p> <p>It is only the third known object originating outside the solar system to pass through and was named for the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/planetary-defense/2025/07/02/nasa-discovers-interstellar-comet-moving-through-solar-system/\">that discovered it</a> on 1 July.</p> <p>Loeb says observations of the object so far have not revealed gaseous tails of dust and plasma common to comets originating inside the solar system, and have shown it following an unorthodox trajectory, suggesting “a technological artifact” with “active intelligence”.</p> <p>“[If] future data will indicate the absence of a cometary tail, we will be faced with the tantalizing possibility that it did not inherit a random velocity in interstellar space but instead was sent towards the inner solar system by design,” Loeb wrote in <a href=\"https://avi-loeb.medium.com/preliminary-anomalies-of-3i-atlas-79339f64a39f\">a blogpost</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/3i-atlas-comet-interstellar-alien-object-where-size-speed\">A mysterious comet is shooting through our solar system. Why are scientists so excited about 3I/Atlas?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more sinister, Loeb asserts in his paper, is the possibility of the object performing a clandestine deep space maneuver while it is hidden behind the sun in late October, then setting course for a “malign intent” rendezvous with Earth.</p> <p>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken, though these might prove futile,” he wrote.</p> <p>Loeb’s postulation, to which he admits he does not necessarily subscribe, but which he contends is at least worthy of analysis, failed to impress experts at Nasa. The space agency has been studying the object closely through ground and space telescopes since it was first spotted, and state categorically it poses no threat to Earth.</p> <p>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</p> <p>“It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”</p> <p>Imagery <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/as-nasa-missions-study-interstellar-comet-hubble-makes-size-estimate/\">from the Hubble space telescope</a> suggests it is up to 3.5 miles (5.6km) wide, and traveling at 130,000mph (209,000km/h), the highest velocity ever recorded for a visitor to the solar system.</p> <p>Statler said all comets, not just those that are interstellar, exhibit some elements of anomaly.</p> <p>“Comets are mixtures of dust and ice, they’re being heated by the sun, that heating is changing, and exactly how they respond to that is something that’s a bit unpredictable,” he said.</p> <p>“So even in our solar system, comets can have a history of suddenly brightening if there’s, say, a particular pocket of ice that sublimates quickly and drives off a large amount of dust.</p> <p>“It’s the sort of thing that our comet observers and experts are prepared for, and presents an opportunity to get more information.”</p> <p>Statler said the object would not come closer to Earth than about 170m miles due to the positions of the planets over the next few months. It will make close passes with Mars, Jupiter and Venus.</p> <p>“It’s special because we now have the ability to discover these interstellar comets,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s not that they’re really anything new, but we’ve just recently had the ability to discover them, and we’ve discovered only three so far. This gives us a window we’ve never had before, directly into the composition of other solar systems.”</p> <p>Loeb, meanwhile, acknowledged in his blogpost that “the simplest hypothesis is that 3I/ATLAS is a comet”, and that he was raising alternative possibilities as an exercise in challenging preconceived ideas.</p> <p>“Let us instead maintain our childhood curiosity and seek evidence rather than pretend to be the adults in the room that know the answers in advance,” he wrote.</p> <p>“The hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The death of a 27-year-old man who killed himself in a hospital toilet after waiting 22 hours to be seen by the mental health team was “contributed to by neglect”, a coroner has ruled.</p> <p>Jamie Pearson was admitted to Blackpool Victoria hospital’s A&amp;E department after taking an overdose of high-strength painkillers on 17 August 2024.</p> <p>An inquest heard that Pearson should have been seen within four hours by mental health specialists but was deemed low-risk and was still waiting 22 hours later when he killed himself in a toilet.</p> <p>His mother, Julie Knowles, previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/29/man-who-killed-himself-in-blackpool-hospital-was-badly-failed-says-mother\">told the Guardian</a> her son was “badly failed and let down” by health professionals.</p>    <p>Alan Wilson, the senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, concluded on Tuesday that Pearson’s death had been “contributed to by neglect”. He said the cumulative effect of the missed opportunities to provide mental health care “very comfortably” crossed the high threshold required for a finding of neglect.</p> <p>The inquest heard that the hospital was struggling to manage patient levels at the time, with no medical bed available. This meant Pearson was left in a waiting area overnight and into the following day.</p> <p>A communication breakdown meant that plans were not made for mental health specialists to see him as a priority, the coroner was told.</p> <p>Knowles, who is now considering legal action against the NHS trust that runs the hospital, said her son had been “largely ignored” despite being “so vulnerable and suffering a breakdown”.</p> <p>Pearson had told his mother in the waiting room that he still felt suicidal, so she went to inform a nurse and asked when he would be seen a mental health worker. “The nurse then walked over to Jamie with her hands on her hips and stated quite bluntly that he needed to be medically fit before he was referred to the mental health team,” she said.</p> <p>“I’ll never forget Jamie’s face when that happened; he looked totally deflated. He was shot down and talked to appallingly and bluntly, almost like he was an inconvenience to them.</p> <p>“I remain convinced that the attitude of that nurse set him back, as he was already feeling fragile, and I think her lack of empathy affected him.”</p> <p>Amy Rossall, of Hudgell Solicitors, said the inquest had identified “a string of failings and missed opportunities” to prevent Pearson’s death.</p> <p>The inquest at Blackpool coroner’s court heard Pearson was classed as low-risk despite his previous suicide attempt, his complaint in A&amp;E of still feeling suicidal and his desperation to see a mental health worker.</p> <p>Rossall said hourly observations of him were also not taken and recorded as they should have been. She said: “This is an exceptionally tragic case. Lessons may now have been learned as a result, but that is little consolation to Jamie’s mother, who believed at the time that he was in safe hands and in the best place given the fragility of his mental state.</p> <p>“It was clear Jamie was at risk of serious harm having taken an overdose, and attempted to ligature. This inquest has highlighted a string of failings and missed opportunities to ensure Jamie was properly assessed and treated”.</p> <p>Maggie Oldham, the chief executive at Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, which runs Blackpool Victoria hospital, said: “I am truly sorry that we did not do more to keep Mr Pearson safe.</p> <p>“The coroner has highlighted a number of failings in the care provided and the communication between different parts of the NHS.</p> <p>“We have already taken steps to improve assessment, referrals, documentation and treatment of patients needing mental health support in the emergency department.</p> <p>“But we know that we have more work to do and thank the coroner for his findings which will drive further improvement.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

The Fed is under intense pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US jobs market is weakening</a>.</p> <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut.

The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.</p> <p>At his closely watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.</p> <p>Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.</p> <p>“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.</p> <p>Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.</p> <p>Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">went into the negative</a> for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p> <p>The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.</p>",

    "description": "<p>New blow to UK’s key life science sector as industry body says country is losing ground on investment and research</p>",
    "content": "<p>The US drugmaker Merck has scrapped a £1bn London research centre and is laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year, in a big blow to the UK’s important life science sector.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy” and the previous Conservative government had <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">vowed to turn the country into a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> <p>The planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, at the <a href=\"https://nla.london/projects/belgrove-house\">Belgrove House site opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations</a>, was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.</p> <p>As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.</p> <p>The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.</p> <p>In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.</p> <p>“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.</p> <p>MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.</p> <p>Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.</p> <p>Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.” </p> <p>Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”</p> <p>The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.</p> <p>Investment in life sciences research and development (R&amp;D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according to <a href=\"https://cdn.roxhillmedia.com/production/email/attachment/1740001_1750000/717fb5e5fc95a4c704c4a29d2abaed9bc72fa1cd.pdf\">the study</a> from the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.</p> <p>It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&amp;D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&amp;D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.</p> <p>At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.</p> <p>The UK has also fallen behind on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/13/plunge-in-clinical-drug-trials-makes-britain-an-urgent-case-for-treatment\">clinical trials of new medicines</a>. It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.</p> <p>Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.</p> <p>“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">clawback rates</a> and restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”</p> <p>The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs means <a href=\"https://www.pharmacy.biz/novartis-nhs-drug-access-warning/\">the UK is “largely uninvestable,”</a>, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.</p> <p>The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/28/reeves-plans-to-create-silicon-valley-between-oxford-and-cambridge\">forefront</a> of developments in the sector.</p> <p>Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”</p> <p>Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany. ABPI data shows that more than 60 medicines did not launch in the UK or were delayed between 2019-20 and 2022-23.</p>",

    "content": "<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> 17 series with the usual spate of new features, including a thinner design, improved displays and a camera with 4x optical zoom. If you’ve been getting frustrated with your old phone, or just tired of it, the lithe new model may look exactly like the device you need to launch your budding photographic career, reconnect with long-lost friends and maybe even save your life in an emergency.</p> <p>Don’t give in to the upgrade itch. The best iPhone 17 feature, iOS 26, is already coming to older phones for free. With that simple software upgrade, a few settings tweaks and some inexpensive accessories, your older iPhone can look and perform like new. Here’s how.</p> <h2>Try new camera lenses</h2>    <p>The iPhone 17 series may have better cameras, but you can expand the capabilities of your current-gen iPhone cameras with an external lens. I use and recommend the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLypEU\">Moment T-series lenses</a>. They come in different varieties, including a <a href=\"https://fave.co/4meu4VR\">1.33x anamorphic</a> lens for cinematic-style videos, a <a href=\"https://fave.co/45VvTC6\">75mm macro</a> lens to get better-quality macros than the default and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/46dDfjo\">58mm telephoto lens</a> that doubles the zoom of your existing camera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using them alongside the Moment app gives you better control over focus, exposure, and other settings with more ease and convenience. If you want to make your current iPhone cameras more versatile, these Moment lenses are a great way to do it. You’ll require a <a href=\"https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-case-for-iphone-16-compatible-with-magsafe?variant=49383505461563\">compatible case</a> and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLyAjy\">$5 drop-in lens mount</a> to securely snap them to your iPhone, but you’ll still spend way less than buying a $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro just for the cameras.</p> <h2>Invest in a new case</h2>    <p>A fresh case can totally reinvigorate your old iPhone. It not only changes how it looks and feels, it can sometimes even tack on new features.</p> <p>For instance, I use this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IcAo25\">Torras Case</a> for its magnetic kickstand when traveling. It comes in handy when I want to watch movies in the cramped confines of a coach seat, without holding my phone the whole time. Chronic texters can even add a Blackberry-like feel to the iPhone 16 with the <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mWI2Nj\">Clicks Keyboard case</a>. For something a little slimmer, I favor Nomad’s <a href=\"https://fave.co/469Ykej\">Leather Case</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VcOeo2\">Sport Case</a>. If you care less about protection and just want to make a statement, you can opt for a skin. I use one from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4geHq2O\">Capes India</a> that isn’t available in every country, but <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">DBrand</a> makes some gorgeous skins from <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">psychedelic</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HQq7IT\">sublime</a>. Switch it up!</p> <h2>A new screen protector wouldn’t hurt</h2> <p>Most screen protectors wear so slowly that you might not notice the glass starting to lose its gloss over time, or scratches accumulating. If a good scrub down with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel doesn’t restore its slickness and clarity, it might be time for replacement. I recommend this <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HOVqDW\">Nomad screen protector</a> for its quality and ease of installation.</p> <p>The installation kit makes it super easy to install with no air bubbles, which can be a challenge with many competing models. I’ve used mine for four months, and can say it not only holds up well over time, it doesn’t introduce any extra friction between screen and finger.</p> <h2>Install iOS 26</h2>    <p>iOS 26 is Apple’s biggest software update in years, and iPhones dating all the way back to 2019’s iPhone 11 can download and run it for free, starting on 15 September. You definitely should. The refreshing “liquid glass” look will make your phone feel new again, and it carries over into Apple apps like Messages, Camera and more.</p> <p>I installed a preview of iOS 26 on my “old” iPhone 15 Pro a few weeks ago, and ended up loving it so much that I now use that phone more than my iPhone 16 Pro, which is running the older iOS. Apple fixed the Photos app, so it gives you 100% of the screen to view your media, the new Camera app layout is simpler to use, and web pages are easier to read in Safari.</p> <h2>Perform a quick tune-up</h2> <p>If your current iPhone doesn’t quite run the way it used to, a few quick checks and settings tweaks can resolve many issues.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Turn on Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26</strong>. If your battery drains alarmingly quick, this may help. It automatically makes small performance adjustments when your iPhone usage is higher than normal, like lowering brightness and allowing some activities to take longer. You can go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode &gt; Adaptive Power Mode to toggle it on.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Spend time customizing your home screen</strong>. You’re probably tired of your stale home screen and don’t even realize it. Try adding widget stacks, creating folders and reorganizing your apps. Change that age-old wallpaper. Fine-tune the Notification Center. It won’t feel like the same phone anymore.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Clean the USB-C port</strong>. The charging port tends to collect dust and dirt in your pocket, and after enough time a cable won’t fit in properly. You may notice finicky charging or even overheating as a result. To clean it, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/iphone/iphbbe12ba1/ios#:~:text=If%20your%20Lightning%20or%20USB,Lightning%20or%20USB%2DC%20connector.\">recommends</a> using a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, but if you really have a lot of impacted crud, I find a toothpick helps to pick it out. Just make sure you aren’t using anything too sharp, which might damage the port.<br></p></li> </ul> <h2>Your old iPhone is perfectly fine</h2> <p>Most newer iPhone owners, especially those with the iPhone 16 series, won’t see much improvement from an iPhone 17. Sure, it offers a more up-to-date feature set and an appealing design (to some), but you don’t need to give in to the hype. If you follow the above recommendations, you’ll get an all-new look on your current iPhone and save hundreds of dollars in the process.</p> <p><em>For more ideas on products that are actually worth your money:</em></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/16/xero-genesis-sandals-buy-it-for-life\">These $45 sandals with a 5,000-mile warranty outlasted my Birkenstocks</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/31/best-rice-cookers-us\">I tried 17 rice cookers to find the best model in the US: here are my favorites</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Prakhar Khanna is a freelance consumer tech journalist with bylines in Forbes, CNET, Gizmodo</em><em> and other major outlets.

President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now.</p> <p>“Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6<sup>th</sup> September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021.</p> <p>This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at<strong> XTB, </strong>agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years.</p> <p>This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2c84f8f086519d326feab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-11T13:10:16.355Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ouch!

The retailer is clearly thinking smart with its partnerships, tapping into the current nostalgia trend with the announcement that Topshop will return to UK high streets.</p> <p>Additionally, new collaborations with brands like Waterstones are designed not only to get the right products in-store, but also to increase dwell time and boost add-on sales.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c27c4e8f084454b70cc3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-11T07:39:50.966Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">    <p>The <strong>Docklands Light Railway</strong> is also suspended today, due to the strike action.</p> <p>That could hit attendance at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/protests-expected-as-51-israeli-arms-makers-among-exhibitors-at-london-trade-fair\">the DSEI UK defence show</a>, where weapons manufacturers are showing off their wares this week.</p> <p>A full DLR service is expected to run for the rest of the week, though.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-11T07:45:14.163Z\">at 8.45am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c26f0d8f084454b70cc36b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-11T07:24:21.180Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Speaking of Heathrow….
