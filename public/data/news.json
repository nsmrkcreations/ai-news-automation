I would not be able to take all of the belongings and supplies I have already bought several times before,” Sahweil said. “Then there is the suffering we would face in searching for water and the lack of empty spaces to stay in. So if I leave, I would simply be going into the unknown.”</p> <p>Like more than 90% of people in <strong>Gaza</strong>, the family has been displaced by the war. An overwhelming majority have been forced to move numerous times. Sahweil and her family have already been displaced 19 times.</p> <p>Now, with the launch of a ground offensive, the <strong>Israeli</strong> army is calling on the estimated 1 million people sheltering in Gaza City to move south once more. But Sahweil and her family, and many others, have been to the south before and are aware it is no haven from violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/running-from-death-to-death-gaza-city-residents-face-impossible-choice\">‘Running from death to death’: Gaza City residents face impossible choice</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68ca54898f0862eec18cf9af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T06:48:58.128Z\">7.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Israel announces  ‘temporary’ route for residents to flee Gaza City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Israel</strong> announced on Wednesday a “temporary” new route for residents to flee <strong>Gaza City</strong>, as it launched an intense ground offensive after massive bombardment of the <strong>Palestinian</strong> territory’s main city.</p> <p>The Israeli military “announces the opening of a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din street”, spokesperson <strong>Avichay Adraee</strong> said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Official Britain is laying out the red carpet for Donald Trump today. It is the first full day of his unprecedented state visit, and he will spend it with King Charles at Windsor Castle enjoying the finest pageantry the nation can lay on. Keir Starmer, like other Western leaders, has concluded that the key to getting positive outcomes from Trump is flattery and shameless sucking up, and (not for the first time) the royal family is being deployed to this end.</p> <p>But civic Britain will also have its say on Trump today, and – perhaps mindful of his obsession with big crowds and his (supposed) love for free speech – there will be <a href=\"https://stoptrump.org.uk/local-protests/\">protests all over the country</a>, with the main one in London. When Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president in the Trump’s first administration, was asked he felt about being booed one night when he attended the theatre, he said that was “the sound of freedom”. Trump’s response to protesters is much darker. But there is almost no chance of his hearing “the sound of freedom” today; his state visit is taking place entirely behind closed doors.</p> <p>I will be focusing largely on the state visit today, but I will be covering non-Trump UK politics too.</p> <p>Here is our overnight story about Trump arriving in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">Donald Trump lands in UK for second state visit as protesters gather in Windsor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is <strong>Rafael Behr</strong>’s Guardian about the potential flaws in Starmer’s obsequious approach to handling the US president.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-america-donald-trump-britain\">Keir Starmer is betting everything on an America that doesn’t exist any more | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an Rafael’s conclusion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master.

There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p> <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate?

They are not people on whose values and judgment Britain should be betting its future prosperity or national security.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the timetable for the day.</p> <p><em>11.55am:</em> Donald Trump arrives at Windsor Castle by helicopter.

    "description": "<p>Patrick Vallance says relations must improve and NHS has to reverse decline in drugs investment</p>",
    "content": "<p>The UK is determined to resolve its standoff with the pharmaceutical industry and reverse a 10-year decline in NHS spending on medicines, the science minister has told MPs after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/big-pharma-firms-uk-investment-trump-msd-eli-lilly-astrazeneca\">string of drugmakers cancelled projects worth nearly £2bn</a>.</p> <p>Patrick Vallance, a former executive at drugmaker GSK, said the country needed to increase spending on medicines and reverse a decade of declining investment.</p> <p>“We are determined to solve this,” Lord Vallance told the Commons science committee. “This is not something [where] we’re sitting saying let’s watch the decline of the industry. That’s what’s happened for the past 10 years. We must not do that. We have to act. Now is a pivotal moment … to try to get this right.”</p> <p>MPs called an emergency session in response to last week’s decision by the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">to scrap its plans for a £1bn London research centre</a> and lay off 125 scientists partly based at the capital’s Francis Crick Institute. MSD blamed “the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry”.</p> <p>AstraZeneca announced on Friday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/astrazeneca-pauses-200m-investment-in-cambridge-research-site\">it was putting a £200m new laboratory in Cambridge on hold</a>. It abandoned a £450m investment in its Speke vaccine site in January after months of negotiations, citing a cut in government support.</p>    <p>Vallance, who became a household name as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/patrick-vallance-chris-whitty-best-bits-covid\">chief scientific adviser during the Covid pandemic</a>, told MPs on Tuesday that the NHS’s spending on medicines had been in decline as a proportion of total healthcare spend since 2015, but said the figure would increase from the current 9%.</p> <p>“The reason we need to reverse that direction is not just price,” he said. “It’s about saying we need to make sure that we get rapid uptake of the best new medicines and we have equitable access right across the UK.”</p> <p>He said the UK’s drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which decides which medications will be available on the NHS, needed to be linked.</p> <p>Dr Zubir Ahmed, the new health under-secretary and a Scottish surgeon, said the UK needed to change its pricing models in recognition of new cutting-edge treatments, which are more expensive.</p> <p>“We have to look at medicines in a different light … and calculate the economic and clinical benefit on that basis,” he said.</p> <p>Vallance said the government had not formally restarted talks with the pharmaceutical industry over its medicine pricing mechanism, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">collapsed last month without an agreement</a> and has been cited as one of the factors in drugmakers cancelling projects, but ministers were holding “lots of discussions around the commercial environment in the UK” with companies.</p> <p>“We cannot afford to lose this industry from the UK,” he said. “It’s very important that we have two large global companies. That matters, that it’s two,” he said, referring to AstraZeneca and GSK.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, MPs heard from MSD’s UK head, Ben Lucas, who said it was a “sad day that we’re leaving because we valued our collaboration with the Crick”. The company also plans to close its animal health site in Milton Keynes and transfer the work to Austria.</p> <p>AstraZeneca’s UK president, Tom Keith-Roach, told MPs: “We are involved now in a highly constructive conversation with government at the highest level, notwithstanding that this is an extremely difficult moment in history and a very substantial challenge; the issue of under-investment in medicines has been a continued and worsening trend in the UK.”</p> <p>The head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Richard Torbett, said the UK was losing out to the US, Belgium, Ireland, Singapore and Germany.</p> <p>GSK laid out plans on Wednesday to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and supply chains in the US over the next five years, in an announcement timed to coincide with Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK. This includes $1.2bn of new money to build an AI-powered biologics factory in Pennsylvania that will develop treatments for the lung disease COPD and asthma, as well as cancer.</p> <p>GSK also reaffirmed its commitment to the UK. Its chief executive, Emma Walmsley, said: “Here in the UK, we continue to invest in a significant manufacturing base and more than £1.5bn in R&amp;D every year.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer said GSK’s US investment “will change lives on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>“It’s a powerful example of how UK–US collaboration is driving real-world impact – improving people’s health, creating opportunity and turbocharging growth,” he said.</p>",

He said some users “in some cases or countries” may also be asked to provide ID to verify their age.</p> <p>“We know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff.”</p> <p>How ChatGPT responds to accounts identified as being under 18 will change, Altman said. Graphic sexual content will be blocked. It will be trained to not flirt if asked by under-18 users, or engage in discussions about suicide or self-harm even in a creative writing settling.</p> <p>“And if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation, we will attempt to contact the user’s parents and if unable, will contact the authorities in the case of imminent harm.</p> <p>“These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent with our intentions,” Altman said.</p> <p>OpenAI admitted in August its systems could fall short and it would install stronger guardrails around sensitive content after the family of 16-year-old Californian Adam Raine sued the company after the teen’s death.</p> <p>The family’s lawyer said Adam killed himself after “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, and the family alleges that GPT-4o was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.</p> <p>According to US court filings, ChatGPT allegedly guided Adam on whether his method of taking his own life would work, and also offered to help write a suicide note to his parents.</p> <p>OpenAI previously said it was examining the court filing. The Guardian approached OpenAI for comment.</p> <p>Adam exchanged up to 650 messages a day with ChatGPT, the court filing claims. In a blog post after the lawsuit, OpenAI admitted that its safeguards work more reliably in short exchanges, and after many messages over a long period of time, ChatGPT may offer an answer “that goes against our safeguards”.</p> <p>The company announced on Tuesday it was also developing security features to ensure data shared with ChatGPT is private even from OpenAI employees. Altman also said adult users that wanted “flirtatious talk” with ChatGPT would be able to have it. Adult users would not be able ask for instructions on how to kill themselves, but can ask for help in writing a fictional story that depicts suicide.</p> <p>“Treat adults like adults,” Altman said of the company’s principle.</p>",

Inflation in the hospitality sector has been stuck around 4% this year, which we think is linked to pressure from April’s payroll tax and National Living Wage hikes.</p> </blockquote> <p>While services inflation slowed to 4.7% from 5%, this was mainly because of volatile air fares. The core services basket stayed at 4.2%, Smith calculated.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, we think there is still scope for services inflation to undershoot the Bank’s forecasts further in the next release for September. And more broadly, we are seeing a significant easing in rental growth, which is set to be a significant source of service sector disinflation over the coming months.</p> <p>If we’re right about that, it would tip the balance slightly more in favour of a November rate cut, which we still narrowly expect. Certainly, we aren’t in the camp that thinks rate cuts are over. Services inflation should show more visible progress next spring, while wage growth should ease below 4% by year-end. Add in the fact that the late-November autumn Budget is likely to be dominated by tax rises, and <strong>we think there’s still a decent case for UK interest rates to fall two or three more times by next summer.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68ca5f358f0862eec18cf9e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T07:14:34.223Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Price growth for services, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, has slowed to 4.7% from 5% in July, while goods inflation ticked up to 2.8% from 2.7%.</strong></p> <p><strong>Sanjay Raja</strong>, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>The good news is that August inflation data has corrected some of the upside surprise we saw last month.

And despite better services data this morning, inflation in the largest basket remains sticky. To be sure, there are some encouraging bits of information in today’s report – and we will need to see more of this for the Bank of England to cut Bank Rate again.</p> <p>This is why we continue to see a slightly longer pause when it comes to the Bank’s next rate move.

    "description": "<p>The second season of this wildly irreverent spinoff of R-rated superhero satire The Boys is packed with swearing, violence – and an astonishing number of penises</p>",
    "content": "<p>Two years after we last joined its troubled teens in their battle against the forces of corporate tyranny, superhero drama Gen V is back for a second series of powerfully bawdy chaos. Release the penis-shaped balloons! Uncork the Château les Norks! But for pity’s sake conduct your celebrations quietly: Godolkin University’s clipboard-clutching new dean is in no mood for frivolity.</p> <p>“Let’s be real,” he drawls during his inaugural campus address. “The previous human administration was full of shit. We can’t trust humankind. And that is why, as your new dean, I will be preparing you for this brave new world,” he continues, as the assembled superheroes-in-training – or “supes”, as they’re called – variously gulp, whoop and clench their bum cheeks.</p> <p>So! New God U, new you. Specifically, new Emma (the wonderful Lizze Broadway), whose relief at her sudden release from the Elmira Adult Rehabilitation Center is tempered by the discovery that her lightly tyranny-padded seat of learning has gone full fascist.</p> <p>A brief recap, then, before we get our Speedos wet. The first series of this wildly irreverent spin-off of the sublime, R-rated superhero satire The Boys ended with Emma and fellow supes Marie, Andre and Jordan being stitched up by Homelander after their discovery of the clandestine, Vought-run medical/torture facility known as the Woods. (Homelander, for those not yet au fait with The Boys, is the psychopathic superhero figurehead of dastardly corporate cabal Vought International. Think, if you can stomach it, Trump in tights.) Got it? Good. And now? Marie (Jaz Sinclair) has escaped from Elmira and is on the run. After a valiant struggle with the powers that be, Andre (Chance Perdomo), alas, was not as fortunate. (Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/30/chance-perdomo-dead-27\">Perdomo’s death in 2024</a>, the decision was made not to recast the role.)</p> <p>Back at Godolkin, Emma and fellow releasee Jordan (London Thor/Derek Luh) are greeted by a grinning wall of suits and forced to read to the press a Vought-approved “victory” speech that turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be rubbish. Jordan, understandably, is suspicious. Not least of Dean Cipher (yes, Cipher), whose densely bearded presence Jordan is convinced they spotted “more than once” at Elmira. “He was a doctor or something,” the bi-gender shapeshifter tells a characteristically open-mouthed Emma. “And now he’s the dean? I mean, who the fuck is this guy?” Who indeed. Facts, discovers Emma, are thin on the ground. “I mean, the name ‘Cipher’ is a little on the nose, honestly …”</p>    <p>Cipher is played by Hamish Linklater, which is in itself a little on the nose, honestly. Is there anyone as adept at extravagant, nay, luxuriant creepiness as Hamish “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/24/midnight-mass-review-netflix-mike-flanagan-haunting-of-hill-house\">Midnight Mass</a>” Linklater? Let us discuss. Actually, let’s not. Let’s just accept that there isn’t. And then allow ourselves a gander at the actor’s spectacularly unnerving MO, albeit from a safe distance (the International Space Station, say; or crouched behind Emma during one of the bits where she suddenly goes big and all her clothes explode off). In addition to his stocks-in-trade (not blinking, being tall, speaking slowly in a sad voice before suddenly blurting out something unconscionable very quickly indeed), this particular Linklater performance comes with a range of Gen V-appropriate accessories. These include a set of ample action-eyebrows and a proclivity for calling those few, brave young supes who disagree with his belief in supe-supremacism “race traitors”. So, y’know, yikes.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, campus unrest begins to mount. Humans are subjected to increasing harassment from the loutish, Cipher-emboldened frat-supes, while hopelessly naive activists scamper around daubing the word “Resist” over posters of Homelander’s spray-tanned fizzog.</p> <p>Elsewhere, as this second series unfurls its cape, it’s a joy and a relief to discover that it is business as usual. There are several outrageous, monocle-fogging set-pieces, including a gratuitous full-frontal male locker room scene complete with prosthetic thunder-dong. (What is it with Gen V and penises? Have 5,000 words on my desk by evensong.) There is an enormous amount of swearing and violence, much sweet-natured navigating of still-unformed teenage belief systems, several mildly confusing references to events in The Boys (the fifth and final season of which arrives next year) and many, many perfect jokes about the endless commodification of mental health and gender identity.</p> <p>But isn’t all this zippiness, this pinging between tones and genres a bit, well … throwaway? Ultimately, yes! But then, aren’t most things these days, when you think about it? Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm. It’s all part of its pinball patchwork of superhero tropes, romance, comic book baddies, thumpingly broad political satire and penises. Oh, so many penises. Enjoy!</p> <p>• Gen V is on Prime Video now.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former Bank chief economist Andy Haldane says left-behind communities need investment to stem populist tide</p>",
    "content": "<p>Defeating far-right populism will require Labour to radically overhaul its “arid” approach to raising living standards in left-behind communities, the former Bank of England chief economist has said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/andy-haldane\">Andy Haldane</a> warned that Labour’s growth plans were failing to support parts of the country where voters feel neglected and disenfranchised.</p> <p>With ministers under pressure to respond to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/14/labour-mps-keir-starmer-no-10-statement-far-right-rally-london\">summer of unrest</a>, he said the “single most important thing” Keir Starmer’s government could do was to rethink its economic approach before the autumn budget.</p> <p>He said: “We need a story of growth that isn’t aridly told from 30,000 feet, but speaks to the lived experience and to the prospects and opportunities of workers in the everyday economy.</p> <p>“A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties – and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p> <p>Calling on the government to devolve more power to regional mayors and prioritise investment in skills, training, transport and affordable housing, Haldane said it was “self evident” that a change in course was required.</p> <p>No governing party since 1983 has seen its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">polling fall so far</a> in its first year in power. Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p> <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p> <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p> <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p> <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p> <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p> <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p> <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p> <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p> <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p> <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p> <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p> <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>",

Older people were hit hardest by punishing temperatures, the study found, with 85% of the dead over the age of 65, and 41% over the age of 85.</p> <p>“The vast majority of heat deaths happen in homes and hospitals, where people with existing health conditions are pushed to their limits,” said Garyfallos Konstantinoudis, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “But heat is rarely mentioned on death certificates.”</p> <p>A handful of victims who died outside were named by local newspapers. Manuel Ariza Serrano, a 77-year-old former councillor in La Rambla, Spain, died after collapsing during a walk in August, according to the town council and former colleagues in the Córdoba region, which had highs of 45C that weekend.</p> <p>Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old father of four who ran a flooring company in northern Italy, died while laying the concrete of a school building near Bologna, where temperatures reached 38C that day. He died two days before a regional order to stop outdoor construction work in the early afternoon was set to take effect.</p> <p>“He called my mother to tell her that he’d come home to prepare lunch,” his 19-year-old son, Salah, told the Italian TV station Antena 3 after his death. “That he’d be home by noon.”</p> <p>Konstantinoudis said the public health risk from heat was still being underestimated, despite the dangers.</p> <p>“No one would expect someone to risk their life working in torrential rain or hurricane winds,” he said. “But dangerous heat is still treated too casually.”</p> <p>Europe’s cities are better prepared to deal with extreme heat than in 2003, when a devastating heatwave killed 70,000 people, but emergency services are struggling to keep pace with rising temperatures and an ageing population.</p> <p>Doctors have called for local action plans when heatwaves hit, more green space in cities – which are hotter than their rural surroundings – and air-conditioning for vulnerable groups, such as residents of retirement homes.</p> <p>Madeleine Thomson, an adaptation expert at Wellcome, a non-profit health group, who was not involved in the study, said the new data showed that “no city in Europe is immune” to deaths from extreme heat.</p> <p>“If we don’t act now, the toll will rise,” she said. “We must urgently phase out fossil fuels and implement policies that protect those most at risk from increasingly deadly heatwaves.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>A pop icon and a musical legend meet on the Mull of Kintyre in 1981 and dress up as sheep in Jim Hosking’s daft, deadpan offering</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jim Hosking is the wacky deadpan surrealist of indie cinema who has now created another bizarre stoner comedy, a two-hander and a bit lower budget than his earlier works such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/the-greasy-strangler-review-jim-hosking-feature-debut-serial-killer-naked-body-cooking-fat-murders\">The Greasy Strangler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/17/evening-beverly-luff-linn-review-aubrey-plaza-jermaine-clement-jim-hosking-comedy\">An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn</a>. It is like an epic-length Mitchell and Webb sketch in fact, the kind of film you find yourself laughing along to, just a bit, in a spirit of throwing in the towel – a spirit of not quite being able to believe that two actors, mugging and gurning at each other, really are saying these same lines to one other, over and over again.</p> <p>The setting is Mull of Kintyre in 1981, and a pop star called Paul, with a strangely familiar but also entirely ersatz Liverpool accent, is welcoming a visitor, who arrives implausibly by rowing boat through the choppy grey sea. This is a blind Black pop legend called Stevie, who appears nonetheless to be able to see (and derisively imitate) Paul’s quirkiest mannerism whenever he gives it: a perky thumbs-up. (They are played, respectively, by Hosking’s regulars Sky Elobar and Gil Gex.)</p> <p>After a cup of tea, some whisky and a “doobie-woobie”, they have conversations that might be those of two space aliens from separate planets. They seem alternately wary, hostile, and yet finally willing to tolerate and even welcome each other’s existences. This is a relationship which survives going swimming together in the icy sea (are these penile prostheses, incidentally?), dressing up as sheep and saying “Baaaaa!”, and other peculiar adventures.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgUdOCftgKQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qgUdOCftgKQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Is this encounter really going to foment the personal and creative atmosphere in which two great talents are going to create one of the most pro-racial-harmony pop singles in history? Maybe. Never at any time do they get down to the business of talking about this song, or trying out some melodies or lyrics – legal and copyright restraints would otherwise certainly become an issue. But it is funny when Stevie repeatedly and angrily shouts the words “Scottish cottage” in his American accent. Silliness of this purity is rare.</p> <p>• Ebony and Ivory is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.</p>",

And rather than impose sweeping sanctions, British ministers facilitate trade with <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/688abde61affbf4bedb7b105/israel-trade-and-investment-factsheet-2025-08-01.pdf\">Israel worth £6bn</a> a year.</p> <p>While Israeli president Isaac Herzog – whose genocidal utterances about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/16/the-language-being-used-to-describe-palestinians-is-genocidal\">collective Palestinian guilt</a> were repeated by soldiers on the ground – is awarded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/starmer-and-israeli-president-had-tough-exchanges-over-gaza\">honour of an official visit</a>, hundreds of peaceful protesters holding placards opposing genocide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">have been arrested</a> as though they are dangerous extremists.</p> <p>Every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public. After all, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">seven in 10 British people</a> think it’s likely Israel has committed war crimes, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/04/04/8aa72/1\">a majority</a> supports an arms embargo, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/52694-british-attitudes-to-the-israel-gaza-conflict-july-2025-update\">only a fifth</a> think Israel’s attack on Gaza is justified, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">and over half</a> support Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sanctioning two of the most extreme Israeli ministers – the aforementioned Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – makes no impact on the state’s genocidal war machine, and recognising a Palestinian state amounts to nothing more than a welcome symbolic gesture.</p> <p>The lives of those living in Gaza are deemed less important than maintaining relations with Israel and, by proxy, the US. At the personal level, on Labour’s doorsteps, this approach plays out in the most callous of ways. Dalloul al-Neder is a Palestinian refugee from Gaza, who was a constituent of the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. He got to know her, meeting several times: <a href=\"https://x.com/owenjonesjourno/status/1751706247311524178\">she visited his takeaway shop</a> in 2019 and posed for pictures, declaring “Palestine must be free”. She took him on a tour of parliament. </p>    <p>Within weeks of the genocide beginning, in October 2023, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two young nieces were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Desperate to evacuate his wife and four-month-old daughter – who had been buried under rubble three times by Israeli attacks – he emailed Rayner twice to seek help evacuating his family. He says received no response.</p> <p>In January 2024, he attended a Labour fundraiser in Stockport addressed by Rayner and her colleague, Jonathan Reynolds, and got to his feet, clutching pictures of his dead mother, begging her to support a ceasefire, emotionally declaring “I lost my family in Gaza”. The whole tawdry episode is on camera: he was aggressively ejected from the meeting and on to the street. Rayner did nothing, except to say “thank you, you’ve made your point”. She then unfollowed him on social media. Days later, she was <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/labours-angela-rayner-no-longer-goes-out-because-of-threats-and-was-scared-by-protest-confrontation-13062124\">interviewed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby</a>, who framed the incident as an example of the threats politicians face, linking it to the murder of the MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Since then, so many of Neder’s relatives have been slaughtered by the Israeli state that their names take up three pages of a notebook.</p> <p>Imagine if an Israeli citizen had been aggressively ejected from the fundraiser of a politician they knew well, after clutching photographs of their slaughtered family and begging for the violence to end. Rather than being framed as an example of the dangerous abuse suffered by politicians, the resulting uproar would be splashed on newspapers and lead news bulletins.</p> <p>Our government is shirking away from uncomfortable truths. It denies genocide, because admitting it would mean confessing their own complicity. The truth, as they say, will out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "<p>Take heed from European history: this could be the pretext for the repression of the US president’s political opponents</p>",
    "content": "<p>If 2025 was already shaping up to be the worst year of the century for the post-1945 rules-based world order, the past week has been its most destructive week yet. Israel deepened its disregard for international conventions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/monday-briefing-israels-bombing-of-qatar-threatens-the-fabric-of-gulf-security\">sending 10 fighter jets to Qatar</a>, bombing a Hamas delegation participating in ceasefire talks in Doha. The last meaningful forum for diplomatic negotiation may now have gone up in smoke. </p> <p>At least 19 Russian drones violated Poland’s airspace. For the first time in its history, Nato airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a Nato country. Whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/russian-drone-incursion-poland-nato-ukraine-europe\">the incursion</a> was a technical mishap or deliberate probing by Moscow, as western experts believe, this was “the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said.</p> <p>And then Charlie Kirk, a firebrand conservative activist and close Donald Trump ally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-killing\">was shot dead</a> while addressing college students and Maga supporters at a Utah university. Without evidence of the shooter’s identity or motives, Trump immediately blamed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/sep/10/trump-blames-radical-left-political-violence-for-killing-of-charlie-kirk-video\">those on the radical left</a>,” accusing them of rhetoric “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”</p> <p>Asked how the divided nation could heal after Kirk’s assassination, Trump said he “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">couldn’t care less</a>”. His explanation for that was chilling: “The radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy.” This is how polarisation hardens into tribalism. This is how the spiral of hatred accelerates toward a point of no return.</p> <p>In reality, more than three-quarters of all extremist-related killings in the US over the last 10 years have <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024\">come from rightwing extremists</a>, with the radical left responsible for only a fraction of them. Trump condemned political violence in general the following day – but did not acknowledge the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence\">recent spate of attacks</a> against Democrats, including several killings. To him, the problem is always “them”, never the “wonderful Americans” who make up his base.</p> <p>The political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk’s death will no doubt unfold in the coming weeks, but the biggest danger in a polarised climate is that the shooting becomes the Reichstag fire of our age. That arson attack on<strong> </strong>27 February 1933 marked Germany’s pivot from fragile democracy to outright dictatorship. Hitler, freshly installed as chancellor, seized the moment to extinguish the freedoms of the Weimar constitution – expression, press, association, assembly.</p> <p>“Anyone who stands in our way will be cut down,” <a href=\"https://germanhistorydocs.org/en/nazi-germany-1933-1945/rudolf-diels-head-of-the-prussian-political-police-on-the-reichstag-fire-of-february-27-1933-retrospective-account-1949\">he said</a>, inspecting the arsoned building. Thousands of communists were jailed, including all 81 Communist deputies in parliament. With the left neutralised, the Nazis swiftly consolidated power.</p> <p>In today’s US, Kirk’s death has gripped the country, galvanising the Maga movement and Trump’s supporters, and he knows it. The white supremacist Matt Forney clamoured for the arrest of every Democratic politician, openly claiming the killing as the movement’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-trump-reaction\">Reichstag fire moment</a>.</p>    <p>The reality is that here is the event that could rescue an increasingly unpopular presidency scarred by a sharp drop in employment figures, a weakening dollar, and a housing crisis. Trump mourned Kirk as though he were family, but the rhetoric suggested this would be as much about pursuing Trump’s enemies as justice. Right after the assassination, Trump promised to go after “each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity … including the organisations that fund and support it.” He singled out George Soros, the American-Hungarian philanthropist and Democrat donor. “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-radical-left-healing-charlie-kirk-assassination-rcna231032\">He’s a bad guy</a>,” Trump told NBC News, he “should be put in jail.”</p> <p>The motive behind Kirk’s killing remains unclear. The political views of the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appear as muddled as those of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20 year old who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-shooting\">attempted to assassinate</a> Trump in Pennsylvania. Is this truly the radical left attacking the radical right – or is it the strange, chaotic subculture of online niches spilling into the real world? The slogans <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/bella-ciao-to-owo-what-the-engravings-on-bullets-in-charlie-kirk-case-may-refer-to-13430554\">etched on to the bullet casings</a> in Utah read less like an ideological manifesto than a crude bricolage of puerile memes and gaming references.</p> <p>But it is hard not to fear that the repression of “unwilling” academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants, military officers, and judges in the US will intensify. Already, reactions on social media have led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\">wave of</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\">sackings</a> and US state department officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/christopher-landau-charlie-kirk-foreigners\">have warned foreign nationals</a> not to praise or make light of Kirk’s assassination, instructing consulates to take “appropriate action” against any foreigners who do. </p> <p>Trump has long thrived on chaos and disorder. Where real crises do not exist, he fabricates them – including imagined crime pandemics in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago. Fake chaos fuels his power grab. Now he has been handed chaos on a silver platter. No wonder he couldn’t care less if the nation comes together.</p> <p>The shooting provides the perfect pretext for tightening his grip, silencing dissent, and concentrating power – so that his successors may inherit full state control, regardless of charisma, merit or mandate. After all, any autocratic system has to be built first; once entrenched, it becomes far easier to maintain.</p> <p>Liberal democracy and the rules-based global order are far from perfect, but they have delivered peace, progress and prosperity – the very opposite of authoritarianism. To suggest that the US, the architect of the postwar order, could soon slide into full-blown autocracy, its leaders thinking like Nazis in 1933, may seem far-fetched.</p> <p>But from another vantage point, it is not far-fetched at all. Totalitarianism was still within living memory when many of us, even at the heart of ​modern democratic Europe, were growing up. From Belgium to Bulgaria, most families have some history of the death, destruction, hatred and destitution that authoritarianism leaves behind. If Americans want to save their near future, they may want to consult our recent past.</p> <ul> <li><p>David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

    "description": "<p>Cosying up to Trump is an all-in gamble. Britain should be building better relations with more reliable allies closer to home</p>",
    "content": "<p>Interpreters are not required for visiting US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-agenda-key-takeaways\">heads of state</a>, but that doesn’t mean Donald Trump and Keir Starmer will speak the same language this week. The UK prime minister will practise the art of tactful diplomacy emphasising mutual advantage and historical alliance. Most of the words in that sentence mean nothing to a president who is fluent only in self-interest.</p> <p>Given the likelihood of miscommunication between two men from such different political cultures – the showbiz demagogue and the lawyer technocrat – relations have been remarkably friendly and, in Downing Street’s estimation, fruitful.</p> <p>The contrast in styles has been turned to an advantage. The prime minister’s quiet solicitousness makes no competitive claim on the president’s limelight.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/17/keir-starmer-curious-relationship-trump-ukraine-talks-zelenskyy-russia\">has praised Starmer</a> as a “good man” with a “beautiful accent”. He has agreed trade terms that are marginally less vindictive than the tariff regime applied to the rest of Europe. British lobbying has been instrumental in softening White House disdain for Nato and nudging the president towards scepticism about Vladimir Putin’s motives in Ukraine.</p> <p>Managing the transatlantic relationship is one of the few things Starmer’s shrinking band of loyalists confidently cite as an achievement. Privately, some of the prime minister’s Tory opponents concede the point. But in the restive ranks of the Labour party, and a broad swath of public opinion, Trump is seen as a monster whose flimsy favours are not worth the price in national self-abasement.</p> <p>Anyone hoping the state visit may include some hint of official rebuke for the honoured guest’s authoritarian character will be disappointed. Flattery and regal pomp to secure Britain’s status as Trump’s most esteemed tributary are the whole point.</p> <p>Pre-cooked deals on nuclear and tech cooperation will be unveiled. Awkward differences on foreign policy – Britain’s imminent recognition of a Palestinian state; the US’s continued indulgence of Russian aggression – will not be aired in public.</p> <p>Not by the prime minister, at least. No amount of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/trump-uk-analysis-normal-rules-of-state-visits-do-not-apply\">Foreign Office contingency planning</a> can insure against Trump’s capacity for unscripted sabotage. Even if the personal affection for Starmer is sincere, it is an outlier emotion in a man whose power base throbs with hostility to Labour Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister can only pray that those prejudices don’t surface in some spontaneous televised riff on popular Maga themes – repression of free speech via social-media content regulation; submersion of indigenous white folk in a rising migrant tide. Even if that doesn’t happen, the hazard reveals a flaw in the policy of uncritical intimacy with an inherently unreliable regime.</p> <p>The case for Starmer’s method is that Britain’s economic and security interests are inseparable from US power and will remain so for the foreseeable future. To attempt strategic decoupling out of distaste for an incumbent president would be myopic self-indulgence. Such influence as a junior ally might have over a prickly protector needs to be exercised sparingly in private. The more openly dissenting approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/emmanuel-macron-criticises-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland\">sometimes showcased</a> by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, doesn’t get results. Besides, France is part of the EU. Brexit puts Britain in a different category in Trump’s mind and, it is said, thereby affords unique opportunities.</p> <p>A version of this argument was <a href=\"https://www.ditchley.com/sites/default/files/61st%20Annual%20Lecture%20delivered%20by%20Lord%20Mandelson%20%20-%20transcript.pdf\">set out in a speech</a> by Peter Mandelson, shortly before his dismissal as ambassador to Washington last week. The thrust was that the 21st century will be shaped by superpower rivalry between the US and China. The winner will be the one that dominates in the fields of AI, quantum computing and other such innovations with awesome dual-use military applications. Britain is disproportionately competitive in this field, given its size.</p> <p>In short, the UK is bound by common interests and post-Brexit realpolitik to join Team USA when the only alternative is a world order dictated by the Chinese Communist party. “Like it or not, our US partnership has become indispensable to the functioning of our nation,” said Mandelson.</p> <p>That perspective will continue to shape the government’s foreign policy regardless of who is the ambassador to Washington. It contains some truth about the new technological arms race but, more importantly, it goes with the deep grain of Britain’s postwar Atlanticist bias. It also brushes aside any obligation to work harder at reintegration with the rest of Europe, which is a fiddly multilateral process. It has complex moving parts and a tendency to start awkward conversations about labour migration. Starmer is making incremental progress in his reset of EU relations. Negotiations on agricultural trade, defence and energy cooperation are ongoing. But the mechanics of cosying up to the White House are simpler and the reward in political gratification comes quicker.</p> <p>Trump does deals briskly, but he undoes them just as fast. His word is not a bond. His commitments are conditional. Preferential treatment for British business might be promised, but not delivered, or partly implemented, and one day reversed. The president signed agreements in his first term that count for nothing now. His modus operandi is extortion, the classic protection racket. He inflicts pain – tariffs for foreign governments; lawsuits or bureaucratic harassment for domestic companies – and offers to relieve the suffering in exchange for some commercial advantage. Paying up encourages the bully to come back for more.</p> <p>This is the economic corollary to Trump’s political assault on judicial independence, pluralism and the rule of law. British citizens might not be directly threatened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-national-guard-democratic-run-memphis\">deployment of the national guard</a> to US cities under the guise of law enforcement or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/los-angeles-ice-raids\">paramilitary immigration force</a> that kidnaps people from the streets, but that doesn’t mean the corrosion of democracy in the US has no bearing on UK interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/us-americans-republic-midterm-elections-democrats\">Americans have 400 days to save their democracy | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For one thing, the Maga project provides a template that Nigel Farage is admiring, ready to implement something along the same lines if Reform UK ever form a government. Denying them that opportunity will be easier if arguments against authoritarian nationalism have been rehearsed in advance of the general election campaign.</p> <p>That case should be made in principle, but it applies also to pragmatic calculations of geopolitical influence. Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master. Fealty to the super-potentate across the Atlantic is an all-in gamble. There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p> <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate? What is the probability of an orderly transfer of power away from a ruling party that unites religious fundamentalists, white supremacists, wild-eyed tech-utopian oligarchs and opportunist kleptocrats who cast all opposition in shades of treason?</p> <p>These are not people who humbly surrender power at the ballot box, or even run the risk of fair elections. They are not people on whose values and judgment Britain should be betting its future prosperity or national security.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Fire agencies were targeting 372,700 hectares in 2025-26 to potentially protect 232,600 properties.</p> <p>Hazard reduction – which requires “Goldilocks” levels of heat and dryness – traditionally occurs in autumn, although the RFS now thinks in terms of windows, not seasons.</p> <p>Phil Banks, a volunteer RFS group captain on the far south coast, told Guardian Australia he hoped a recruitment drive this weekend would bolster the numbers of volunteers which dropped below 70,000 in 2024-25. He said the economic climate meant many people were unable to give up a day of work when the right conditions for hazard reduction burns presented.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Banks – a captain of an RFS brigade in the Bega Valley during black summer – said he was cautiously optimistic about the coming bushfire season. Unlike 2019-20, it has not been preceded by drought, he said.</p> <p>“We’ve got moisture and we’ve got water in creeks and dams,” he said. This did mean, however, that some places could be hard to access during fires because “you wouldn’t be able to put a truck on it because the ground is wet”.</p> <p>The RFS urged households to spend <a href=\"https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/news-and-media/get-ready\">this weekend</a> preparing for the coming season, with an emphasis on protecting properties against embers blowing up to 30km ahead of any fire front, the leading cause of property loss during bushfires.</p> <p>While 70% of residents in fire-prone areas had a plan for an emergency, fewer than half took precautions like clearing gutters and maintaining hoses, the service said.</p> <p>Nigel Sargent, brigade captain of the Nelligen RFS, said there was growing anxiety in communities as, with each passing bushfire season, they moved further from “a period where the burn scar has provided a level of protection”.</p> <p>“It’s really hard to tell how bad it will be and how the community is going to respond,” he told Guardian Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/australia-national-climate-risk-assessment-summary-five-key-takeaways-heat-related-deaths-economic-cost-climate-change\">‘Cascading, compounding’: five key takeaways from Australia’s national climate risk assessment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RFS’s advice comes as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/15/millions-of-australians-at-risk-from-rising-sea-levels-and-heat-deaths-could-soar-landmark-climate-report-warns\">landmark national climate risk assessment report</a> warned that no Australian community would escape the climate crisis if global heating continued unabated.</p> <p>David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, said NSW was already experiencing climate “whiplash” between flood and drought. There was the risk of fast-burning grass fires and intense forest fires if the rain “abruptly stops”.</p> <p>“[Grass fires] are some of the most frightening fires because of the speed at which they’re able to move – they can overrun firefighting capacity.</p> <p>“The landscapes that have been burnt [in 2019-20]– if you go into them, they’re incredibly thick. Once they dry out, there are really going to be some big fires.”</p> <p>Bowman said forests around the Blue Mountains, in particular, had recovered quickly.</p> <p>Martin Tebbutt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/14/bilpin-nsw-bushfire-season-blue-mountains-fire-trails-obstructed\">who lives in Bilpin</a>, said the growth in the town was “pretty much the same as it was in 2019”.</p> <p>Tebbutt, who has written to the minister about what he says is a lack of hazard reduction in Bilpin, called for greater investment in mechanical methods, such as slashing undergrowth and clearing vegetation.</p> <p>“It’s wonderful to have all these extra planes and helicopters,” Tebbutt said of the state budget’s allocation of $34.4m over four years for new firefighting aircraft and helicopters. “But fires don’t burn without fuel.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>Pets on jets – it’s happening. From 16 October some owners will be allowed to take their furry friends on Virgin flights between Melbourne and Queensland.</p> <p>In 2021, Australia’s air regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, changed its rules so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/pets-on-planes-australians-may-soon-be-allowed-animals-in-cabins-but-airlines-are-hesitant\">airlines no longer require its explicit permission</a> to carry animals. While other airlines still require pets to travel in the cargo hold, Virgin has led the charge, now allowing them to ride topside, in the cabin. But the national first has raised a lot of questions – from where they will sit, allergies to who picks up the poo – so let’s go through the details.</p>  <h2>Which pets will be allowed?</h2>  <p>Virgin Australia has said the pets in cabin service will be “limited to small cats and dogs”.</p> <p>The animal must go into an approved pet carrier, which must fit under the seat in front. Combined, they cannot weigh more than 8kg.</p> <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>  <p>Travellers wanting their furry friends to join them will have to part with $149 to get those paws onboard. Bookings have to be made 72 hours before takeoff, and owners need to check their pets in with a guest services agent before the flight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <h2>Can everyone take their pet?</h2>  <p>No. The airline has specified there are some guests who are not allowed to take their pet. These include anyone under 18, people travelling alone with an infant, and anyone travelling with an assistance animal.</p> <h2>Do they go through screening?</h2>  <p>Pets will have to be removed from their carrier to go through screening with their owner. There is also a dress code – harnesses and leads with a lot of metal studs? Forget it. Bark collars? Don’t bother. Pets should wear a basic collar or harness, avoiding elaborate clothing or equipment that could delay security processes, the airline has warned.</p> <h2>Where do they sit?</h2>  <p>Only certain rows of seats on certain domestic flights will be eligible for pet owners wanting to use the service.</p> <p>There is to be no sitting on laps, walking of pets down the aisles or taking them to the bathroom.</p> <h2>Is it safe?</h2>  <p>For some, no. While the RSPCA welcomed the news, it warned owners of some breeds they should be cautious before flying with them.</p> <p>“Some pets – such as brachycephalic [flat-faced] breeds like pugs or Persian cats – may be at higher risk of respiratory distress during flights,” a spokesperson for the RSPCA said.</p> <p>“Others may struggle with the noise, confinement, or unfamiliar environments. We strongly encourage guardians to consult their veterinarian to assess their pet’s health and temperament before booking a flight.”</p> <h2>What about allergens?</h2>  <p>On its <a href=\"https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/travel-info/specific-travel/pets/pets-in-cabin/\">pet page</a>, Virgin explains the main sources of allergens from cats and dogs are “from direct contact with the animals, their saliva, and their dander”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/power-bank-fire-plane-risk-lithium-ion-battery-charger-explainer\">Could my power bank start a fire on board a plane? Here are the rules and the risks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the pet will remain in the carrier and aircraft is well ventilated from top to bottom, the risk of dander spreading in the cabin is reduced, the airline says.</p> <p>“With the pet carrier being placed underneath a seat, dander will be carried out of floor-level vents and filtered out, rather than recirculated,” Virgin says.</p> <p>“Therefore, for most guests, being seated a few rows away from pets will greatly reduce the likelihood of an allergen trigger occurring during the flight.”</p> <h2>What if the pet needs the bathroom?</h2>  <p>Pets will go in their carriers and owners are encouraged to bring extra absorbent wipes and a plastic bag to clean it up once the pet is off the plane.</p> <h2>How should you prepare your pet for travel?</h2>  <p>The RSPCA said owners ready to head high in the sky with their furry friends should be prepared.</p> <p>“Guardians should ensure their pet is calm, well-socialised, and comfortable in their travel carrier,” a spokesperson said. “For many animals, the carrier itself can be a source of fear, so gradual, reward-based training is key to helping them feel safe and secure.</p> <p>“RSPCA Australia encourages all pet guardians to begin carrier training early, using positive reinforcement and allowing pets to explore at their own pace. This not only improves the travel experience for pets but also ensures safety and comfort for everyone on board.”</p> <h2>How have pets fared in cabins overseas?</h2>  <p>In many overseas jurisdictions pets have been able to be carried in cabins for a fee for some time, with everything from pigs, miniature horses and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/10/20/daniel-the-emotional-support-duck-takes-his-first-plane-ride-soars-in-popularity/\">ducks</a> spotted on flights in the past.</p> <p>The US has long allowed people to fly with emotional support animals as long as airlines allow it. Passengers have tried to bring a diverse range of creatures on board over the years as they tested the parameters of the rules.</p> <p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/31/not-gonna-fly-emotional-support-peacock-turned-away-by-airline\">a woman was prevented from bringing a peacock</a> on board a United Airlines flight, despite its owner being willing to pay an additional fare for her feathered friend.</p> <p>But the scores of requests for unusual support animals eventually led the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/02/dogs-service-animals-emotional-support-us-airlines\"> US transport department</a> to ban all animals except dogs as service or emotional support animals in December 2020. Non-service animals can be taken on board in the US, with most airlines charging a fee and having limits for small pets only.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/falcons-planes-middle-east/index.html\">Middle Eastern airlines</a> also allow falcons inside cabins and to have their own passports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "description": "<p>This deeply comforting tale of record collecting, magical creatures and a lovingly knitted cardigan rambles across England</p>",
    "content": "<p>Ursula K Le Guin had her Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction; I have my comfy cardigan theory. What Le Guin proposed is that human&nbsp;culture, novels included, didn’t begin with technologies of harm, such as flints and&nbsp;spears, but with items of collection and care, such as the wicker basket or, nowadays, the carrier bag. And so, if we&nbsp;make them that way, novels can be&nbsp;gatherings rather than battles.</p> <p>Tom Cox’s third novel fashions an escape from the dangerous outside world into something soft, comforting and unfashionable. It might once have been a Neanderthal’s armpit, but now it’s more likely to be a cosy cardigan. Or a deeply comforting story.</p> <p>This shambling but intricate yarn of&nbsp;friendship, loyalty, alienation and record collecting features a depressed nature writer called Billy Stackpole, who bears a parodic resemblance to such woodcut-on-the-cover authors as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a> and Tom Cox. His debut was called Will the Stone Circle Be Unbroken: A Journey Around Britain Through Deep Time. Billy is sitting around his hand-forged firebowl when he utters the woeful/hopeful plea: “This sounds weird but I’ve never had a big sloppy cardigan and I wish I did … Just something you can throw on, at a time like this. Maybe in a nice earthy green, a bit mossy.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Within earshot is a magical sea creature capable of passing for a dog, but also of hoovering, gardening and reading Barbara Kingsolver novels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As far as Billy knows, he’s speaking to a group of eight human beings. However, also listening in, incognito, is the novel’s cosiest and most unusual character. How you react now is probably a good indication of whether you’ll like Cox’s affable, quirk-heavy brand of literary knitwear. Because also within earshot of Billy is a long-nosed, sleek-haired magical sea creature with 24 fingers who is capable of passing for a large brown dog, but also of hoovering, gardening, reading Barbara Kingsolver novels, speaking six languages, giving wise life advice, and most excellent knitting. Meet Carl – who, because he’s nice, will secretly knit Billy a cardigan.</p> <p>Carl is one half of a charming odd couple along with Liverpudlian record dealer Eric. Eric and Carl live peripatetically, though they’ve ended up in rural Dorset; and everywhere they go, and whatever mild scrapes they get into, they meet furiously nice people. Everything Will Swallow You is the story of Eric’s life, without and then with his supernatural companion. But it’s also a materially hopeful “state of England” novel. Our social fabric may be fraying, but we’re still warm and woolly, most of the time.</p> <p>Eric’s vocation is nicely chosen. Over the years, his personal fortunes follow those of the long-playing record, and we see it become an index for values of decency and kindness. When vinyl is prized, not just priced, things look up in society. The cynical mid-1990s were a low point, but with gen Z’s fond infatuation with analogue, things have been getting better.</p> <p>One way of reading Cox’s work, from his Stackpolish nature writing in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/27/21st-century-yokel-tom-cox-review\">21st Century Yokel</a> to his recent novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/01/villager-by-tom-cox-review-a-psychedelic-tangle-of-narratives\">Villager</a> and 1983, is as a counter to cartoonish Brexitshire views of the countryside. Look beyond the M25, and there’s folklore, nature, history, yes, but most important of all&nbsp;there are nice people; even if increasingly they spend most of their time looking at phone screens and getting angry with one another. His&nbsp;country, he insists, can still be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving and lovable place.</p> <p>Like vinyl records, England may go&nbsp;through periods of neglect, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nation, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/20/robin-hood-morris-dances-and-ufos-english-folklore-survey-gets-post-brexit-reboot\">folk-nature-history-haunted land</a>, there’s still something warm and ultimately dependable about us. As Eric writes in his notebook, and his words equally apply&nbsp;to comfy-cardigan fiction such as&nbsp;Everything Will Swallow You: “Records never did a lot of what I&nbsp;thought they’d do for me. They didn’t make me cooler or more handsome or&nbsp;help me solve the secret of the universe. But they helped get me through some hard times and taught&nbsp;me that magic is real.”</p> <p>• Everything Will Swallow You by Tom Cox is published by Swift (£16.99).

After five hours of everything from body rolls to voguing with pompoms and a classic cheerleading lift, the excited group gathered round Janecke to <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdgDrgWT/\">make a TikTok</a> of one of the latest South African amapiano dance challenges. They were done in just two takes.</p> \n<p>Janecke has been at the forefront of the growing global popularity of South African dance and music in the past few years. Having worked with Tyla since she was 17, he was responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SgLnflHyQ24\">viral dance</a> that accompanied Water, the breakout hit that propelled the now 23-year-old South African singer and songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/25/its-sunny-with-music-bumping-and-everyone-in-ripped-clothing-how-tyla-set-a-new-pop-mood\">to worldwide fame</a>.</p> \n<p>Janecke now wants to turn his own growing reputation into a global brand, moving beyond the South African music industry while still retaining the essence of his culture.</p> \n<p>“When I speak about my life it makes me emotional to know this is where it’s come to, and that where it’s come to feels like a new start,” he said, after finishing the day’s rehearsal.</p> \n<p>Janecke grew up in Bonteheuwel in Cape Town and then Eldorado Park in Johannesburg, both historically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/10/tyla-racial-identity-south-africans-coloured\">“Coloured”</a> townships. He heard his grandpa playing Madonna and Michael Jackson, and would dance at family events. He initially planned to study accounting after school, but was unable to resist the pull of dance, in which he has never been formally trained.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"91161169-9296-431f-84a4-385d647d3cde\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rCUPVXdVTXA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By 2011, Janecke was exploring femininity in dance and accepted himself as gay. He co-founded V.I.N.T.A.G.E, South Africa’s first male dance crew focused on vogueing and whacking, styles that originated in New York’s ballroom scene in the late 1980s and 1990s.</p> \n<p>The crew, which expanded to include women and a fashion stylist, participated in numerous televised dance competitions. However, it came second in all but the last one it entered, something Janecke blamed on South Africa not yet being ready for the openly LGBTQ+ dancers.</p> \n<p>In 2013, the group was attacked at a minibus taxi rank as they travelled back from performing at Soweto Pride. A mob surrounded their taxi, yelling and rocking the vehicle from side to side, until the conductor finally persuaded them to disperse. “It gave: ‘Yeah girl, this is the end for you,’” recalled Janecke.</p> \n<p>By 2015, V.I.N.T.A.G.E had disbanded, as Janecke started getting booked alone, choreographing the talent show Idols South Africa for six years. He was hired by Tyla’s first manager to train her. “I [felt]: ‘There’s something about this girl.’ I can see it in their eyes,” he said.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward to 2025 and the rehearsal with the cheerleaders – two university squads opening a Red Bull half-court basketball tournament with numbers choreographed by Janecke – was just a few days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/08/vmas-2025-winners-lady-gaga-ariana-grande-sabrina-carpenter-award-ceremony-mtv\">MTV Video Music Awards</a>. Tyla took home Best Afrobeats for Push2Start. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLK2r3sG4lE&amp;list=RDuLK2r3sG4lE&amp;start_radio=1\">video</a> was choreographed <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdgy88qR/\">by Janecke</a>, who was also nominated for best choreography.</p> \n<p>This was the pinnacle of more than two years of working with Tyla internationally on everything from <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/UGFN881mPT4?si=tpN0vj3ypTHd2tTJ\">The Voice finale</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C87O4PZJLoV/?igsh=MWFkZWQwc2owaTZuMQ==\">BET Awards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7503984169244953911\">Coachella</a>. Janecke also choreographed US and UK shows <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKXAjRVCkEs/?igsh=OWNwdndramhjOXhm\">for the DJ Uncle Waffles</a> and taught <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK9-CEFI5iB/?igsh=MWw4ZDdpcmVzdmxhMQ==\">amapiano classes at Ailey Extension</a>, the studio of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater company in New York, and at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7494570271681039622\">Playground in LA</a>.</p> \n<p>“For me, the end of that chapter is the VMA nomination,” Janecke said. He was <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7540234973949857032\">on set</a> when he found out he had been nominated: “I immediately burst into tears.

I always knew that this is where my destiny lies.”</p> \n<p>Janecke gesticulated as he spoke, getting up to demonstrate dance moves. “I have to take the right steps to continue expressing and getting this brand out there, away from the names attached to it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80383946-1da3-4402-b95f-e73e5b4c4d92\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDqyaRAHyqA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He listed his ambitions – getting a US agent, working with everyone from Dua Lipa and Doechii to Beyoncé and Madonna, and breaking into the K-pop market, advertising and musicals.

    "description": "<p>I should have been devastated when I came third in a public speaking competition. But the joy that came out of nowhere has shaped the rest of my life</p>",
    "content": "<p>“I am a teenager, living in an age with war, corruption, discrimination, racism, sexism. But no one seems angry about it. People see the slight advances towards equal society as having solved our issues entirely and it just isn’t enough.”</p> <p>It’s March 2015, and I’ve done it: I’ve solved inequality. Standing in the basement room of Modern Art Oxford for my regional heat of the Articulation prize public speaking competition, I truly believe that I may have just introduced this room full of parents and teachers to the concept of feminism. I’m very pleased with myself.</p> <p>The Articulation prize is a competition for post-GCSE students, aged 16 to 19, who are given 10 minutes to present on a work of art of their choice. I was told about it by my head of sixth form, whose office I had ended up in just weeks before the competition. As a pupil, I was clever but chatty and easily distracted. I felt everything acutely and was frequently overwhelmed and tearful.</p> <p>I also took an all-or-nothing approach to my education: either be the best, or don’t bother. In the office, we discussed my decision to drop history AS-level within weeks of starting because I didn’t think it would be possible for me to finish it with an A. “Not everything is death or glory, Verity,” he implored.</p> <p>Along with my longsuffering art teacher, the head of sixth form recognised that Articulation was exactly the opportunity that I needed – after all, I loved art AS-level, and was suitably gobby as part of the school’s rag-tag debate club. He suggested I prepare something for a preliminary in-school heat. From memory, I don’t think anyone else applied.</p>    <p>I chose to speak about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/damien-hirst-tate-review\">Damien Hirst’s medicine cabinets</a>, which I had seen at his 2012 retrospective at Tate Modern (the poster of which is still stuck on the wall behind my desk). I’d seen Hirst’s work for the first time as a child visiting Ilfracombe, the north Devon town where my grandmother had grown up, and where Hirst had a restaurant, the Quay, full of formaldehyde-imprisoned fish, and wallpaper covered in pills. I loved that his work was funny and contrarian, and that he got away with calling whatever he wanted “art”. I loved that my grandmother hated it. But maybe most of all, I loved that, because the medicine cabinet installations were named after tracks on their 1977 album, I was going to say “Sex” (Pistols) several times during the talk. I truly was the most radical young thinker of my generation.</p> <p>At the regional heat, there were nine other speakers, all of whom had better historical references, made fewer unqualified, sweeping statements, and used the word “bollocks” less. I was awarded third place. As a teenager who put almost all of her self-worth on achievement, this would usually have been a devastating outcome. But, in that moment, the fact that people seemed to enjoy my talk, and had laughed exactly when I had wanted them to, felt enough.</p> <p>By the time Articulation invited me to give my talk again, this time as part of a conference at the British Museum, I had sent in my application to read history of art at Oxford. Before the competition, I had thought I was going to apply for English or German, but certainly not at Oxbridge, where I knew I would never be “the best”. But the competition had emboldened me and made me believe that my opinions were worth sharing, even when I didn’t speak the lingo. I didn’t need to be the best: I just needed to put my spin on things.</p> <p>Talking about art – and finding ways to make people laugh while I do it – quickly became my north star. My Articulation journey came full circle when I was invited back this spring to be the first graduate judge of an Articulation heat.</p> <p>The competition gave me confidence beyond my degree choice: not that I could achieve great things, but that I didn’t have to. I no longer needed to covet perfection; I needed to lean into my own voice. I went from being anxious and easily overcome – passionate but quick to frustration – to someone who believed in their capabilities. I didn’t need to be perfect. For the first time, authenticity meant more to me than flawlessness. </p> <p>I’ll always be grateful to the sixth-form head who made the effort to understand me when I was an obstinate and emotional teenager, rather than simply rolling his eyes (and, looking back, I think an eye roll would have been entirely justified). Not everything <em>was</em> death or glory; I learned that it is often worth trying, even without the promise of “winning”.</p> <p><em>• </em>The History of Art in One Sentence by Verity Babbs is published by Bloomsbury, £14.99.

    "description": "<p>Authorities say they no longer have legal justification to hold Christian Brückner in jail after serving rape sentence</p>",
    "content": "<p>The main suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann was freed on Wednesday as German authorities admit they no longer have legal justification to hold him in jail.</p> <p>Christian Brückner, 49, was released from prison in Sehnde, northern Germany, after serving a sentence for the rape of an American woman, then 72 years old, in Portugal in 2005, a reporter for the AFP news agency at the scene reported. </p> <p>The rape took place in Praia da Luz, the holiday resort on the southern Portuguese coast where the three-year-old British toddler disappeared 18 months later.</p> <p>German prosecutors say that Brückner, a German national, remains their prime suspect in the disappearance, which they are treating as a murder inquiry. British police call him a suspect in their investigation, which they continue to treat as a missing-persons case.</p> <p>Madeleine went missing on 3 May 2007 while on holiday with her parents. She vanished from the ground-floor apartment where the family was staying, while her parents were at a restaurant close by. Her young twin siblings had been in the room with her.</p> <p>Hans Christian Wolters, a lead investigator in the case, reiterated in a recent interview his belief that Brückner was responsible for the girl’s disappearance. “We believe that he is responsible for the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and that he killed Madeleine McCann,” he said in a recent statement.</p> <p>Prosecutors have urged authorities to ensure Brückner is fitted with an electronic ankle tag so that his movements can be tracked, but it is unclear whether the court will agree to this. They have also requested that Brückner relinquish his passport and report regularly to authorities, citing fears that he might try to leave the country.</p> <p>German police have been investigating Brückner since 2017. State prosecutors have said they have circumstantial evidence indicating his possible involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance. These include that his mobile phone was on and logged in in the area where she vanished, and the sworn testimony of three witnesses who say he confessed to them.</p> <p>After being alerted about Brückner following a TV crime programme in Germany that called for information a decade after the child’s disappearance, the federal criminal police office named him as a suspect in 2020. They revealed he had convictions going back decades for child sex offences and other crimes, including drug trafficking, burglary and petty theft.</p> <p>Brückner had lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007, and had worked at the Praia da Luz resort as a pool maintenance assistant.</p> <p>Last autumn, Brückner was cleared by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/main-suspect-in-mccann-disappearance-acquitted-in-separate-and-abuse-trial\">court </a>in the northern German city of Braunschweig of several unrelated sexual offences, alleged to have occurred between 2000 and 2017. He has consistently denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p> <p>Ahead of Brückner’s release, his lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, said in a statement that no comment would be made to the media outside the prison either by him or Brückner.</p> <p>Brückner has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/prime-madeleine-mccann-suspect-refuses-met-interview-before-german-prison-release\">refused a request</a> by British authorities, made through an “international letter of request”, for an interview on his release.</p> <p>DCI Mark Cranwell, a senior investigating officer for London’s Metropolitan police, said the request had been “refused by the suspect”. He added that the Met would “nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry”.</p> <p>After completing his seven-anda-half-year sentence for the 2005 rape, Brückner had been expected to stay behind bars until January 2026 because of his owing €1,447 (£1,253) in fines for a separate offence. However, a former police officer who had worked on the investigation into Brückner paid the fine because, she has said, she “felt sorry” for him. She has since said she made a mistake.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The people of Dysart in central Queensland are used to seeing workers come and go.</p> <p>When news broke that the nearby Saraji South coalmine would be mothballed by November, however, they began preparing to farewell many more.</p> <p>“The closure of a mine is always a concern around here,” baker Toby Teelow says. “Because the town only survives when the mines are open. There’s nothing else in the town. There’s no other sustainable business without the influx of mining.”</p> <p>BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) announced the decision to place the Saraji South coalmine into care and maintenance and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/bhp-queensland-deputy-premier-labels-unaustralian-as-mining-giant-blames-job-cuts-on-coal-royalties-scheme\">slash 750 roles across the state on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>According to the Mining and Energy Union (MEU), most of the BMA jobs cuts will be corporate and support roles, with only 72 of them being coal production jobs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>And other mines in the larger Saraji metallurgical coalmine complex will continue operating.</p> <p>But losing six dozen mining jobs can rock a place like Dysart, which was founded in 1973 to service the burgeoning coal industry. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of about 2,900 people – with a workforce in which more than 41% of worked coalmining. The next biggest sector was labour supply, which amounted to less than 6% of Dysart’s workforce. People living in Dysart were younger, more likely to be male and earn a bit less than double the weekly wage of the average Queenslander.</p> <p>“Here, everyone wears an orange shirt,” Teelow says.</p> <p>Teelow put down the blades of his old profession as a butcher in the southern Queensland city of Toowoomba to pick up the rolling pin more than 800km north after his wife took a job teaching in Dysart about three years ago.</p> <p>It was around that time Saraji South was ramping back up production after having been mothballed for eight years from 2012.</p> <p>“That definitely brought people to the town,” Teelow says. “And more people in town means more business … so, yeah, it [closing] is a bit of a shock. But people around here just keep going on with life”.</p> <p>Another small business owner to move to town in recent years is Hitesh Patel.</p> <p>Patel and his wife run a cafe and pizza shop that employs a friend and five high school students.</p> <p>“Business … it’s OK, but I can’t tell you it’s steady,” Patel says. “Up and down, up and down.”</p> <p>A chef who moved up from Melbourne, Patel says he was already preparing for work to become more sporadic as summer loomed and more mine workers opted to fly in and out.</p> <p>“And this will make it more difficult for us,” he says of the Saraji South mothballing.</p> <p>But as small businesses prepare for a slow down, one shop is bracing for a surge in work: Vinnies. A volunteer at the op shop, who did not want to be named, says every week already brings an influx of unwanted goods – and much of it brand new.</p> <p>“Mondays are exhausting every week,” she says. “It’s overwhelming. Look, this town, they come and go”.</p> <p>The volunteer says the mine closure has been the talk of Dysart for months.</p> <p>“Now that it is out in the open, we don’t know when the influx of more unwanted goods and donations will be coming in,” she says.</p> <p>“Next week? We don’t know.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "description": "<p>Plus: national teams with top-10 scorers in the 21st century, different kits in the same match (2) and a referee’s coin toss</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\"><strong>Mail us</strong></a><strong> with your questions and answers</strong></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p><strong>“Who is the most prolific player with the initials XG?”</strong> asks Oliver Forrest. <strong>“And who has the highest goals and assists of players with the initials GA?”</strong></p> <p>There are only a handful of male* footballers with the initials XG – here is an exhaustive list. The diminutive journeyman Greek midfielder <strong>Xenofon Gittas</strong> scored 17 goals across his club career (plus three for Greece Under-21s) but cannot match the scoring exploits of <strong>Xhevdet Gela</strong>, who is our winner with 44 goals across all competitions including the Europa League with the Finnish sides MyPa and Lahti. Unusually, during a spell between 2019-2022 in which Gela was playing for Ekenäs in Finland, he was also the full-time manager of a fourth-tier side, Esbo, a club around 80km away. Gela returned to the manager’s role at Esbo in January this year, although not in a playing capacity.</p> <p>Details on the former Andorra international defender <strong>Xavier Gil</strong> are sparse, but he never left the Andorran Primera Divisió and it’s fairly safe to assume that he, the Spanish centre-back Xabi Garalde (who made one appearance in Segunda B for Eibar) and the El Salvador international defender <strong>Xavier García</strong> (who did score once for El Salvador against the Cayman Islands in a 2014 World Cup qualifier) did not beat Gela’s total. The China international <strong>Geng Xiaofeng</strong> is possibly the best known footballer on this XG list, but as a goalkeeper did not trouble the scorers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/15/amazon-prime-video-prime-vision-data-champions-league-football\">Amazon to offer Champions League viewers new immersive in-game data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are thousands of footballers worldwide with the initials GA, but if we apply a bit of quality control – counting just players throughout history that have appeared at World Cups – there are two names that stand out. First, the German forward <strong>Gerald Asamoah</strong>, who has 183 goals and assists (113 goals, 70 assists) over a 19-year career, although it should be stated that many of his latter seasons were spent in the lower leagues and the reserve team of Schalke. Our winner, though, is surely <strong>Georgi Asparuhov</strong>. Nicknamed the Artist, Asparuhov scored 150 goals in 247 league games; he was also prolific in continental competition for Levski Sofia, including goals against Eusébio’s Benfica and Nereo Rocco’s Milan, and netted Bulgaria’s first ever World Cup goal in Chile in 1962, aged 19. We do not know how many assists Asparuhov registered, but he scored 188 goals across his career, which was tragically cut short at the age of 28 when he died in a 1971 car crash.</p> <p>Perhaps Asparuhov’s most famous goal was against England at Wembley in December 1968. The striker’s solo run started in his own half, continued with him outrunning the entire England defence and culminated in a neat finish into the bottom left corner. Sir Bobby Charlton later reflected: “Players as gifted as him are not born every day. He was an incredible striker,” and in 1999 Asparuhov was voted Bulgaria’s best ever footballer ahead of Hristo Stoichkov, Bulgaria’s sole Ballon d’Or winner. We can only imagine how many the Artist would have gone on to score. You can read more about Asparuhov <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/06/georgi-asparuhov-bulgaria-tragic-death\">right here</a>.</p> <p>In the Premier League, the highest goals and assists of players with the initials GA is comfortably <strong>Gabby Agbonlahor</strong> with 108 contributions (74 goals, 34 assists).</p> <p><em>* It’s much harder to find historical data for women’s football – but if you have any examples of XG goalscorers, drop us a line</em></p>    <h2><strong>Hungary for goals</strong></h2> <p><strong>“The top 10 goal</strong><strong>scorers for </strong><strong>Hungary</strong><strong> all ended their careers in the 20th century,”</strong> noted Cameron McGlone. <strong>“Which other national teams don’t have a top-10 scorer who has played in the 21st century?”</strong></p> <p>Peter Tomlin has come in clutch with this one, with the short answer to the question being … none. “I’ve looked through every single national team and their player records and I have concluded that there are no other national teams without a top-10 scorer who has played in the 21st century. There are three countries with eight of their top 10 : <strong>Indonesia</strong>, <strong>Malaysia</strong> and <strong>Poland</strong>.</p> <p>“For Indonesia, their third-highest goalscorer – <strong>Bambang Pamungkas</strong>, who scored 38 goals in 86 caps and retired in 2019 – and their fifth-highest scorer <strong>Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto</strong> (33 goals) played in the 21st century. Malaysia’s joint-sixth highest scorer <strong>Safee Sali</strong> scored 23 goals in 76 caps before retiring in 2022 and their eighth-highest, <strong>Safawi Rasid</strong>, is still playing. He has 22 goals in 70 caps.</p> <p>“Poland’s all-time top goalscorer is <strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> who has 86 goals in 160 appearances, with his latest coming in the World Cup qualifier versus Finland this month. The only other 21st-century footballer in the Polish top 10 is <strong>Jakub Blaszczykowski</strong> who is joint-ninth, with 21 goals in 109 games. He retired in 2023.</p> <p>“It could be argued that the national side of Niue have no goalscorers in the 21st century. They have no goalscorers at all as they have only ever played two matches and lost them 0-14 to Tahiti and 0-19 to Papua New Guinea!”</p> <h2><strong>Different kits in the same match (part two)</strong></h2> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/which-teams-have-worn-parts-of-three-different-kits-in-the-same-match\">last week’s leading question</a> on which teams have worn parts of three different kits in the same match, a few more of you have been in touch.</p> <p>“In the infamous <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\">Man</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\">chester United</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\"> ‘grey shirts’ match against Southampton</a>, they didn’t actually wear the full grey kit,” writes Mike Morris. “Instead it was the grey shirt, white shorts from the home kit, and white socks from … well, no kit at all actually. United changed to the third kit in the second half, meaning they wore bits of four separate outfits.”</p>    <p>“When <strong>Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic</strong> beat Accrington Stanley 2-0 in a FA Cup third-round tie at Dean Court on 5 January 1957 they hadn’t realised that in those days when there was a clash of colours it was the home team that had to change their kit. Seemingly Boscombe didn’t have a second strip so someone was urgently despatched to Portsmouth to borrow a set of blue shirts from Pompey, complete with their iconic badge, and that’s what they wore for the game. It must have been a good omen because they embarked on their best ever FA Cup run, beating Wolves and Spurs, before finally falling to Manchester United in the sixth round (by which time they had purchased a set of white shirts).”</p> <p>“Chelsea had a rule from 1964-65 that away teams could not wear the same socks, ie white, as them,” notes Martin Moran. “<strong>Spurs</strong> played at Stamford Bridge many times in all white with yellow socks. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=z5rLjAwzECnrY_b6&amp;v=C7Y5SHSFdJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Here’s a video from 1971</a>. Tottenham’s away kit was all yellow and they only two kits back then.”</p> <p>“Not quite the same thing, but in 2013 when <strong>Barnsley</strong> played Palace at Selhurst Park the referee decided that none of Barnsley’s kit was suitable because of the colours so they had to buy Palace’s yellow away kit at the club shop,” emails Barnsley fan Lee Booids. “I think that Palace charged them for the kit and Barnsley kept their red socks. I remember the Palace fans singing: ‘Are you Palace in disguise?’”</p> <p>“Whilst not an answer to this question, it did remind me of a match I attended where the home side was forced to wear their away kit at home in 1993,” adds Roger Kirby. “<strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong> wore a strip that was specifically commissioned for the Premier League match by sponsors (as it was still a novelty to be on the telly). This strip had very dark blue stripes and Wednesday didn’t take a change kit with them. As a result, Newcastle were required to wear their blue change kit to avoid a clash of striped jerseys. I think the away team should have played skins.”</p> <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>“The 1957 Floodlight Cup final in Germany between Frankfurt and Schalke was decided on the number of corners won (8-6 to Frankfurt) after the tie finished level on aggregate,”</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/which-teams-have-played-in-front-of-fake-fans-or-pumped-in-atmosphere\">wrote Andrew Burrows back in 2020</a>. <strong>“Any other unusual ways of deciding matches or tournaments?”</strong></p> <p>Paul Nash winds the clock back to early in the 1992-93 season and the curiosity that was the Anglo-Italian Cup. “<strong>Bristol Rovers</strong> lost to <strong>West Ham</strong> on a referee’s coin toss!” yelps Paul. “They had finished the English group stage on the same points and same goal difference. Rovers were a heads away from a European tournament with some relatively big names – Reggiana and Bari (who had David Platt playing for them the season before) – and it was made even worse that neighbours Bristol City qualified. Everyone I’ve told in the intervening 30 years doesn’t seem to grasp the magnitude of it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/from-shearer-to-pogba-how-10-british-record-signings-fared-in-the-premier-league\">From Shearer to Pogba: how 10 British record signings fared in the Premier League</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Can you help?</strong></h2> <p>“On 13 September 2025 Andrew Tod scored a hat-trick for Dunfermline v Arbroath,” notes Ian Golightly. “His father, Andy Tod, scored a hat-trick for Dunfermline v Dundee on 1 January 2005. Are there any other examples of a father and son who have both scored a hat-trick for the same club?”</p> <p>“On Saturday there were eight league fixtures in London (Arsenal, Palace, Fulham, West Ham, Brentford, Charlton, Wimbledon, Orient),” writes James Bolle. “This is 19 per cent of the 42 English fixtures taking place that day. Has there ever been a higher proportion of professional fixtures played in one city? And with Spurs, Chelsea and Millwall being the away teams in three of these fixtures, only two out of 13 London teams playing are leaving the capital (QPR and Barnet). Has there ever been a more London-centric day of football for London league teams?”</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/optajoe.com/post/3lysla3bww22o\">I just read</a> that Liverpool are the first side in Premier League history to win four consecutive games thanks to winning goals scored in the final 10 minutes or later,” emails Boris Cule. “I was wondering if anyone won five (or more) games in a row with such late goals in the pre-Premier League era, in the lower divisions, or elsewhere around the world.”</p> <p>“Both Sheffield teams are rooted to the bottom of the Championship,” writes Joe Scott. “Should this continue, it would be the first time both Sheffield sides have been relegated in the same season.

    "content": "<p>Sally Rooney, Deborah Levy, Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux and Pulitzer winner Viet Thanh Nguyen are among 20 authors urging French president Emmanuel Macron to resume a “lifeline” programme for evacuating Palestinian writers, scholars and artists from Gaza.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.programmepause.fr/en/\">Pause</a> programme for writers and artists in emergency situations, as well as a student evacuation programme, were abruptly suspended by the French government at the beginning of August over a Palestinian student’s allegedly antisemitic online remarks, a decision that the letter-writing authors said amounted to a “collective punishment”.</p> <p>“As writers, we urge you to restore this lifeline as soon as possible, and to call on other heads of state to create similar programmes”, says the letter, which was sent to Macron’s office on Friday.</p> <p>Further signatories include Nobel laureates Abdulrazak Gurnah and JMG Le Clézio along with Anne Enright, Leïla Slimani, Madeleine Thien, Édouard Louis, Isabella Hammad, Didier Eribon, Naomi Klein, Max Porter, Alain Damasio, Mathias Énard, Kapka Kassabova, Karim Kattan and Rashid Khalidi.</p> <p>The Pause programme was set up by the French government and the Collège de France in 2017 to help foreign researchers, scientists, intellectuals and artists who find themselves in emergency situations. It has since been used to offer French talent visas and give practical support for people from Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries.</p> <p>Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, a total of 31 Palestinian artists, writers and academics and their families have been sheltered in France through Pause and France’s student evacuation programme.</p> <p>However, on 1 August, foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot announced that “no evacuation of any kind” would continue while authorities were investigating allegedly antisemitic statements shared by a female student who had arrived in France from Gaza in July and was due to start attending classes at Sciences Po Lille University in the autumn.</p> <p>“This suspension of evacuation programmes on the basis of one case of a racist social media post is a form of collective punishment at a time when all signatories to the Genocide Conventions should be doing their utmost to save Palestinians from annihilation and should refuse to be complicit in crimes against humanity”, the appeal to the president says.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/17/scotland-isle-of-mull-restaurants-food-scene",
    "description": "<p>Field-to-fork farmers on the Scottish island are restoring abandoned crofts and serving home-grown produce and freshly caught seafood in their homesteads</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Edible means it won’t kill you – it doesn’t mean it tastes good. This, however, does taste good,” says chef Carla Lamont as she snips off a piece of orpine, a native sedum, in her herb garden. It’s crisp and juicy like a granny smith but tastes more like cucumber. “It’s said to ward off strange people and lightning strikes; but I like strange people.”</p> <p>We’re on a three-hectare (seven-acre) coastal croft on the Hebridean island of Mull. Armed with scissors, Carla is giving me a kitchen garden tour and culinary masterclass – she was a quarter-finalist in Masterchef: The Professionals a few years back. Sweet cicely can be swapped for star anise, she tells me. Lemon verbena she uses in scallop ceviche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-44-zip/giv-32554r2IKoknj43f1/\" data-alt=\"Mull map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-44-zip/giv-32554r2IKoknj43f1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>She points out a barberry bush whose small, sour berries, a Middle Eastern staple, she adds to jewelled rice, and a myrtle bush which, I learn, is different from the bog myrtle growing wild on the croft that, when the leaves are crushed, smells gloriously aromatic with hints of eucalyptus. Bog myrtle also protects your woollens from moths, wards off midges – and is a key ingredient in one of her cocktails.</p> <p>“I had never grown anything before I came here. I was in a kitchen in the city and herbs came dried in a tub. Now, if I haven’t heard of something, I give it a go or thrust it at Jonny and say ‘Greenhouse.’”</p> <p>Carla and Jonny, her husband, are part of a new wave of crofter chefs or field-to-fork farmers spreading across Scotland. Crofting is, essentially, small-scale subsistence farming, the crofter traditionally rearing a few animals and growing vegetables on the smallholding, and maintaining a job or two on the side.</p> <p>Now, just as the architect-designed, off-grid bothy is a world away from the bare-bones huts that once gave shepherds shelter, the croft has been reinvented. Our back-to-the-land yearnings, fuelled by programmes such as This Farming Life and Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild, have turned crofting into a modern rural fantasy.</p>    <p>The new generation of crofters still juggle jobs, but today, that usually involves tourism rather than working for the local laird. For Jonny and Carla, it’s a restaurant called <a href=\"https://ninthwaverestaurant.co.uk/\">Ninth Wave</a> and a cute cabin, the <a href=\"https://www.isleofmullcottages.com/cottage/the-sea-shanty.html\">Sea Shanty</a> (sleeps two from £800 a week).</p> <p>They met 30 years ago when Carla, from Canada, answered an ad for a chef on the neighbouring island of Iona. Jonny’s nickname, Carla smiles, is “the lobster man”. Every day, he hikes two miles cross-country to his small boat, the Sonsie, returning with the catch that Carla cooks in the restaurant. They also cure, smoke and brine seafood and meat on Bruach Mhor croft. When Jonny’s not fishing, he’s working the land.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s not fine dining. It’s street food presented nicely</p> <footer> <cite>Carla Lamont</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They grow about 80% of the fruit and vegetables for the restaurant in their kitchen garden, everything from cardoons to wasabi, and forage for wild herbs on the croft. They’ve counted more than 150 seasonal greens, herbs and edible flowers growing wild here. Bumping up the dirt track for lunch, the hedgerow is billowing with fluffy meadowsweet. “I’ll be harvesting it later for panna cotta,” Carla tells me.</p> <p>“People don’t realise you can eat so many flowers.” The pots of blowsy blooms by the door, it turns out, are also on the menu. “Marigolds are edible and so are dahlias. You can eat the flowers and the tubers. The Mexicans used them as their main starch crop hundreds of years ago. They’re wonderful roasted; like a cross between a potato and a jerusalem artichoke.”</p>    <p>The restaurant was once the barn or bothy, with a dirt floor and tin roof, attached to their one-bedroom cottage. And while the produce for the menu might mainly be locally grown, reared or caught, the inspiration for Carla’s dishes comes from her travels. At the end of each season, the couple head off on food adventures, grazing their way through Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.</p> <p>For lunch I’m tucking into a Mexican-inspired dish: Jonny’s lobster teetering on garden-grown roasted corn salsa, a creamy Yucatan avocado and hoja santo soup, laced with lemon verbena and Vietnamese coriander. “It’s not fine dining,” she shrugs, “it’s street food presented nicely.”</p> <p>At the other end of the island, another restaurant on a croft is also making waves as much for its architectural wow factor as its pasture-to-plate menus. Jeanette Cutlack moved to Mull from Brighton in 2008 and ran a pop-up restaurant for 10 years in her home. Her dream, however, was to restore the abandoned croft and ruined barn down the lane.</p>    <p>With the help of an old university friend, Edward Farleigh-Dastmalchi, who founded London-based architects Fardaa, she began work. <a href=\"https://croft3mull.com/\">Croft 3 </a>is now a destination restaurant, the old steading converted into a pared-back, cathedral-style dining space, open to the rafters with bare plaster walls and vast windows framing sea views; the project won a prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland award. Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir. Starters such as crab arancini and lemon mayonnaise are served alongside spicy haggis, cornbread and salsa verde. Haggis is Jeanette’s speciality and she also runs haggis-making workshops. </p> <p>Now that the land has been cleared, the 20-hectare croft is starting to bear fruit. Jeanette has planted a nectarine tree and kiwi vine. In a polytunnel, she and her family grow salad and herbs while a small flock of Hebridean sheep grazes the hill that is part of the land. Last September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/26/hogget-mutton-good-for-you\">hogget</a> was on the menu for the first time. What they don’t grow or rear themselves, they source from neighbouring crofts and fishers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mull once lagged behind the Hebrides’ culinary powerhouse, Skye, but it’s starting to emerge from its shadow. A <a href=\"https://www.mullandionafood.co.uk/\">food and drink trail</a> around the island highlights a growing number of artisan producers as well as gourmet pit stops such as pop-up turned permanent fixture <a href=\"https://www.mullandionafood.co.uk/listing/ar-bord/\">Ar Bòrd</a> (our table). Iain and Joyce Hetherington have converted their front room into a restaurant showcasing the local produce – from creel-caught shellfish landed at Croig on the island’s north coast, to organic vegetables grown by Carol Guidicelli on her croft at Langamull, near Croig, along with their in-house smoked venison. On the tiny community-owned island of Ulva, meanwhile, a short boat ride away, the <a href=\"https://www.theboathouseulva.com/\">Boathouse</a>, recently revamped by Banjo Beale, winner of a TV interior design show, has become one of the hottest lunch spots, with diners crammed around picnic tables devouring plates of briny langoustine and crab claws on the water’s edge.</p>    <p>And then there is the well established but ever-evolving award-winning <a href=\"https://isleofmullcheese.co.uk/\">Sgriob-ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheese</a>, just a few minutes’ drive from Tobermory’s pastel-painted waterfront. The Reade family arrived on the island with five cows in the 1980s and rebuilt a rundown dairy operation, starting cheese production a few years later.

After hearing a potted family history, we move on to the milking parlour where he weaves in science and Willy Wonka-style invention. The milk, he explains, is pumped to the cheese-making shed next door via an underground tank. The warm milk, fresh from the cows’ udders, heats the water used by the cafe. Walking us through the cheese-making process, we head underground to the vast cheese cellar, meet newborn calves and piglets and learn about innovative sustainable farming initiatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jul/16/10-of-the-best-island-retreats-off-scotlands-glorious-west-coast\">10 of the best Scottish island escapes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The leftover whey from the cheesemaking was once used to feed the pigs – until they found a better use for it.

    "description": "<p>First feature from director Donncha Gilmore is propelled by charismatic and natural performances by leads Adam Lunnon-Collery and Liath Hannon</p>",
    "content": "<p>This Irish gen Z romance begins so naturally, on Halloween in Dublin where Trinity College students are partying in an abandoned building. Rugby player Jason (Adam Lunnon-Collery) is chatting up aspiring indie film-maker Charlie (Liath Hannon); their conversation is laidback and intense, light-hearted and meaningful, like life. “I’m in character as an arrogant jock,” jokes Jason. We’ve just watched him taking stick in the locker room for having his ears pierced. Now you can practically see his heart thumping in his chest talking to Charlie, who is trans.</p> <p>The pair spend the night drifting through the city; they message a drug dealer (to score fireworks not drugs) and film each other with a Super 8 camera. Nobody hassles them. The movie is gentle and sweet until a sudden reveal – a twist that will require a stiff test of your ability to suspend disbelief, that almost verges on clumsy. But the charisma and lovely naturalism of performances from newcomers Lunnon-Collery and Hannon carries it off. Lunnon-Collery is particularly excellent as Jason, all warmth and charm on the surface.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqK_kT1Gkts\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WqK_kT1Gkts?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And fair play to the script by first-time feature director Donncha Gilmore, which gets more interesting as the film goes on, introducing ideas about regret and the unreliability of memory. Jason gets a jolt to his sense of identity: his certainty in himself as the good guy, a friend to the weak. He experiences a wave of shame over something from his past, events that he has reshaped in his memory to take the sting out. An impressive debut.</p> <p>• Girls &amp; Boys is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas from 19 September.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kaitlin Olson’s turn as an extremely intelligent, glamorous crime-solver isn’t always the most believable. But it’s crowd-pleasing TV that’s slick, easy on the eye and highly watchable</p>",
    "content": "<p>Will we ever grow bored of the savant sleuth? I suspect not – the satisfaction of witnessing a fantastically gifted person crack absurdly complex cases is one of fiction’s most reliable draws. As ever, our screens are swarming with them: in the past year alone we’ve been introduced to Ludwig, David Mitchell’s puzzle-setter turned incredibly astute (if reluctant) detective; been reunited with Natasha Lyonne’s human lie-detector Charlie Cale in Poker Face; and crossed paths once again with brainiac attorney Elsbeth, whose forays into policing are chronicled in the Good Wife spin-off of the same name.</p> <p>Also back for more mental gymnastics is Morgan Gillory, the protagonist of breezy procedural High Potential, which returns for a second season. With an IQ of 160 – giving her “high intellectual potential” (Mensa typically requires a score of about 130) – Morgan’s ability to unravel mind-bendingly complicated sequences of events is downright astonishing. Yet there’s something a little different about this particular clever-clogs crimestopper. Ever since an antisocial drug addict by the name of Sherlock Holmes set the genius detective tone, such characters have usually had a few <em>issues</em>. Ludwig is reclusive, his talents tempered by intense awkwardness. Cale is a chaotic, commitment-phobic outsider partial to a drink or two, while Elsbeth is a no-filter weirdo who gives people the creeps.</p> <p>Morgan – played by Kaitlin Olson (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Hacks) – has no comparable weaknesses. When we first meet her she’s working as a cleaner in the offices of the LAPD. After accidentally knocking over a pile of investigation notes and spotting some serious errors, she leaves a clue behind to point the officers in the right direction. Soon, she’s recruited to work alongside the police, where she duly solves a series of extraordinarily labyrinthine crimes with practically no assistance. Morgan is not just inordinately smart, she’s also a fearless, charismatic, glamorous, gorgeous go-getter with flawless instincts and off-the-charts emotional intelligence. She may be a little<em> </em>pushy at times, but now she’s in the business of saving lives and catching killers, a bit of urgency isn’t exactly inappropriate.</p> <p>If Morgan is practically perfect in every way, the same can’t be said for her life – initially, at least. A single mother of three, she struggles to make ends meet, and mostly uses her mind palace to get the most out of her coupon-assisted supermarket shop. Motherhood can, of course, stymie women’s professional lives, but Morgan’s willingness to put up with the demands and pay of a minimum-wage job doesn’t quite ring true. Similarly hard to buy is the show’s longest narrative thread: underpinning all her disparate cases is Morgan’s determination to track down the father of her eldest child, who disappeared without a trace 15 years ago. Despite her incredible powers of deduction, she hasn’t the foggiest idea where he is.</p>    <p>But High Potential isn’t overly concerned with realism. Made by ABC in the US, this is slick, narcotic network TV. It’s crowd-pleasing and easy on the eye, the sort of thing you’d traditionally associate more with ITV than BBC Two. Morgan’s new colleagues are uniformly nice, two-dimensional guys: suave detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata), investigators Daphne and Oz, plus Lt Selena Soto (Scrubs’ Judy Reyes), possibly the most reasonable and least fearsome police chief in cop drama history. No antiheroes, no edge: the vibe is cosy and heartwarming and rather basic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/23/high-potential-review-kaitlin-olson-disney-plus\">High Potential review – joyous, gorgeous, desperately needed trash TV </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously, the crimes aren’t cosy or heartwarming or basic. The season one finale saw Morgan taunted by a kidnapper who forced her to solve ludicrously difficult puzzles to save the lives of his victims. He returns in the opening double bill here, abducting a young mother on her way home from a night out – but his real target is clearly Morgan, whom he sees as a worthy opponent in his real-life game of chess. Watching her get tantalisingly close to outwitting this man is tense and thrilling, but something this out-there requires a watertight ending. The question is: is High Potential as clever as its protagonist?</p> <p>In a word, no. The show is very good at keeping the suspense going, but it can’t quite stick the landing, and the storyline concludes with a preposterous gotcha. Still, there’s always next time. (In fact, Morgan’s subsequent case – although equally bananas – is better thought through, ending with a neat and surprisingly moving climax.) The quality of the plotting may be a tad inconsistent, but like her many predecessors and peers, this virtuoso citizen detective can always be relied upon to save the day.</p> <p>• High Potential is on Disney+ now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Good morning. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">arrived in Britain last night</a>, landing with his wife, Melania, at Stansted airport and then taking a helicopter to central London. But he had an advance party: the mass of Maga political messages that have been picked up and repurposed by some fellow travellers, namely those of the British nationalist right.</p> <p>British politicians have imitated their frankly sexier US cousins for decades, of course. But something distinctive to the Trump era has been particularly apparent in recent months: the borrowing of an inescapably American political style in order to implant it in a political culture that barely knows what to make of it.</p> <p>It’s been visible across the spectrum of the right for a while, from Kemi Badenoch to Tommy Robinson, but it was especially obvious at Saturday’s far-right rally in London, which Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/uk-faces-fight-of-our-times-after-far-right-march-says-keir-starmer\">belatedly said yesterday</a> represents the “fight of our times between patriotic national renewal and decline and toxic division”. Participants wore Maga hats, heard speeches from Elon Musk and Stephen Bannon, and, as Daniel Boffey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-london-transatlantic\">sets out here</a>, paid tribute to the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. For supporters and opponents alike, Trump’s trip to the UK may look like a glimpse of the politics they would like to bring here as well.</p> <p>What’s far less clear is how much all this means to the wider voting public, who may not know their Bannons from their bunions – and whether it is a useful style for political actors whose appeal is based on relentless nativism. As Donald Trump meets the king today, and affirms that his main interest in the UK is as a kind of ossified theme park, today’s newsletter – with the help of Aamna Mohdin – asks what the British right wants from him.

Reform’s promise of Doge-style units to root out council waste. “Woke” supplanting “political correctness”. Tories calling on the government to “release the Mandelson-Epstein files”. Kemi Badenoch and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/02/blue-labour-group-urges-ministers-root-out-dei-win-over-reform-voters\">Blue Labour</a> warning about the dangers of “DEI” instead of “positive discrimination”. Even the assertion that a national flag is a straightforward emblem of patriotism rather than a potentially divisive symbol, a claim with a more plausible lineage in the US, where schoolchildren pledge allegiance to it every day, than it has here.</p> <p>There are myriad recent examples of rightwing political discourse making the trip across the Atlantic and taking up residence in the UK. The strangest thing about it is that very little effort is made to explain the more obscure parts of it to a local audience, or to disguise the unmistakably Trumpy associations in a country where he remains pretty unpopular. So why is the right so attracted to a style that turns so much of the public off?</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The history</strong></p> <p>It would be wrong to suggest that a fascination with American politics is a singularly rightwing phenomenon. “There’s been a magnetic attraction to American politics in Britain for a long time,” said Robert Saunders, a political historian at Queen Mary University of London. “You think of Gordon Brown holidaying in Cape Cod, or the influence Bill Clinton had on Tony Blair.” We might add the enduring liberal obsessions with JFK, Barack Obama and The West Wing.</p> <p>Journalist and author Daniel Trilling told Aamna<strong> </strong>that as recently as last year, “there was an idea that the incoming Keir Starmer Labour government would be the deputy to this revived US liberalism under Joe Biden. The Atlantic alliance was strong again and they were going to sort out Ukraine and the rest of it. So when the political weather in America changes, so it does here.”</p> <p>But those habits were really about strategy, and conversations among political obsessives – not the messages they deliberately shared with the mostly indifferent public. “It has certainly ramped up to a new level recently,” Saunders said. “And that is largely happening on the right.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What’s different now</strong></p> <p>One obvious reason populists, extremists and their imitators look to the US for inspiration is that their politics are further advanced there than anywhere else in the English-speaking world. “American far-rightism is more developed in terms of actually wielding power,” Trilling said. “So it’s not surprising that it influences the development of the far right here and elsewhere.” As Sadiq Khan says in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-londoners-donald-trump-politics\">an opinion piece for the Guardian</a>, Trump has “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.</p> <p>“That’s the most straightforward explanation,” Saunders said. “It’s just a visible and exciting model of success for the right. The Tories are staring into the abyss after the worst defeat in their history; Reform is on the rise, but they still only have five MPs. What this language embodies is what the right can do not just electorally, but culturally – it’s part of a project that’s not just about winning elections, but reshaping the entire landscape.”</p> <p>That nihilist streak is anathema to old-fashioned one-nation conservatives. But that group is now a political irrelevance, and their successors find alliances across the same borders they’re so keen to put on lockdown. “They share online spaces in a way that obviously wasn’t true 20 years ago,” Saunders said. “They are radicalised by the company they keep. And in a very concrete way, Tommy Robinson’s revival is obviously linked to Elon Musk reactivating Robinson’s X account.”</p> <p>All that might point to one reason for adopting a style that is so baffling to so many people: political actors are no longer fighting for a majority, but for the attention of the<strong> </strong>share of the public who will give them the time of day. That engagement is inevitably deepest among the perpetually online.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The political project</strong></p> <p>This is not a merely rhetorical relationship, said Trilling. “There are obvious shared aims between far-right populists in the UK and US. Going back at least to 2016, the big populist upsets of that year: Trump getting elected and the Brexit referendum being won by leave – the key figures behind those knew one another and talked about these things as part of a shared project.</p> <p>“The far-right position then, which is now becoming the mainstream right position, is that globalisation went too far, it ended up weakening our own economies and diluting our national identity through mass immigration, and what’s needed is a restoration and reinforcing of the borders.” Similar trends can be seen in national conservative movements across Europe, whose adherents have picked up the same Maga idioms from <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250417-live-italian-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-meets-trump-white-house\">Italy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/make-europe-great-again-hungary-sets-scene-eu-presidency\">Hungary</a>.</p> <p>Evidence for that shared project was visible in the appearances by Steve Bannon and Musk at Saturday’s rally, as well as JD Vance’s notorious intervention in European politics, and meeting with the AfD leader Alice Weidel, in Munich earlier this year. But it is also apparent in the financial support <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/68486/dark-money-donald-trump-british-right-farage\">flowing from wealthy Trump supporters</a> to rightwing British thinktanks – and which previously funded Tommy Robinson as he sought restoration to the national political stage.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The risks for the right</strong></p> <p>Even if it gets their supporters amped up, there are limits to the utility of this style for the right. “They should be a bit cautious,” Saunders said. “There’s a danger for any nationalist movement in looking like the branch office of a foreign power, and if you look like somebody else’s mini-me, you have a problem.” He pointed to the example of Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, who was eventually interned because of suspicions that his first loyalties were to Germany. “That’s why Farage is so personally important,” Saunders said. “As a recognisably British character who it’s harder to define as a puppet.”</p> <p>Then there’s the question of what policy prescription even those who might give the far right a hearing actually want. “The Maga movement is much more ‘let’s just slash everything away’,” Trilling said. “But in Britain, I don’t think most people, including a lot of those who were at that protest last Saturday, think about their relationship to the state in the same way. Opinion polls do seem to bear out that people in Britain, generally across the political spectrum, tend to favour higher social spending from the government.”</p> <p>The question, then, is whether any branch of the right can yoke the thrill of Trumpy nihilism to a persuasive claim that they care about things like the NHS, in a more authentically British tone of voice. But it remains to be seen whether they can transcend the same thing they deplore in their country: a cosmopolitan, magpie spirit, addicted to aspects of a foreign culture even as they dismiss them.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>After the death of <strong>Robert Redford</strong> (above) at 89, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">Peter Bradshaw pays tribute</a> to a “supremely beautiful movie star” (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-a-life-in-pictures\">life in pictures</a> proves it) who was also “always an outlier”. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>In Knowsley, where <strong>healthy life expectancy</strong> is about 54 years, decades of social and economic decline have transformed one of Labour’s safest seats into what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/labour-safe-seat-reform-constituency-knowsley-liverpool\">Kirsty Major found</a> now feels like one of Reform’s newly minted constituencies. <em><strong>Aamna</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Educators across the world are working in dangerous and febrile conditions.

    "description": "<p>Enzo Maresca’s side return to the site of the club’s first Champions League win but the team face a battle against their former striker</p>",
    "content": "<p>A trip to the Allianz Arena offers Chelsea fond memories of the greatest night in their history, a meeting with two what‑might‑have-beens and a swift reunion with a player desperate to prove they were wrong to let him go.</p> <p>Perhaps Enzo Maresca will be feeling nervous if his team have to face Nicolas Jackson when they open their Champions League campaign against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. There are plenty of examples of loanees coming back to haunt their parent club in the tournament and Jackson will not be short of motivation if he features against Chelsea less than a month since he left on loan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/15/emanuel-emegha-chelsea-fresh-fury-strasbourg-ligue-1\">Emanuel Emegha’s move to Chelsea provokes fresh fury at Strasbourg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The striker has a point to prove, particularly after the drama around his move. It all seemed so simple when Jackson flew to Germany on the morning of 30 August. Bayern had reached an agreement to sign him on loan with an option to buy, only for the situation to change when Liam Delap sustained a hamstring injury against Fulham a few hours later. The deal was off. Delap’s injury was serious and Chelsea did not want to gamble on heading into a busy autumn schedule with João Pedro as their only fit striker.</p> <p>Yet Jackson had no interest in coming back to play second fiddle to João Pedro, who had in effect replaced him after joining from Brighton in June. He remained in Bavaria and was rewarded for his persistence when new negotiations ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/nicolas-jackson-gets-his-wish-after-chelsea-and-bayern-munich-agree-loan-move\">Bayern agreeing to sign</a> the Senegal international, with a €65m (£56m) obligation to buy that will be triggered if he reaches a certain number of appearances.</p> <p>Sense prevailed. Chelsea had little to gain from making an unsettled player stay, especially after previously making clear they were happy to cash in. Jackson would not have been in a good frame of mind if he had flown back to London. The signs had hardly been encouraging during the Club World Cup. A reckless red card moments after coming on during Chelsea’s defeat by Flamengo in the group phase was indicative of Jackson’s mood.</p> <p>It was not a surprise that Maresca’s patience ran out after Jackson’s second dismissal in three games. The question, though, is whether Chelsea have left themselves short. Marc Guiu, recalled from a brief loan at Sunderland, was not on the bench for the draw at Brentford last Saturday. Jackson’s departure leaves a hole with Delap out. Jackson, signed from Villarreal two years ago, was no dud. His finishing was haphazard but he scored 24 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, linked with Cole Palmer and was often a handful for centre-backs. “My perfect No 9 is exactly Nicolas Jackson,” Maresca said in April.</p> <p>It soon transpired that Vincent Kompany was also a fan. Bayern wanted cover for Harry Kane and have found a versatile option. Jackson is capable of shifting wide and played with Kane when he made his debut as a half-time substitute against Hamburg last Saturday.</p>    <p>Becoming more clinical is the obvious target for the 24-year-old. Hopefully he can pay close attention to Kane in training. Bayern, meanwhile, are hoping to tap into Jackson’s knowledge of Chelsea. There has also been talk in Germany of Kompany asking Jackson for tips about Maresca’s tactics and instructions.</p> <p>This is a fixture with an edge. Chelsea’s return to the Champions League after a two-year absence brings them back to the ground where they won it for the first time, stirring memories of when they upset Bayern in their own back yard in 2012. Maresca’s players should not have an inferiority complex. Frank Lampard’s Chelsea were overpowered when they met Hansi Flick’s Bayern in the last 16 five years ago but Maresca’s version travel to Germany as world champions and have invested heavily in their talented young squad.</p> <p>It promises to be an intriguing tactical battle between two Pep Guardiola disciples. It would not be a surprise if Maresca uses the model that flummoxed Paris Saint‑Germain in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double\">Club World Cup final</a>, with Palmer pushing to the right and Reece James joining Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in a powerful midfield. Can Kompany respond? The Belgian won the league in his first season at Bayern but has his doubters in England. Burnley’s sorry Premier League campaign under Kompany is not easily forgotten, though it is worth pointing out that the former Manchester City player has admirers at Chelsea. They have twice considered appointing him: first when they sacked Graham Potter in April 2023, then when they were looking to replace Mauricio Pochettino a year later and ended up going for Maresca.</p> <p>The main concern around Kompany, who joined Bayern a week before Chelsea appointed Maresca, was whether he was flexible enough. Bayern have had no such complaints. They scored 99 league goals last season and will throw a varied attack at Chelsea. Luis Díaz, the former Liverpool winger, is a familiar threat. Michael Olise, who will test Marc Cucurella on the right, is another of the game’s subplots.</p> <p>The winger has had to graft since leaving Chelsea’s academy when he was 14. His journey has not been simple but the 23-year-old has matured and could easily have ended up back at Chelsea. They tried to trigger his release clause at Crystal Palace in 2023 and were beaten to his signature by Bayern a year later.</p> <p>Olise is one who got away. He has thrived at Bayern, providing goals, assists and dazzling trickery. Chelsea will have to be at their best. Kompany, Jackson and Olise will be out to show them what they’re missing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The push to build a $945m home for the first AFL team in Tasmania has hit a major hurdle, with the proposed stadium condemned by the state’s planning commission as a “monolithic” blot on Hobart’s landscape and cultural heritage.</p> <p>The damning report comes as the state’s premier, Jeremy Rockliff, admitted on Wednesday that the cost of the development had blown out by almost 20%, to $1.13bn.</p> <p>In its final report released this week, the Tasmanian Planning Commission concluded that the benefits of the stadium at Macquarie Point in Hobart were outweighed by its social, environmental and financial costs.</p> <p>Construction of the proposed 23,000-seat venue was scheduled to begin next year, with the Tasmanian Devils’ first game in the new arena due in 2029.</p> <p>The AFL views the Hobart stadium as a non-negotiable condition for Tasmania’s entry into the competition from 2028, but the development has been criticised on multiple fronts.</p> <p>The Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO), located just 170 metres from the site, commissioned two independent acoustic studies. Both warned that without significant mitigation, sound spill and vibration from the stadium could disrupt performances, recordings and filming activities well beyond the stadium’s 2029 opening.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The TSO declined to comment on Wednesday but said in October 2024 that “there’s no precedent in the world that we know of for a concert hall having a 23,000-people stadium 170 metres from its stage”.</p> <p>The Tasmanian RSL has focused on the impact the stadium’s 54-metre-high dome would have on sightlines of the Hobart cenotaph, Australia’s oldest war memorial.</p> <p>Renderings from Cox Architecture show the stadium dome looming over the site, potentially altering the visual experience of Anzac Day dawn services.</p> <p>The commission sided with the RSL, concluding that the adverse effects on the cenotaph, as well as heritage-listed buildings in Hunter Street, the Royal Engineers Building and the general character of Sullivans Cove, were unacceptable.</p> <p>The report warned of “irrevocable and unacceptable adverse impacts” on the surrounding communities and businesses and questioned the stadium’s ability to activate the precinct outside major events.</p> <p>“The panel does not consider that the stadium building will be iconic, as claimed by the [AFL],” the report concluded.</p> <p>On the financial cost, the commission estimated the project would saddle Tasmania with a $1bn debt, rising to $1.8bn over a decade, far exceeding the state government’s pledged contribution of $375m.</p> <p>With both political parties supporting the proposed stadium, its path through the lower house was assured. However, with the release of the commission’s damning report, major push-back is expected in the independent-dominated upper house.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/02/noise-from-new-hobart-afl-stadium-will-ruin-symphony-orchestras-historic-concert-hall-ceo-fears\">‘No precedent in the world’: Hobart concert hall opposes ‘noisy’ AFL stadium being built 170 metres from its stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rockliff said the planning commission’s report “massively underestimated” the social and economic benefits of the stadium, the Tasmanian Devils AFL and AFLW teams and a “supercharged events industry”.</p> <p>“Stadiums are complex, and this is the reason why across the nation special laws are used to approve them, instead of the traditional planning scheme,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>“It is now time for MPs to have their say. As a growing state, reaching for aspiration and opportunity for young people, we must pursue ambitious projects like that at Macquarie Point.</p> <p>“It will create jobs, boost our tourism and hospitality sector, secure world-class entertainment and keep our economy strong. It is time to get on with the job.”</p> <h2>Transport, noise and access issues</h2> <p>The state Labor leader, Josh Willie, said his party maintainted its support for the Tasmanian taskforce report, released in 2020, that outlined the business case for the team and the stadium being based in Hobart. But Willie said the planning commission’s report had raised “significant challenges” that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>“We need to see a response from the government,” he said.</p> <p>“We want to take our time to consider this report, and I think that’s what Tasmanians would expect from us.</p> <p>“The premier has outlined a number of challenges himself today, whether it’s transport, whether it’s noise, whether it’s access. We’ve got concerns around the financing and engineering of this project. I want to see the premier lifting his game. He needs to take Tasmanians on a journey. Clearly, it has been mishandled to this point.”</p> <p>The Greens’ sports spokesperson, Vica Bayley, said that after the commission’s damning findings, the premier should ditch the plan that would see Tasmanians taxed for the next 30 years to service the debt.</p> <p>“The premier can’t keep pretending his deal with the AFL isn’t a dud,” Bayley said on Wednesday.</p> <p>“On the back of this recommendation, he needs to renegotiate it. Tasmanians want AFL and AFLW teams, but not the stadium.</p> <p>“Labor need to rip up the blank cheque they’ve given the Liberals to build this stadium. They must show they’ve listened to Tasmanians and the planning commission, and finally take a stand against this mega-project that is both a budget bomb and risk to Hobart’s unique characteristics.”</p> <p>An AFL spokesperson on Wednesday said the Devils continued “to make great progress”.</p> <p>“More than 210,000 members have signed up and pledged their support, signifying great momentum and backing for the club,” they said in a statement.</p> <p>“A clear component of the licence bid from the Tasmanian taskforce was a new roofed stadium at Macquarie Point with a capacity of at least 23,000. The AFL’s continued position is that this is a condition for the grant of the 19th licence.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

And they should keep investing in the future of young people who want a job in a mine or resource sector in Queensland,” he said.</p> <p>The Mining and Energy Union (MEU) accused the company of “using coal workers and communities as pawns in its fight with the Queensland government over royalties”.</p> <p>“Coal prices have come back to more normal levels, but to fear-monger about a ‘crisis’ in coal is misleading and frankly shameful behaviour from BHP,” the MEU’s Queensland president, Mitch Hughes, said.</p> <p>“Our high-quality coal belongs to all Queenslanders, not to BHP. If BHP want to focus on other parts of their business, they should get out of the way and let someone else operate these great central Queensland mines.”</p> <p>The mine has been mothballed before, in 2012, and was reopened in 2020. Hughes said BMA has “form in turning this mine on and off to chase high coal prices, with no regard for the community or workforce impact”.</p> <p>The union said most of the 750 jobs being cut at BMA – which claims to be the largest private sector employer in central Queensland – are in corporate and support roles across BHP’s whole Queensland business, including rail, ports and coal, with about 72 coal production jobs affected.</p> <p>Other mines in the larger Saraji metallurgical coalmine complex will continue operating.</p> <p>Ellen Roberts, the national coordinator of community action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said BHP’s continued moves to expand coalmines in central Queensland exposed “the hollowness of the company’s claims that Queensland’s tiered royalties rate is to blame for its decision to sack workers”.</p> <p>“If royalties really were to blame, BHP would not be trying to build three giant new, climate-wrecking coal projects,” she said.</p> <p>The company has several applications for mine expansions before the state government for development assessment, including two at the same Saraji mining complex. If approved they would permit the company to mine about 110m and 33m tonnes of coal respectively, running until 2045 and 2055.</p> <p>“Federal and state governments should not give BHP approval for new coal projects when it is simultaneously mothballing the mines it already operates,” Roberts said.</p> <p>BHP Mitsubishi Alliance is just the latest mining company to complain about royalties.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/21/qld-state-budget-2022-queensland\">Under the scheme</a>, miners pay a 20% royalty for prices above $175 a tonne, 30% for prices above $225 a tonne, and 40% for prices above $300 a tonne, well above comparable states. The scheme raised more than $10bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/queensland-state-budget-2023-speech-announced-delivered-by-qld-treasurer-cameron-dick\">for the state budget in a single year</a> at its peak.

    "content": "<p>The New South Wales government has announced major changes to NSW’s planning system in a bid to speed up housing approvals and meet its target to build 377,000 homes by 2029.</p> <p>“Sydney is the second-least affordable city in the world,” the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said as he announced an overhaul of the 50-year-old Environmental Planning and Assessment Act on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Families, young people, downsizers, are all negatively impacted by the myriad maze of planning regulations … and it’s having a massive impact on our economy and our community.</p> <p>“Between 2016 and 2021, Sydney lost twice as many young people between the ages of 30 and 40 as it gained: 35,000 came to Sydney but 70,000 left. This is the next generation of young Australians, the people that we want writing the next chapter in Sydney and NSW’s history.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The state government has been talking to the opposition during the drafting process, but it is not yet clear whether the reforms will have bipartisan support. The devil will be in the details, but here’s what we know so far.</p> <h2>Don’t sweat the small stuff</h2> <p>The proposed reforms will increase the types of projects that don’t require a development application to be approved by councils.</p> <p>NSW already allows “complying developments” – such as two-storey houses, renovations, dual occupancies and townhouses – to be built without formal council approval.</p> <p>Instead, the development must meet detailed specifications set out in a State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp). These include things like setback from the street and height. The development can then get a tick from a council or certifier that it meets the Sepp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/woollahra-train-station-sydney-city-cbd-eastern-suburbs-line\">Plan to finish forgotten Woollahra train station and build 10,000 homes won’t combat Sydney’s affordability crisis, critics say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes announced on Wednesday would allow projects with minor non-compliance issues to be fast-tracked as well. Councils would need to deal with them within 10 days, or they would be deemed to have been approved.</p> <p>The government says it doesn’t want the planning system “to be sweating the small stuff”.</p> <h2>A middle path</h2> <p>The government plans to introduce a “targeted assessment pathway” for development, where strategic planning and community consultation have already taken place.</p> <p>Proposals that have already been through a public process – for example, a precinct design process – won’t have to go through a full development application (DA) if they have already consulted.</p> <h2>A single door for major developments</h2> <p>At the moment, a development like a new housing estate needs to deal with up to 22 state agencies, the government says.</p> <p>Labor wants a single agency – the Development Coordination Agency – to act as a doorway to all approving agencies such as the planning and environment departments, Sydney Water and the Rural Fire Service.</p> <p>Minns said that sometimes agencies imposed contradictory conditions on developments. The premier cited the example of the RFS saying trees should be cleared to deal with bushfire risk, while the planning department insisted on trees for cooling.</p> <p>The government will also enshrine the Housing Delivery Authority in legislation. This means developers can apply to the planning department to take over approval of big housing developments, worth more than $60m, from councils, as state-significant developments.</p> <p>The planning minister, Paul Scully, said this means the state will have a permanent voice in driving housing in NSW. He said the authority had already declared 240 projects state significant since January, which had the potential to deliver 87,000 homes.</p> <h2>New objects and fewer appeals</h2> <p>The objects of the act will be amended to emphasise housing delivery, climate resilience and proportionality as desired outcomes of the planning system.</p> <p>The government says it will also “update” review processes and encourage disputes to be resolved outside of the land and environment court. Details are vague, but Scully suggested this could include a review by a different council officer.</p> <p>Regional planning panels would be abolished. They were introduced to examine “regionally significant developments” so that transport and services kept pace. They were independent of the minister.</p> <p>Local planning panels, which make decisions on behalf of councils, will remain, the government said.</p> <p>The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, says the Coalition will approach the bill in “good faith” and consider it in the party room. </p> <p>“I can’t emphasise enough how pro-housing, how pro-reform we are,” he said on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/sep/17/on-drugs-by-justin-smith-ruiu-review-a-philosophers-guide-to-psychedelics",
    "description": "<p>What if Descartes had melted his brain on acid? Find out in this mind-expanding exploration of drugs and formal philosophy</p>",
    "content": "<p>This book is a trip. Among other things, it copiously details all the drugs that the US-born professor of history and philosophy of&nbsp;science at the Université Paris Cité has ingested. They include psilocybin, LSD, cannabis; quetiapine and Xanax&nbsp;(for anxiety); venlafaxine, Prozac, Lexapro and tricyclics (antidepressants); caffeine (“I have drunk coffee every single day without fail since September 13, 1990”); and, at&nbsp;least for him, the always disappointing alcohol.</p> <p>The really trippy thing, though, is&nbsp;not so much Justin Smith-Ruiu’s descriptions of his drug experiences, but the fact that they’re written by a&nbsp;tough-minded analytic philosopher, one as&nbsp;familiar with AJ Ayer’s Foundations of Empirical Knowledge as Aldous Huxley’s mescaline-inspired The Doors of Perception. Moreover, they’re presented with the aim of melting the minds of his philosophical peers and the rest of us by suggesting that psychedelics dissolve our selves&nbsp;and make us part of cosmic consciousness, thereby rendering us free in the way the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza defined it&nbsp;(paraphrased by Smith-Ruiu as “an agreeable acquiescence in the way one’s own body is moving in the necessary order of things”).</p> <p>The melting metaphor is apt, since the primal scene of early modern western philosophy came when the 17th-century French thinker René Descartes melted a piece of wax. The&nbsp;lump may change its form, smell, length, breadth, and yet, Descartes supposed, we still claim to know that it is the same piece of wax. The knower&nbsp;can be wrong about all their perceptions involving this wax but not, Descartes argued, <em>that</em> they are thinking: this is the basis of his famous “I think therefore I am” – by&nbsp;means of which the French thinker&nbsp;made us the rational, science‑venerating beings we have&nbsp;been ever since.</p> <p>Smith-Ruiu, discombobulatingly, flips the script on the Cartesian thought experiment: what if, instead&nbsp;of melting the wax, Descartes had “melted his mind” with acid, or one of those hallucinogens starting to&nbsp;arrive in Europe across the Atlantic along with potatoes and tobacco, such&nbsp;as peyote or ayahuasca? What&nbsp;if&nbsp;he had not foregrounded rationality and instead extolled the imaginative powers that, Smith-Ruiu&nbsp;suggests, are&nbsp;unleashed by psychedelics? The&nbsp;west might have ended up seeing&nbsp;the world completely differently, and human beings as “infinite reservoirs of&nbsp;light and wisdom”.</p> <p>There’s more in Smith-Ruiu’s psychedelic experience, one might say, than is dreamt of in strait-laced colleagues’ philosophies. His thinking seems kin to such voguish, mind-blowing movements as Markus Gabriel’s new realism, and Timothy Morton’s implosive holism and object-oriented philosophy. Immanuel Kant claimed the transcendent was by definition behind an impenetrable veil, inferable perhaps but never knowable. We could never, in this world, see God. For Smith-Ruiu, psychedelics might help lift that veil. For that thought alone I’m amazed – and cheered – that he got tenure.</p> <p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that this is not one of those gonzo books typed while the author is out of their gourd. Smith-Ruiu is no Hunter S Thompson. It is called On Drugs but it was not written on drugs (apart, presumably, from some of the prescription meds he details above and the odd espresso hit). “I am as I write, sober, lucid, and entirely focused on the task at hand.”</p> <p>The book ends with a remarkable plot twist (philosophical spoiler alert!).&nbsp;In 2023, Smith-Ruiu attended Catholic mass for the first time in 40&nbsp;years at the church next door to his Paris apartment. His claim here is that&nbsp;the psychedelic experience is analogous to&nbsp;that of ritual worship: ordinary time&nbsp;is interpreted as a&nbsp;distortion, and during mass one might perceive, as he did on mushrooms, something like eternity. Another parallel is that one submits one’s will in church as on a psychedelic trip. He writes: “Psychedelics, like religion, like poetry are among other things an abandonment of the will to go it alone.” Smith-Ruiu is&nbsp;self-aware enough to note how absurd this sounds: that psychedelics have become his gateway drug to the&nbsp;Catholic church.</p> <p>And you don’t even need to take magic mushrooms from some geezer in a Dutch head shop (as Smith-Ruiu did) to melt your mind. He cites the opening of Proust’s novel À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when little Marcel dreamily imagines that he has become some of the things he&nbsp;has been reading about before nodding off – a church, a quartet, the&nbsp;rivalry between François I and Charles V – as an example of everyday&nbsp;psychedelia.</p> <p>That isn’t the only non-pharmaceutical way to expand your consciousness – you could try reading this extraordinary book, whose riches I can only hint at in this review.</p> <p>• On Drugs: Psychedelics, Philosophy, and the Nature of Reality by Justin Smith-Ruiu is published by Norton (£22). </p>",

    "description": "<p>From telling the insurers to accepting you may need to get the experts in, tips on dealing with the deceased’s property </p>",
    "content": "<h2><strong>Make it safe</strong></h2> <p>When someone close to you&nbsp;dies, be it a relative or a friend, practical considerations may be far from your mind. But you could quickly find that you have the responsibility of looking after, then clearing out, their home.</p> <p>How their possessions, property and finances will be dealt with should be outlined in the will, if there is one. This should also name who the executor or executors of the estate are – the people legally responsible for carrying out the wishes of the deceased. They will take responsibility for the property.</p> <p>Before the will is read it is important to ensure that it and other important paperwork such as property deeds, insurance documents and bank statements are kept safe if the person’s house or flat is going to be empty.</p> <p>As soon as you can, empty the fridge of perishable food and dispose of plants and flowers from inside the house. Cancel any regular deliveries such as milk and newspapers. Ensure the property is locked up and retrieve any spare keys from hiding places.</p>    <p>If there is no will, the most “entitled” person can apply to be the administrator. This will be the closest living relative, normally the&nbsp;spouse followed by any children over 18.</p> <h2><strong>Tell the insurer</strong></h2> <p>If the property is going to be empty it is important to contact the insurer once the homeowner dies.</p> <p>You may need to provide it with evidence that you are authorised to administer the property such as a death certificate or a lasting power of attorney document.</p> <p>You may have to take extra steps to ensure it is secure, such as draining the water system, checking any burglar alarm is working and keeping the heating to a suitable temperature during the winter.</p> <p>Most standard home insurance policies don’t fully cover properties left empty for more than 30 to 60 consecutive days. If that will be the case, an extension to the policy might be needed to prevent against fire, theft or flooding for example. The cost of this depends on the insurer.</p> <h2><strong>Sort as you go</strong></h2> <p>When you start the clear-out proper, be methodical and put items into categories. The will may say that some items such as jewellery are to be given to specific people, and so you may want to begin by finding these things.</p> <p>Just Clear, a London-based house clearance company, <a href=\"https://justclear.com/blog/04/15/2025/bereavement-house-clearance-guide/#HowLong\">suggests you work from room to room</a> and put items into categories as you go. You could get some cardboard boxes to sort the smaller things into.</p> <p>Some things such as furniture may have to be sold or auctioned off; others may be sent to a charity shop; things that have no use and are not wanted may only be appropriate for the tip. If in doubt about whether an item has any value, look it up online before you sling it in the recycling.</p>    <p>Even if you aren’t able to remove the items from the property, because probate is being dealt with, you can make an inventory of what is there. Once probate is confirmed, you can distribute the items to family members and friends of the&nbsp;deceased.</p> <h2><strong>Pay for help</strong></h2> <p>There are lots of reasons why you may want to get the experts in to do it for you. Clearing out the home of a loved one can be a daunting task, especially if you are dealing with a lifetime of possessions. Or you may live far away and may not be able to manage the whole thing yourself.</p> <p>House clearance firms specialise in taking the responsibility of emptying a home away from family or friends. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/03/treasure-hunters-the-enthralling-emotional-inside-story-of-a-house-clearance\">Brendan O’Shea, the chief executive of Just Clear</a>, says people sometimes think they can do the job themselves but then find they are swamped, or simply do not have the time.</p> <p>“We get calls from Australia, America – all over the world,” he says. Some people are very good at getting their affairs in order, others are very different. It is all down to the individual, O’Shea adds.</p> <p>“I’ve got clients who are prolonging the clearance process because they cannot emotionally deal with it. They can’t process it in their head. And when they do try to approach it, it gives them anxiety,” he says.</p> <p>Typically, a professional house clearance service should clear the property, taking over the sorting and recycling and, in some cases, moving items to an auction house. It may also sell items on your behalf, taking a commission in the&nbsp;process. You may also be able&nbsp;to&nbsp;get it to take care of cleaning&nbsp;of the property, too, if this&nbsp;is needed.</p>    <p>O’Shea says that an average three-bedroom house – in which one person was living – will take his company a day to clear. This would cost the estate £1,700 (plus VAT) and includes recycling charges, and haulage and labour, among other&nbsp;expenses.</p> <p>In some cases, the clearance turns up valuable items that loved ones did not know were there. O’Shea says his company found two Picasso ceramics in a house in Knightsbridge, London – they subsequently sold for £120,000.</p> <p>For those who believe that items in a home are worth more than they are, he says that auctioning them will show what the market values them at.He says an auction is a good way of finding out how much something is worth. You may think something is a valuable antique, but by taking it to an auction you can find out how much the market will pay for it.</p> <p>He says the low bar for entry to become a clearance company means it “is not a nice industry”. In order to distinguish between companies, look at online reviews for them and how long they have been in the&nbsp;business. Recommendations from local friends or relatives will also help you choose a good company.</p> <h2><strong>Inform organisations</strong></h2> <p>Some organisations will need to be told of the death. Many councils use the Tell Us Once system, which notifies most government organisations in one go. The registrar will give you the details and a number when you register the death. The system will tell HM Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Passport Office and the DVLA among others. You will need the personal details of the deceased, and possibly documents such as passport and driving licence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and optician</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/money-legal/legal-issues/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/\">Age UK</a> says if the council is not part of the service, you will have to contact the organisations yourself. The name of deceased can be put on the Bereavement Register, which removes them from mailing lists and stops advertising mail.</p> <p>You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and optician, as well as any charities to which they may have made subscription payments.</p> <h2><strong>Don’t rush</strong></h2> <p>Dealing with the death of a friend or a loved one does not have to be rushed. The insurer <a href=\"https://www.legalandgeneral.com/insurance/over-50-life-insurance/funeral-planning/clearing-a-house-after-death/\">L&amp;G advises people</a> to clear out a home with someone else and to do it over different days in order to avoid emotional fatigue. Just Clear says it&nbsp;can often take several weeks to sort through the remains of someone’s life and it is vital to give yourself time to reflect.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/bereavement-help-and-support\">Charities are available to help</a>. Cruse Bereavement Support has helplines to help those who have lost someone, while Marie Curie also has a helpline. <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/death-and-wills/dealing-with-the-financial-affairs-of-someone-who-has-died/\">Citizens Advice has advice</a> on the steps that need to be taken after a death.</p>",

For partnered pensioners, the payment will increase $21.40 to $813.90 each a fortnight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>For singles over 22, jobseeker payments will increase by $12.50 a fortnight, to a total of $793.60.</p> <p>You can check the full list off payments and increases on the <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/income-support-payments/resource/indexation-rates-september-2025\">Services Australia website.</a></p> <h2>Is it enough?</h2>  <p>The social services minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Australia’s welfare system was “ground in fairness”, which is why it is indexed.</p> <p>“Thanks to indexation, millions of Aussies will receive a boost to their payment to help them cover everyday costs like groceries and healthcare,” she said. “The government wants to help take the pressure off when it comes to cost of living.”</p> <p>But anti-poverty advocates argue the small rise in benefits will do little to help elevate the financial struggle millions of Australians are facing, calling for payments to be lifted in line with the Henderson poverty line of $660.72 a week for a single person.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/01/1-july-changes-2025-centrelink-payments-minimum-wage-road-fines-everything-financial-year\">1 July changes: minimum wage, Centrelink payments, parental leave, road fines and everything else coming for the 2025-26 financial year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welfare advocate Jeremy Poxon said CPI indexation does little to help “people in poverty”.</p> <p>“Politicians on both sides boast about indexation to pretend they’re doing something to boost people’s income,” Poxon said.</p> <p>“This is a deeply cynical and insulting exercise, designed to hide the fact that, in reality, government is starving the poor with some of the lowest welfare payments in the OECD.”</p> <h2>What’s happening with the deeming rate?</h2>  <p>The government uses deeming rates to calculate how much money pensioners make from their financial assets after they have retired. This is used to help determine how much their fortnightly pension will be.</p> <p>The lower the deeming rate, the more people can earn from their investments – shares, superannuation and any interest on money in the bank – without it affecting their payments.</p> <p>Deeming rates were cut in Covid, and have been paused ever since, but as part of a push to return them to pre-pandemic figures they will be increasing.</p> <p>“As Australians begin to feel the positive impacts of inflation easing, the government will now gradually return deeming rates to pre-pandemic settings,” a media release from Plibersek said in August.</p> <p>“From 20 September, a deeming rate of 0.75% will apply to financial assets under $64,200 for singles and $106,200 for couples combined. Assets over this amount will be deemed at a rate of 2.75%.</p> <p>“Even with these increases, the deeming rates will remain below historical pre-Covid averages.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<h2>Doc</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Witness</strong></p> <p>While we wait for the US smash The Pitt to reach UK screens, here’s a new medical drama starring Molly Parker as a doctor who suffers amnesia. After a car crash, Dr Amy Larsen forgets everything that happened in the last eight years of her life … including her divorce. She relies on her colleagues (some of whom she has crossed) and teenage daughter (whom she remembers as a nine-year-old) to help fill in the blanks – the good and the bad. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Stranded on Honeymoon Island</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Pour yourself a stiff one for week three of the Philippines-set reality show that takes two shots of Married at First Sight and mixes it with a glug of Love Island to create a sun-drenched but volatile cocktail. The latest wheeze to mess with the various newlyweds is to speedboat in some of their exes – a sure way to stir things up. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Madeleine McCann: Searching for the Prime Suspect</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>It has now been 18 years since Madeleine McCann’s unsolved disappearance but the public hunger for answers remains the same. This documentary focuses on Christian Brückner, who is set to be released from prison with no new charges despite the suspicions of the German authorities. But why can’t they prove anything? <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Donald Trump Show</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>While this series – which uses recent news footage, edited narratively without any voiceover – treats the second Trump presidency as an unfolding drama, its implications are very real and as serious as your life. This time, his willingness to ignore democratic norms extends to sending the National Guard to patrol LA and Washington DC. Terrifying. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Rumour</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong></p> <p>Who is the real Sally McGowan? For all our sakes, let’s hope that Joanna’s obsession finally finds her the answer as the juicy thriller concludes. Her husband starts to worry about her behaviour and she is fired from work, but Joanna (Rachel Shenton) remains undeterred in her quest. It concludes on Thursday. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Mudtown</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Alibi</strong></p> <p>The penultimate episode of this dark Welsh drama sees Claire (Erin Richards) learn some home truths from “the Tony Soprano of Newport”. But if anything’s going to make you uneasy, it may be the sight of Matthew Gravelle – AKA Broadchurch baddie Joe Miller – as a doting dad. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, </strong><strong>9pm, Film4</strong></p>    <p>Soon-to-be national treasure Emma Thompson gives a wonderfully candid performance in Sophie Hyde’s poignant drama about a late-in-life sexual awakening. Her widowed, retired teacher Nancy hires “aesthetically perfect” sex worker Leo (Daryl McCormack) for an afternoon in a hotel room in the hope of discovering a physical pleasure she never knew during her long marriage. There’s much more talking than sex, but the two leads perfectly balance the awkwardness, humour, tension and emotional mic drops that characterise their transactional encounters. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2>Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League Football: </strong><strong>Liverpool v Atlético Madrid, </strong><strong>7pm, TNT Sports 1 </strong>Bayern Munich v Chelsea is on TNT Sports 2.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The “too old, too slow” slight is as old as football. In the AFL era, Hawthorn in 1991 and Geelong in 2011 both played like they were insulted at the idea of being pensioned off. But by today’s standards, the age composition of those two premiership teams shouldn’t have been cause for concern. Michael Tuck was 38 but it felt like he’d been 38 since the early 1980s. Chris Mew was 30 and Gary Ayres turned 31 on grand final day. Within six months of that game, Dermott Brereton’s body was shot to bits. But he was still only 27. Similarly, the Geelong side of 2011 wasn’t the dad’s army that they’re sometimes remembered as, with only five 30 or older and Matthew Scarlett the oldest at 32.</p> <p>The Collingwood team that will run out in the preliminary final really is old. If Jeremy Howe plays, he’ll be the ninth player who is 30 or over. Two more, Jordan De Goey and Darcy Moore, will soon join them. It’s a trend we’re seeing in all sports. Tom Brady retired at 45. Novak Djokovic won a dozen grand slams in his 30s. Serena Williams won nine, including an Australian Open at 35 when she was pregnant.</p> <p>The truly solar stars – Brady, Djokovic, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kyrie Irving, Kelly Slater and Aaron Rodgers – are often fanatical about nutrition, sleep, supplementation and pesky little things like vaccines. Mason Cox (34), with the greatest respect, is no Ronaldo. And Brody Mihocek (held together by masking tape at 32) doesn’t move like Djokovic. But it’s worth looking at what Collingwood is doing here. Is it simply a case of having one last throw at the stumps before a glut of retirements? Are they trained differently to players at other clubs? And do the daily habits of their oldest players rub off on everyone else?</p>    <p>The role Collingwood’s high-performance manager has played in prolonging so many careers cannot be underestimated. Jarrod Wade arrived at Collingwood two weeks after Craig McRae. He’d been working in rugby league for more than half a decade and he was adamant that AFL players weren’t physically resilient enough. He often quoted Wayne Bennett: “You don’t have to feel good to train good.” This was at odds with the conditioning mentality at many clubs, who’d often be hyper-cautious with sore players, especially older ones. Many were shocked by the volume and intensity of his first preseason. But he was more than some old school sadist throwing eggs at the wall and persisting with the ones that didn’t break. He had the right blend of data and intuition. Crucially, he had a core group of self-driven, physically and mentally resilient senior players who ate up the hard work. By halfway through the following season, they were mowing teams down in final quarters.</p> <p>More than anything, he had Scott Pendlebury. Earlier this year, the 37-year-old did a podcast with Mark Howard, an off-season-in-the-life type arrangement that provided some insights into why he’s so durable and so good. When he wasn’t in the sauna, he was having an afternoon nap. When he wasn’t doing cold plunges, he was doing mobility exercises. You can’t help but wonder how many professional athletes, especially 37-year-old fathers, could adhere to that kind of regime.</p> <p>But Pendlebury relishes it. One of Novak’s former coaches referred to the tennis player’s “continuity of obsession”. Like the Serbian champion, the overwhelming impression was that none of this was a chore for Pendlebury, that he loved optimising every hour, every calorie and every kilometre.</p>    <p>Listening to a man itemise his hot/cold routine is just about the most boring thing a grown adult can do. But it’s the tedious, meticulous stuff in late October that allows him the full expression of his game in September. And it’s a joy to watch him play in moments like that – to watch him conducting a game, to watch him compute and solve the game’s problems, and to navigate its chokepoints. The similarly ageless Patrick Dangerfield leaves divots, bruises and trauma. Pendlebury doesn’t leave a trace. He hovers above the game, popping in where he sees fit, like a cat hopping on a lap.</p> <p>A few days before the 2023 grand final, he did a podcast with the journalist Jay Clark and Ross Lyon. Just sitting in a chair and sipping from a water bottle, he radiated the kind of energy you often see in experienced, emotionally regulated athletes on the eve of competition. He looked like a man who’s spent the past six months sauna-ing, cold-plunging and analysing stoppages. He looked like the least likely footballer imaginable to play the game in his head before he ran out.</p> <p>Lyon saw it too. “You look like a title fighter,” he laughed. “Lean, dog hungry, ready to go.” That’s Pendlebury and that’s Collingwood right now – hungry, wily and yes, old, a team raging against the dying of the light.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from Guardian Australia’s free weekly AFL email, From the Pocket. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">To get the full version, just visit this page and follow the instructions</a></strong></em></p></li> </ul>",

The Guardian will eliminate two-thirds of its emissions by 2030 and reduce our impact on nature</strong></h2> \n<p>Since 2020, our company greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 48%, putting us well on track to achieve our target of a 67% reduction by 2030. In the last reporting year, emissions fell by 9%.</p> \n<p>The biggest reductions so far in our plan have come from our print business, which now accounts for 64% of our total footprint, compared with 73% in 2020. As our business becomes more digital and more global, emissions from our digital products, IT operations and business travel will account for a larger proportion of emissions.</p> \n<p>We are committed to reducing all areas of our footprint, which is why we have developed a bespoke climate literacy course for our staff to empower all colleagues to take action in their area of the business.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. We will seek to decouple our business and finances from fossil-fuel extractive companies</strong></h2> \n<p>The Guardian has refused advertising from all fossil-fuel extractive companies since January 2020.</p> \n<p>The Guardian is supported by the Scott Trust and the returns from its endowment fund. The fund’s environmental strategy is focused on contributing to a reduction of emissions in the real world and to protecting nature and biodiversity. The fund has made significant investments in environmental solutions, with more than £100m now invested in areas ranging from cutting emissions in manufacturing processes to increasing the resilience of food systems in a warming world. Additionally, the fund has made a commitment to invest at least 3% of its value in natural capital and biodiversity solutions.</p> \n<p>The endowment’s environmental focus builds on work started in 2015 to divest from fossil fuels.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. We will be transparent with our progress</strong></h2> \n<p>We believe transparency is the key to tackling the climate crisis. By sharing our data, our successes and our challenges, we can be part of the global movement to make businesses accountable for their climate and nature impacts.</p> \n<p>In the past year we have:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Published <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/10/24/Sustainability_Report_2023.pdf\">our annual company emissions data</a>, explaining what drives our emissions and where they have risen and fallen</p></li> \n <li><p>Created a digital course, as part of an initiative by the <a href=\"https://sustainablejournalism.net/\">Sustainable Journalism Partnership</a>, sharing examples from experts across the Guardian of how to embed sustainability into journalism and media commercial operations</p></li> \n <li><p>Contributed our time and knowledge to working groups in the advertising industry that are working on better ways to measure the emissions impact of advertising</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>We open ourselves up to scrutiny by independent third parties, such as the <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/\">Science-Based Targets initiative</a> (SBTi) and B Corp, so they can assess the robustness of our targets and our internal policies.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After a cyber-attack rained on its summer, Marks &amp; Spencer is banking on fashion to brighten its autumn.</p> <p>A Prada-esque, crystal-embellished, charcoal V-neck cardigan (£46), a faux leather trenchcoat with a price tag of £90 – £6,810 less than the Burberry version – and a £36 short pleated skirt that offers a wearable take on Charli xcx’s “brat” styling will hit shop floors shortly.</p> <p>“We can be bolder because, while we continue to dominate in the over-55s, we’ve got new customers in the 35- to 55-year-old age range,” said Maddy Evans, the brand’s womenswear lead, at a showcase of the new collection in the run-up to London fashion week, which begins on Friday.</p>    <p>The store is relying on womenswear, which has been ticking upward in sales and credibility for two years, to lead a bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a devastating cyber-attack</a> that affected M&amp;S from April to August and is predicted to have cost the business £300m in profits.</p> <p>Evans said the retailer was aiming for two-thirds newness in store. “That basically means that if a customer walks in to see the new season, two-thirds of it she will never have seen before. The other third is core product – white T-shirts, skinny jeans, black wide-leg trousers, pieces that never go out of stock.”</p> <p>M&amp;S “sense-checked” trends for wearability, Evans added. The return of the miniskirt, as widely seen on city streets this summer, is reflected at the retailer, but “never unwearably short”. “We are shifting out of the midi skirt into shorter lengths, but our customer trusts us to make a short skirt that they feel good in,” she added.</p> <p>The head of womenswear design, Lisa Illis, said knowing which trends to ignore was as important as knowing which to pick up on. Waving to a rail of tonal rose, burgundy and chocolate knitwear, she said: “We avoid harder, sharper colours that are more difficult to wear, in favour of these flattering shades.”</p> <p>Leather – real and faux – features on coats, minidresses and skirts as well as shoes. The store had a hit at the beginning of this year, selling 20,000 pairs of £55 loafers, which offered an affordable take on the key shoe of the “quiet luxury” era. Investment in loafers has been ramped up by 40% for the coming winter.</p> <p>In denim – where high-waisted styles rule – the under-£30 price point remains key, “although we’re seeing more opportunity at £45-£49, when the product is right”.</p> <p>To respond more nimbly to demand, the company has substantially shifted production from China, Vietnam and Cambodia to “nearshore” manufacture in Turkey, Morocco and Egypt.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Witty, foul-mouthed, camp and punky, it was the 00s answer to slick superclubs and the rock patriarchy. As its rough, raw sound returns, the scene’s eyeliner-ed heroes, from Peaches to Jonny Slut, relive its excesses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jonny Melton knew that his club night Nag Nag Nag had reached some kind of tipping point when he peered out of the DJ booth and spotted Cilla Black on the dancefloor. “I think that’s the only time I got really excited,” he laughs. “I was playing the Tobi Neumann remix of Khia’s My Neck, My Back, too – ‘my neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack’ – and there was Cilla, grooving on down. You know, it’s not Bobby Gillespie or Gwen Stefani, it’s fucking <em>Cilla Black</em>. I’ve got no idea how she ended up there, but I’ve heard since that she was apparently a bit of a party animal.”</p> <p>It seems fair to say that a visit from Our Cilla was not what Melton expected when he started Nag Nag Nag in London in 2002. A former member of 80s goth band Specimen who DJed under the name Jonny Slut, he’d been inspired by a fresh wave of electronic music synchronously appearing in different locations around the world. Germany had feminist collective Chicks on Speed and DJ Hell with his groundbreaking label International DeeJay Gigolos. France produced Miss Kittin and The Hacker, Vitalic and Electrosexual. Britain spawned icy electro-pop quartet Ladytron and noisy, sex-obsessed trio Add N To (X). Canada spawned Tiga and Merrill Nisker, who abandoned the alt-rock sound of her debut album Fancypants Hoodlum and, with the aid of a Roland MC-505 “groovebox”, reinvented herself as Peaches. New York had performance art inspired duo Fischerspooner and a collection of artists centred around DJ and producer Larry Tee, who gave the sound a name: electroclash.</p> <p>The lyrics tended to be witty, occasionally foul-mouthed and very camp. The sound had house music, techno, 80s synth-pop and electro in its DNA, but boasted a rough-hewn, punky edge, the latter partly down to attitude and partly down to the era’s technological advances. “It isn’t like today, where you can take an idea to a playable version in five hours on a laptop,” says Larry Tee, “but you could record something releasable in your bedroom, you could get a Juno 106 [synthesizer] and alter the sounds and fry and burn them. I’m convinced the best electroclash tracks happened because people made mistakes, the levels were too loud or there was something wrong.”</p>    <p>It was audibly a reaction to something. In Britain, it felt a world apart from the increasingly slick dance scene of superclubs and superstar DJs. In New York, Larry Tee suggests it was a shift away from “trance and tribal house”. For Peaches, who had recorded her 2000 album The Teaches of Peaches in her bedroom, “lying in bed, smoking weed, masturbating and making beats”, it was music made by “marginalised, queer people … who were fed up with a system that was telling us ‘rock music has to be by four beautiful boys down the line from the Rolling Stones, electronic music has to be completely serious like you’re doing brain surgery while turning buttons’. Where was the punk? And for me, I can’t think of another time in music history where women were so at the forefront – Chicks on Speed, Miss Kittin, Tracy + the Plastics. It’s always like, ‘This dude did this’, you know?”</p> <p>Whatever it was an answer to – superclubs or rock’s traditional patriarchy – electroclash seemed to find an audience quickly. It wasn’t the only music Melton and his fellow DJs played at Nag Nag Nag – as underlined by a new 5CD box set, When the 2000s Clashed, they were equally wont to drop old punk singles, early industrial music or the Neptunes’ exploratory R&amp;B – but electroclash was the club’s sonic backbone, and the night was an immediate success. Boosted by approving reviews first in the gay press, then the style magazines, its initial clientele – “a few old goths and some art students in their mum’s old curtains,” according to Melton – were soon joined by a succession of celebrities: Kate Moss, Alexander McQueen, Pet Shop Boys, Boy George, Björk. Perhaps inevitably, it attracted comparisons to celebrated New Romantic hangout the Blitz. “But there was no door policy, no guest list,” demurs Melton. “I didn’t want any of that exclusivity shit. It wasn’t posey at all, there was more a feeling of abandon. It was very hedonistic.”</p> <p>“It was the epitome of amazingness, this incredible melting pot of every kind of character,” says Concetta Kirschner, better known as rapper Princess Superstar, who turned up at Nag Nag Nag while promoting her 2002 UK hit Bad Babysitter. The club had an immediate impact on her sound. “It gave me a shot of freedom. I felt like there were a lot of tightly defined rules in hip-hop. But after Nag Nag Nag, I felt I could experiment, be whatever I wanted, rap over dance music or crazy new rhythms.”</p>    <p>The newly electroclash-adjacent Princess Superstar had a Top 3 hit with Perfect (Exceeder), a collaboration with Dutch producer Mason, but it was the exception that proved the rule. For all the excitement and press coverage it generated, electroclash noticeably failed to produce a major crossover star, although it wasn’t for want of trying in some quarters. The Ministry of Sound’s record label famously spent vast sums signing New York duo Fischerspooner, but their debut album #1 failed to catch light. “Electroclash didn’t work in hygienic conditions,” offers Mark Wood, a DJ and Nag regular behind the new box set. “It worked in clubs that were dark, hot, grubby, full of smoke, all sorts of things going on.”</p> <p>Peaches, meanwhile, went out on tour as a support to hard rock artists, including Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age: their audiences, she says, were “horrified”. “I think a lot of [electroclash artists] were offered these more traditional tours and thought ‘I can’t handle it’. On the Marilyn Manson tour I was spat on every night, but I rapidly developed some prank skills and some great one-liners.”</p> <p>But in Britain at least, electroclash entered the mainstream regardless, audibly impacting on the way existing pop stars sounded. Sugababes rebooted their career with Freak Like Me, a Richard X-produced reimagining of the old Adina Howard hit backed by the music from Tubeway Army’s Are Friends Electric? Another Richard X mashup, Being Nobody, which melded Rufus and Chaka Khan’s Ain’t Nobody with the Human League’s Being Boiled, was a Top 3 hit for Popstars runners-up Liberty X. You could hear echoes of electroclash in Goldfrapp’s platinum-selling 2003 album Black Cherry, Rachel Stevens’ 2004 hit Some Girls and Madonna’s 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor. Even Fischerspooner ended up on Top of the Pops, in the company of Kylie Minogue, performing their remix of Come Into My World.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was girls, gays and theys – and the music industry didn’t invest in those categories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In America, however, the movement provoked a backlash. “It was unfairly beaten up after three or four years,” says Larry Tee. “Electroclash was girls, gays and theys, the music industry didn’t really invest in those three categories, and I think they were as anxious to kill it as they were disco. I think the reason they wanted to burn electroclash so fast is that it didn’t really include that soccer bro culture, which EDM did.”</p> <p>Nag Nag Nag eventually closed its doors in 2008 – the club that hosted it, Ghetto, was demolished to make way for the Crossrail development. It seemed symbolic of the end of something bigger than electroclash. “It was Soho’s last stand as a grubby nightclub place – that’s all literally gone, everything moved east,” says Wood. “It was around the same time that smartphones arrived, which changed everything too. All that happened around the same time electroclash was being put to bed. Nothing lasts for ever if it’s worth having in pop music.”</p> <p>But recently, Jonny Melton noticed something odd. He was being sent new dance tracks that self-described as electroclash, while club nights, including London’s Shackled By Lust and Bloghouse, also use the term to describe what’s on offer. “That would never have happened before,” he laughs. “At the time electroclash was like goth – no one who was in a goth a band would ever admit to being a goth band.”</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in 2023, Peaches embarked on a tour performing her debut album: it was both rapturously received and attracted an audience noticeably big on twentysomethings too young to remember its release. Princess Superstar, whose “career sort of died” in the 2010s, has watched with baffled delight as her electroclash-era hits unexpectedly enjoyed a new lease of life. First, Perfect (Exceeder) belatedly went gold in the US after it was used on the soundtrack of the 2023 movie Saltburn. Then, last year, her 2008 collaboration with Larry Tee, Licky, unexpectedly went viral on TikTok. “I think they thought it was by Britney Spears,” she says. “So I put a video up like, ‘Hey dudes’ and it all went crazy.”</p> <p>She’s currently making new music, some of it in collaboration with Frost Children, a US duo among a wave of younger artists who bear the influence of electroclash: you can hear its strains in Snow Strippers, Confidence Man and the Dare. Larry Tee, who’s currently planning an electroclash documentary, suggests there’s an influence in the music of both Lady Gaga and Charli xcx’s Brat.</p> <p>The music on When the 2000s Clashed still sounds remarkably fresh. Perhaps that fact that most of it remained underground, never dominating the singles chart or the radio playlists helped; so too does the fact that it’s informed by a lot of ideas that were subsequently mainstreamed: it was gender fluid before anyone talked about gender fluidity, sex-positive before anyone used that term either. “I think the younger generation get it,” nods Larry Tee, “because it was like the resistance: we’ve had enough of homophobia, enough of misogyny. For a moment, the door was open.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.demonmusicgroup.co.uk/catalogue/releases/when-the-2000s-clashed-machine-music-for-a-new-millennium-3lp/\">When the 2000s Clashed: Machine Music for a New Millennium</a> is out on 17 October on Demon/Edsel</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the dead of night over many months, a visitor entered our kitchen and wrote in the wee small hours over the doormat. What to read into its silvery doodles other than “I was here, here and here”? I&nbsp;never crept downstairs to interrupt and spoil its mystery; never saw it or worked out how it came and went.</p> <p>Every night it came without fail, until one parched day of the droughty summer. Over the previous few nights, the kitchen trails of our slug or snail had grown thin, thready and shorter. </p> <p>That evening, we walked over the&nbsp;lawn and the dead grass powdered underfoot. How could anything in need of moisture possibly survive? On the following morning and the ones after, there was nothing on the doormat. Stickiness needs sustenance, and it&nbsp;seemed this little gastropod’s life of slime was over.</p> <p>Now, with the return of rain, it’s back and laying trails. Not those feeble semicolon and comma dribbles of late, but the full spaghetti. Not dead as thought, but roused from aestivation, that improbable process by which slugs and snails all but shut down and sit out adverse conditions.</p> <p>And yet still I fret.

Is there dearth under darkness and what might be the wider ramifications?</p> <p>Outside the kitchen door, a morning downpour has brought forth a small battalion of banded snails. A shower is not enough to draw them from the lavender and on to the path; it takes a full soaking&nbsp;to flush them out, and each grazing mollusc appears to be drowning in its own meniscus. Except that they push on, riding through the waves over the concrete meadow, in colours and patterns many and various. Some with shells of cooking-apple green, others rose pink.

    "description": "<p>With his Sundance film festival and institute, Robert Redford used his considerable power to bring generations of talented film-makers to a bigger audience</p>",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-oscar-winning-actor-and-director-dies\">died at the age of 89</a> on Tuesday, will rightly be remembered as one of Hollywood’s finest leading men, a true-blue movie star and assured actor who was, to quote my mother and surely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">many others</a>, “very, very handsome”. His many iconic performances – in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Way We Were, The Sting and more – certainly left an indelible mark on American movies. But he should perhaps be remembered more for his work behind the camera, as the country’s greatest benefactor of independent cinema.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">Robert Redford: the incandescently handsome star who changed Hollywood forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through his Sundance film festival and non-profit institute, Redford lent his considerable star power and funds to American independent film, and created what is still its most secure and enduring pillar of support. He provided maverick, cutting-edge film-making with a freewheeling marketplace and crucial buzz, helping to launch the careers of a true who’s who of critically acclaimed directors across generations. With Sundance, Redford played the role of mentor, patron, champion of the small and scrappy, benevolent godfather of independent cinema. It’s through Sundance, rather than his films, that Redford became, as the Black List founder Franklin Leonard <a href=\"https://x.com/franklinleonard/status/1967954426414669848\">put it</a> on X, “arguably the film industry’s most consequential American over the last fifty years”.</p> <p>Redford founded the Sundance Institute, named after his character in the 1969 film, in 1981, as a means to support risk-taking voices outside the Hollywood studio system. The mission was loose, but grounded in the then 44-year-old actor’s real frustration with the movie business. “We started this with no rigid expectations,” Redford told the critic Roger Ebert at an early iteration of the film festival in 1981. “I have no idea what this will turn out to be. I know that it’s getting increasingly hard to get a movie well distributed in this country unless it has the potential to make millions of dollars.” As an alternative experiment, Redford invited 10 screenwriters to develop their low-budget scripts at a cabin in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, where the reclusive star had purchased land and made his home.</p>    <p>The tiny Sundance Institute grew into a small festival after Redford purchased the struggling Utah/US film festival in 1984. By 1989, when Steven Soderbergh’s Sex, Lies and Videotape premiered at what had become an annual January gathering in Park City, the Sundance film festival (as it was renamed in 1991) represented the creative vanguard. Some of the most influential and enduring films of the 1990s came out of the festival – Reservoir Dogs, Before Sunrise and The Blair Witch Project, as well as the documentaries Hoop Dreams and Paris Is Burning.</p> <p>The festival has built a reputation as a pipeline of diverse talent; top directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Richard Linklater, Chloé Zhao, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Nicole Holofcener, David O Russell, Darren Aronofsky, the Daniels and Celine Song have all been nurtured at some point in their early career by Sundance. In 2022, Coda, directed by Sian Heder with a $10m budget, became the first festival premiere to win the best picture Oscar. “Coda came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” its star Marlee Matlin posted on X. “And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford.”</p> <p>Alongside its renegade narrative features, the festival has also become the go-to destination for hot-button documentaries, particularly those grappling with tough, timely subjects. The <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/tv-documentaries-ethical-standards.html\">documentary streaming boom</a> arguably began at the festival in 2017, when Netflix purchased Icarus, a film on the Russian doping scandal that went on to win the Oscar – Netflix’s first – for a then staggering sum of $5m. For several years after, the festival was a hot marketplace for documentaries large and small. Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Brooke Shields and Michael J Fox debuted films about them in Utah; documentaries on such figures as Christopher Reeves, the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Hillary Clinton generated international headlines and commanded ever-larger sums. Though the market has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/01/documentaries-oscars\">cooled</a>, the festival remains an incubator for pressing documentaries – this year saw films on Florida’s stand-your-ground laws, abysmal Alabama prisons and US book bans in schools – as well as awards. Institute-supported documentaries have <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/sundance-institute-has-long-history-of-oscar-winning-documentaries/\">won a total of 20 Oscars</a>; all but one of last year’s best documentary nominees premiered at the festival.</p> <p>With mainstream acclaim come major celebrities, and with celebrities come crowds, sponsors and influencers. Starting in the 2010s, the festival has been as synonymous with celebrities in trendy winter wear, long lines and pop-up brand houses as independent film. After years of logistical issues – what once drew a few hundred cinephiles to the mountains now courts upwards of 85,000 visitors every January – the festival announced earlier this year that it would relocate in 2027 to Boulder, Colorado.</p>    <p>But the institute has remained true to Redford’s founding mission. According to Sundance, more than 11,000 early career artists have received support since its founding, in the form of grants, labs, intensive programs, mentorship and fellowships. I personally know film-makers and writers who have applied to the lab, considered the pinnacle of early-stage mentorship, an imprimatur of taste and trust. And since the establishment of its Native American and Indigenous program in 1994, the non-profit remains one of the pre-eminent supporters of Indigenous film talent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/sep/02/its-a-completely-new-day-the-rise-of-indigenous-films-and-tv-shows\">too-long ignored by institutional Hollywood</a>. The program’s grants, labs and community have helped launch the careers of Chris Eyre (whose film Smoke Signals premiered in 1998), Reservation Dogs’ Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi.</p> <p>In his later years, Redford often groused about the mainstreaming of the festival to which he devoted nearly half his life; “I want the ambush marketers – the vodka brands and the gift-bag people and the Paris Hiltons – to go away forever,” he told a reporter during the 2012 festival. It is true that the festival is not the iconoclastic upstart it once was, and that the festival produces a few imitative “Sundance movies” – spare, underwritten dramas with beautiful vistas and natural light – every year. But the impact of Sundance – in time, in space, in mentorship, money and community – is incalculable to the landscape of American cinema. Redford’s goal, as he said in his 2002 honorary Oscar speech, was to “make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive”. With 40 years of stewardship at Sundance, Robert Redford has done more than most to ensure that it will.</p>",

The man had been due to be on a flight to France at 9am on Wednesday.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, halted his removal after a decision came through during the court hearing that his claims to be a victim of trafficking required further investigation.</p> <p>The ruling is a significant blow to the government because many of those due to be removed under the scheme are potential victims of trafficking. Because they have only recently arrived in the UK they have not had an opportunity to have their trafficking claim fully investigated nor to obtain expert medical and psychological reports.</p> <p>The Home Office argued against halting the removal, saying that the man could get further evidence to support his trafficking claim from France. On Tuesday evening, Sheldon said he was “going to grant a short period of interim relief”.</p> <p>The judgment came after a decision from the national referral mechanism, which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking, and the invitation from the body for the man to make further representations.</p> <p>In his oral ruling, Sheldon said: “It seems there is a serious issue to be tried with respect of the trafficking claim and whether or not the secretary of state has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.</p> <p>“In my view there’s a serious case to be tried as to whether or not the removal decision is lawful. If there is a reasonable suspicion he has been trafficked that would amount to a statutory bar for removal, at least for a short period of time.”</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/no-10-denies-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-is-shambles\">Downing Street denied that the returns deal with France was in chaos</a> after plans to forcibly remove from the UK people arriving in small boats were abandoned on Monday and Tuesday. The prime minister’s spokesperson was forced to deny that the latest delay meant the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">agreement</a> was a “shambles” when asked by reporters.</p> <p>A government source said the first flight was expected to take off this week.</p> <p>Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, which is supporting detainees earmarked for removal to France, said: “We welcome the high court decision to halt this man’s flight so that details of his case can be considered. We are in contact with people detained for the one-in, one-out scheme, the vast majority of whom are torture and trafficking survivors.</p> <p>“The largest group is from Eritrea. Due to the nature of what they have experienced in the countries they have passed through, histories of modern slavery and sexual abuse are recurring.”</p> <p>Ministers agreed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">one-in, one-out pilot scheme</a> with the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat crossings so far this year.</p> <p>The first detentions of migrants took place last month as the deal came into force and they have been held at an immigration removal centre pending their removal from the country.</p> <p>Under the arrangement, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.</p> <p>Sonali Naik KC, representing the unnamed man, told the court on Tuesday he faced a “real risk of destitution” if he was put on a flight to France. She said there was a “serious issue to be tried” and that the man risked destitution in France, something the judge said he did not believe would be the case. The court heard evidence that about a third of asylum seekers in France were not accommodated and given a daily allowance of €7.50.</p> <p>Kate Grange KC, for the Home Office, said it was important for the agreement with France to go ahead because of the continuing risk to life of Channel crossings. “Serious injury and death, including of children, from small boat crossings in the English Channel is a grave social and political concern at the present time,” she said.</p> <p>The Tories said Labour’s returns deal with France was “another failed gimmick” after a scheduled deportation was blocked following a last-minute legal challenge.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a British national on suspicion of the murder of the Kenyan woman Agnes Wanjiru, who was found dead in the grounds of a hotel near an army base in 2012.</p> <p>The high court judge Alexander Muteti issued the arrest warrant earlier on Tuesday in Kenya, with the prosecution telling the court a suspect had been charged with murder, and his extradition to Kenya was being sought.</p> <p>UK-based witnesses will be called on to testify in a future trial, the prosecution said. “The witnesses are in United Kingdom but we will avail them,” the court heard.</p> <p>The office of the director of public prosecutions informed the court that the accused had been charged with the offence of murder.</p> <p>Wanjiru, 21, was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out in the Lion’s Court hotel in her home town of Nanyuki on 31 March 2012.</p> <p>She disappeared that night, with friends and family searching for her, until her body was found months later stuffed inside a septic tank at the hotel.</p> <p>Wanjiru, who worked as a hairdresser, and sometimes sold sex for extra money, had a daughter, Stacey, who was just five months old at the time that she disappeared.</p> <p>It is understood that Kenyan authorities will begin extradition proceedings, with the intention that the soldier will face charges in Kenya.</p> <p>“We have lived with the pain of Agnes’s death for over a decade,” her family said in a statement. “The reports that an arrest warrant has been issued against a UK citizen is a significant moment for us and is incredibly welcome.”</p> <p>Tessa Gregory, the family’s lawyer and a partner at Leigh Day, added: “The family now calls upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible.”</p> <p>If he is extradited, it is believed it will be the first time a current or former British soldier has ever been extradited to another country to face trial for the murder of a civilian.</p> <p>Wanjiru’s death has already been the focus of two inquests and several criminal inquiries.</p> <p>The bar of the Lion’s Court hotel was a popular destination for British soldiers, who were based at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) in Nanyuki, which is about 125 miles north of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>The inquest heard that Wanjiru had last been seen leaving the bar with one or more British soldiers.</p> <p>A suspect was named by several soldiers who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, after an investigation into the murder by the Sunday Times in 2021.</p> <p>Since the newspaper identified a suspected killer, it is understood that Kenyan detectives have flown to the UK several times to question soldiers and ex-soldiers who were in Nanyuki at the time of the murder.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the defence secretary, John Healey, met Wanjiru’s family in Kenya and promised the UK’s “full support” for the investigation.</p> <p>“It was deeply humbling to meet the family of Agnes Wanjiru today,” Healey said in April. “In the 13 years since her death, they have shown such strength in their long fight for justice. I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.”</p> <p>Previously, as shadow defence secretary, Healey had called on the then Conservative government to do more to resolve the case.</p> <p>“Agnes’s death has had a profound and devastating impact on our family,” her relatives previously said in a statement.</p> <p>“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death.”<br><br>“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a spokesperson for the UK government said.</p> <p>“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.</p> <p>“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”</p> <p>No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.<strong> </strong>The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The owner of the ceramics business Wedgwood has said it will freeze production at its factory in Staffordshire for 90 days in a move that will place 70 workers on temporary leave.</p> <p>The shutdown, which the firm’s owner, Fiskars Group, described as a short-term measure, will start on 29 September in response to weaker demand in some of its most important markets.</p> <p>It will also pause factory tours at its World of Wedgwood tourist attraction, with plans to restart them early next year.</p> <p>Wedgwood, which can trace its heritage to the 18th century, makes porcelain and luxury home accessories.</p> <p>It is headquartered in Barlaston near Stoke-on-Trent, where it employs 274 people. The company said it had many more people working globally for the business in markets such as China and Japan, where it has the majority of its stores.</p> <p>The pottery and ceramics sector has struggled in recent years under the pressure of rising costs and energy bills. A number of potteries have collapsed in Staffordshire, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/18/staffordshire-potteries-ceramics-companies-closures-royal-stafford\">the nearly 200-year-old Royal Stafford in February.</a></p> <p>A Wedgwood spokesperson said: “This short-term measure is being taken to address elevated inventory levels caused by lower consumer demand in some of our key markets.</p> <p>“Barlaston and its community are of key importance to Fiskars Group and Wedgwood.”</p> <p>The company said its artisans still used techniques pioneered by founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/01/wedgwood-collection-v-and-a-treasures\">Josiah Wedgwood, who was born in Staffordshire in 1730.</a></p> <p>“This living tradition reflects our commitment to craftsmanship, the value of Made in England and Barlaston’s enduring role in our heritage and operations,” a Fiskars spokesperson said.</p> <p>Fiskars, which employs 6,850 people across its group, also owns Royal Doulton and the Danish porcelain brand Royal Copenhagen, among others.</p> <p>The business, which is listed in Finland, reported net sales of €1.2bn (£1bn) in its 2024 financial year, up slightly from €1.1bn in the previous year. Its pre-tax profit, however, fell by 77% from €79.7m to €18.5m.</p> <p>The group lowered its profit guidance for the year in June, blaming the impact of US tariffs on retailer demand. The US accounts for about 30% of its overall sales.</p> <p>Wedgwood dates back to 1759, when Josiah Wedgwood started as an independent potter in Staffordshire. He invented new ceramic materials such as jasperware and black basalt, and was among the first makers to stamp his name on his product. He was the grandfather of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/16/great-dynasities-the-darwins\">Charles Darwin.</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Manufacturers say new rules on passing on assets threaten investment and future survival of businesses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p> <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p> <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p> <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p> <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p> <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p> <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p> <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p> <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p> <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>. </p> <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p> <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p> <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p> <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>    <p>A study by CBI Economics found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p> <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p> <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p> <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p> <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p> <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p> <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p> <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p> <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p> <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p> <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Jaguar Land Rover says cyber-attack has affected ‘some data’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p> <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p> <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p> <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p> <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p> <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p> <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p> <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The first three defendants in England and Wales charged with showing support for the banned group Palestine Action have pleaded not guilty to charges under the Terrorism Act.</p> <p>Jeremy Shippam, 72, of Yapton, West Sussex, Judit Murray, 71, of West Ewell, Surrey, and Fiona Maclean, 53, of Hackney, north-east London, will face trial in March next year for allegedly holding placards saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action”.</p> <p>Appearing at Westminster magistrates court in central London on Tuesday, the three all denied the same charge of displaying an article, namely a placard, in a public place, arousing reasonable suspicion that they are a supporter of a proscribed organisation, contrary to section 13 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>The defendants, who appeared before the chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, were allowed to sit outside the dock as two are hard of hearing and hearing loops could not be found for them.</p> <p>Since the ban on Palestine Action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">came into effect on 5 July</a>, 138 people in England and Wales have been charged with showing support for the group, out of more than 1,600 people arrested.</p> <p>The three in court on Tuesday were all arrested at a demonstration in Parliament Square, central London, on the day the ban took effect. They could face a maximum sentence of six months in jail and/or a fine if convicted. They were released in conditional bail until 16 March.</p> <p>A group of protesters gathered outside the court building shouting pro-Palestine slogans, waving flags and carrying placards.</p> <p>The next protest in Parliament Square opposing proscription is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/week-protests-palestine-action-ban-begin-labour-conference\">scheduled for 4 October</a>, ending a week of planned demonstrations beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Negotiations soon to begin on UK’s entry to Safe scheme, which it hopes will secure bigger role for its defence firms</p>",
    "content": "<p>France has proposed limiting the use of British-produced military components in the EU’s €150bn defence fund, in a move that could complicate negotiations over the UK’s entry into the scheme.</p> <p>Four diplomatic sources told the Guardian that French officials had proposed a 50% ceiling on the value of UK components in projects financed through the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) fund.</p> <p>The €150bn loans scheme is part of the EU’s drive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine\">to boost defence spending by €800bn and re-arm the continent</a>. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, lauded the scheme on Tuesday, telling an audience of policymakers in Brussels that the commission had assigned loans to member states in less than six months since the idea was first mooted – “the sense of urgency we need”.</p> <p>The door to greater UK participation was pushed open in May when Keir Starmer and von der Leyen signed an <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eu-uk-security-and-defence-partnership_en\">EU-UK security and defence partnership</a>. Without this pact, the UK could never supply more than 35% of the value of components of any Safe-funded project.</p> <p>Yet the UK still needs to negotiate a technical agreement to secure a bigger role for its defence firms, and the EU could impose limits on British participation. The British government also needs to negotiate a fee to join the scheme.</p> <p>The limits on British inputs were suggested during internal meetings as EU member states prepare a negotiating mandate for the European Commission before talks with Keir Starmer’s government.</p> <p>The UK and commission will negotiate the cost and terms of British entry into Safe in the coming weeks, but first the EU needs unanimity on its position.</p> <p>A large majority of member states oppose restrictions on UK participation, as they want flexibility over defence procurement. One EU diplomat described the proposed 50% limit as “the classic French obsession”.</p> <p>France has long championed the idea of a European defence industry autonomous from the US: it has also argued that since Brexit, Britain can no longer reap the benefits of the EU’s single market.</p> <p>The UK does not intend to apply for loans, which are earmarked for EU member states, but hopes British defence companies will benefit from the spending bonanza. A formal agreement to enter Safe would make it easier for British firms to be part of defence supply chains to provide kit, ranging from small drones, ammunition and infantry weapons to artillery systems with deep precision strike capabilities.</p> <p>A spokesperson at the French permanent representation in Brussels said: “We support the European commission in its efforts to establish the parameters for the UK’s association with Safe. The basis for this is provided by the Safe regulation, which stipulates among other principles that some of the components must come from the EU’s industry.”</p> <p>The UK also needs to negotiate the fee for joining the scheme, intended to cover administrative costs. The EU’s most senior diplomats are due on Wednesday to discuss British entry to Safe, as well as a parallel text for Canada, which also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/canada-eu-defense-trump-us-allies\">recently signed a defence and security pact with the bloc</a>.</p> <p>The European Commission’s spokesperson on defence, Thomas Regnier, said: “The UK is an essential partner and ally for the EU, with whom the president has signed a security and defence partnership in May. They have a very advanced defence industry, we share many common interests, hence our will to sign a win-win agreement to fully associate them to our Safe instrument.”</p> <p>The commission announced that last week 19 EU countries would take out Safe loans. Poland is taking out the largest loan, of €43.7bn, almost one third of the total. France and Hungary will borrow €16.2bn each, Romania €16.7bn and Italy €14.9bn. The EU-backed loans lower the cost of borrowing for many member states and can be spent on supplying national armies or aiding Ukraine.</p>",

Back home, his father flicks through TV channels while his mother counts bags of flour. No one speaks. The silence is broken only by crackles on the radio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9/0_0_1968_2912/676.jpg\" alt=\"A magazine cover with graphic novel-like drawings of an African boy, a line of people queueing for water, the boy running away from two others, someone lying in bed and a city street    \" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma is published in The Continent, a pan-African e-paper </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Edizon Musavuli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By evening, Baraka is sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, looking south to Bukavu and east towards Rwanda, finding no hope in either direction.</p> <p>This is the opening to Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, the first comic by a 31-year-old visual artist, Edizon Musavuli, published earlier this year in the Continent, a weekly pan-African newspaper. The story depicts everyday struggles in Goma through the eyes of a child.</p> <p>Prominent Congolese artists such as Barly Baruti, Fifi Mukuna and Papa Mfumu’Eto, who captured the public’s imagination in comic strips in the past, mainly worked abroad or in Kinshasa, a city more than a thousand miles from Goma. But there are few contemporary comics set in or about the Democratic Republic of the Congo written by Congolese artists.</p>    <p>“I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil,” Musavuli says of his journey as an artist. He began to pursue the craft seriously only after finishing high school, enrolling at the Africa Digital Media Institute in Nairobi. His studies, however, were cut short by financial difficulties.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Art gives hope. It’s something to start with </p> <footer> <cite>Edizon Musavuli</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His first solo exhibition was in January 2020, organised with the French Institute of Goma. “It was a really big exhibition. [And] it was impressive how everyone responded to it,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>But just a year later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/21/children-executed-and-women-raped-in-front-of-their-families-as-m23-militia-unleashes-fresh-terror-on-drc\">brutal M23 militia, backed by Rwanda</a>, resurfaced in eastern DRC and upended Goma’s fragile art scene.</p> <p>“Artists in Goma are really reliant on French exhibitions like that,” he says. “If they’re not around, it will feel like we don’t exist. That’s what’s happening right now.”</p>    <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/m23-rebel-group-goma-drc-democratic-republic-congo-rwanda\">M23 captured Goma</a> in January this year, the city’s creative spaces faltered alongside its economy. “Art gives hope. It’s something to start with, but our situation here doesn’t change. So people [in Goma] are not really interested any more,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>Artists and creativity have long been consigned to the margins of the state agenda. “We are not really something the government prioritises,” he says.</p>    <p>Turning to Instagram, he began sharing personal and collective experiences of Congolese life in the form of cartoons. In one post, recounting his childhood, he captioned an interactive story: “I’m from where you learn to run before you walk.”</p> <p>In one reel, which has since generated more than 10,000 views, he is seen working on an unfinished painting, while gunshots are heard in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A short video of graphic art illustrating the history of the Congo  \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

The story is charged with political undertones, highlighting how ordinary routines have been stripped away and replaced with constant uncertainty.</p> <p>Yet Musavuli insists the short comic was not meant as explicit political commentary: “I’m not really a political artist or activist [but] I say what people around me are thinking. That’s how I do my art.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We might not have power but not doing anything is so much worse.

    "description": "<p>Music Box Theatre, New York</p><p>Post-late-night, the star makes an exceptional return to the stage in this moderately entertaining comedy of male friendship</p>",
    "content": "<p>By now, September 2025, a certain formula has solidified on Broadway: stage a familiar-ish play, cast well-known film and TV actors, set a limited run and tickets will hopefully sell, or at least command high prices. It’s a commercially strong bet – while most Broadway musicals are failing financially, six plays have already become profitable: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/11/oh-mary-review-cole-escola-broadway\">Oh, Mary!</a> (starring Cole Escola), All In: Comedy About Love (John Mulaney, Jimmy Fallon, et al) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/24/romeo-juliet-broadway-review\">Romeo + Juliet</a> (Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/mar/24/othello-review-denzel-washington-jake-gyllenhaal\">Othello</a> (Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/01/glengarry-glen-ross-broadway-review\">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> (Bob Odenkirk, Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/03/good-night-good-luck-review-george-clooney\">Good Night, and Good Luck</a> (George Clooney).</p> <p>It’s led to some grousing – about ticket prices, about a Hollywood invasion, about the spirit of Broadway. I’m generally agnostic on this – Broadway has always run on star wattage, and screen actors certainly provide some – but it does change how audiences interact with the material. People enter the theater with preconceived notions, certain expectations or, in the case of John Krasinski’s solo show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jun/12/angry-alan-review-john-krasinski#:~:text=It's%20a%20fascinating%20use%20of,straight%20men's%20feelings%20as%20prey.\">Angry Alan,</a> the specter of one very beloved sitcom character. Actors and directors can work with it, subvert it, challenge it, submit to it, but the celebrity factor won’t disappear. There’s no such thing as a blank canvas.</p> <p>Tell that to Marc (Bobby Cannavale), a middle-aged man deeply troubled by his friend’s purchase of an all-white painting in Art, the latest limited-run, starry revival to open on Broadway. Serge (Neil Patrick Harris) sees lines, shadows, depth within the 4ft x 5ft canvas. Marc stares very hard, tries different angles – Cannavale, a two-time Tony nominee, wrings laughs out of this silent effort – but sees nothing but offensive folly in his friend’s $300,000 purchase. Their mutual friend Yvan (James Corden), less professionally successful but more open-hearted, sees whatever is needed to keep his friends agreeable.</p> <p>Yasmina Reza’s French-language play, first staged in Paris in 1994, then Broadway in 1998, is a study of male friendship. Which means that these three longtime friends – 25 years of friendship, we’re told – spend an inordinate amount of time talking about a painting that, at least to a viewer at the Music Box Theatre, appears as a large white rectangle. (Harris’s plaintive Serge, speaking directly to the audience, insists: it is not white!) This would grate – it skirts the edge of wearisome – if not for three solid performances and the timeless insight of Reza’s script, translated here by Christopher Hampton, into men’s coded language of feeling.</p> <p>Indirectness, of course, knows no sex or gender. But part of the magic of Reza’s play, staged here by Scott Ellis (most recently the director of Doubt), is the seamless demonstration of the lengths men will go to avoid speaking emotions plainly, the delicacy with which she writes specifically, identifiably male versions of passive aggression and avoidance. In a tight and uninterrupted 90 minutes set in one apartment – Ellis keeps the setting somewhere in Paris, though David Rockwell’s set evokes antiseptic luxury Brooklyn high-rise – the three actors capably ride a friendship devolution through some moderately entertaining shouting matches and quieter, cutting confessions.</p> <p>Harris and Cannavale make light work of these two politely adversarial aesthetes – the former crisp and tightly wound, the latter swaggering and easily wounded, both a little detestable. But it’s Corden, returning to Broadway for the first time since winning a Tony in 2012 for One Man, Two Guvnors), who steals the show, in a bit of stage image rehab post-Carpool Karaoke and, for the chronically online, Balthazar ban. As both the heart and the court jester for the show, Corden is superb, a perfectly calibrated level of hysterical, sincere and crisp. One blistering monologue sees him ranting, in the voice of three separate characters, for several minutes straight without missing a beat; it was not celebrity compelling the extended applause when he finally collapsed, spent and spittle-covered, into a chair.</p> <p>You can only talk art for so long. All three characters eventually crack open, though not, perhaps, to the degree one would hope, as Serge and Marc still rely on abstractions of taste, influence, ideas. It’s when Yvan crumbles, tearfully admitting the significance of these friends in this life, that the production unlocks some prismatic, elusive sentiment, a color noticeably missing from the canvas. Or maybe that’s just my reading, colored by many a frustrating attempt to pull emotions out of a man. Ultimately with any play, just as painting, you supply your own background and see what you see.</p>",

The argument that mastering AI is a life skill that students need in preparation for the labour market is unconvincing. Our experience is that generative AI undermines teaching and learning, bypasses reflection and criticality, and deflects students from reading&nbsp;original material.</p> <p>Student misuse of generative AI is widespread. Claims that AI helps preparation or research is simply cover for students taking shortcuts that do not develop their learning skills. Assessments are widely channelled through ChatGPT, disregarding universities’ usually feeble guidance and rules. Generative AI results in generic, dull and often factually incorrect output. </p> <p>For example, we asked students to interpret a short article by Henry Ford from 1922. Many answers suggested that the autocratic and racist Ford was developing a “sophisticated HR performance management function for his business” and that he was a “transformational leader”. </p> <p>In many degree programmes, LLMs have little to no practical value.

    "description": "<p>Readers respond to Jonathan Liew’s article about the effects of the toxic debate on immigration and the rise of the far right</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jonathan Liew’s article is a reminder that the immigration debate is never only about policy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/immigration-debate-country-remigration-right\">What is the endgame in this toxic immigration debate: is it friends and neighbours thrown out of the country?, 10 September</a>). It is about the value placed on human lives. He shows how language presented as reasonable or pragmatic often conceals darker intentions. What once felt impossible can be normalised step by step, until the unthinkable is treated as common&nbsp;sense.</p> <p>The strength of his piece lies in how it makes the issue personal. By asking us to picture the knock at the door, the packed bags by the hallway, or the quiet hostility from a stranger on a bus, he shows that this is not about statistics but about neighbours, colleagues and friends being treated as outsiders.</p> <p>This is not unique to Britain. Far-right parties across Europe are pushing “remigration” into the political mainstream, and Britain is not immune. The danger is that a hostile environment rarely stops at the margins. It spreads into daily life, encouraging cruelty and suspicion, making racial abuse easier to excuse and prejudice easier to voice. Even if mass deportations never take place on the scale some imagine, the harm is already being felt.</p> <p>The question Liew poses is simple: if this direction continues, what kind of country will we become and who will have the courage to say “enough” before it is too late.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• Thank you, Jonathan Liew, for speaking with such clarity for me as the son of Caribbean immigrants who came to this country as British citizens at the invitation of the British government in 1962. I was born here, have a UK passport, and have contributed to British society. This is my home. But I am scared that a Nigel Farage-led government would want to enact large-scale repatriation of people like me.</p> <p>For people of colour, this isn’t an exaggeration – it is based on fact. The UK has had a growing tolerance of racism and xenophobia, but this is the recooked racism of Enoch Powell and the National Front of the last century – and it’s getting nasty. The time to be sitting in complicit silence is over. <br><strong>Cllr Mark Blake</strong><br><em>Green party, Haringey, London</em></p> <p>• I found Jonathan Liew’s article sad and troubling. My father was Polish and, growing up in the 1950s and 60s in the UK, I was sometimes worried that I had a foreign name. But nothing was said or implied, and being white meant I was not an immediate target for racists. And then we became, I thought, a more tolerant society, with racism called out and reduced to a tiny minority of bigots. But in 2016 came Brexit, leading to the shameful return of the open racism we see today.</p> <p>Old fears are being renewed, and our spineless leaders seem incapable of standing up against this putrid tide. My only hope is that the majority of people, who are not racist, can bring strong influence to bear on our representatives at all levels, and let our own voices be heard. This must stop.<br><strong>Maria Koval</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• I am white, living in Lincolnshire and married to a first-generation Indian immigrant. In this part of the world, not only has Reform UK captured the hearts and minds of many neighbours, but you can see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/23/members-of-far-right-party-organising-asylum-hotel-protests-across-uk-facebook-posts-show\">Homeland party</a>, with its policy of remigration, gaining strength. Jonathan Liew’s piece so clearly brought home the rising terror that I now feel for my family, and the need to push back more forcefully against support for these policies.<br><strong>Patrick Horton</strong><br><em>Stamford, Lincolnshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p>Kirk’s rise to fame was largely bolstered by being extremely online – and it seems the suspect has that in common</p>",
    "content": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who promises he’ll come back from vacation. Meanwhile, I’m looking at the memes, gaming and internet culture behind the shooting of Charlie Kirk.</p> <p>The bullet that killed conservative activist was inscribed with a message: “Notices bulge OwO whats this?” The online world quickly recognized the reference. It’s a phrase used in internet culture to troll people in online role-play communities, specifically furries (a subculture that cosplays as anthropomorphic animal characters).</p> <p>“The phrase has been popularized not only as a way of making fun of furries and related communities for being cringe, but has also been embraced by furries as a way of owning the meme,” writes <a href=\"https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-the-notices-bulge-owo-whats-this-meme-the-phrase-inscribed-on-the-casing-of-the-bullet-fired-at-charlie-kirk-explained\">Know Your Meme</a>, a website that documents viral phenomena. “Ultimately, the phrase is portrayed in memes as being one of the most cringeworthy things someone could possibly write to another person.”</p> <p>Other bullet casings recovered by law enforcement in Utah also had etched inscriptions that appeared to nod to online gaming and insider memes, which have become part of the intense social media speculation on a possible motive for the killing. One said: “O Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao”, another said: “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO.” The first message refers to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/11/bella-ciao-resistance-anthem-history-meps-strasbourg-viktor-orban\">Italian anti-fascist folk song</a> that has become a gamer reference that’s big in Twitch and Discord circles. The second message is what web culture writer Ryan Broderick calls “just boilerplate edgelord speak” in his <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme&amp;_bhlid=c1bd8655d3ca168eb692fc88c054fa5a4ec0f5e9\">newsletter last week</a> titled “Charlie Kirk was killed by a meme”.</p> <p>The final inscribed casing that law enforcement released said: “Hey fascist! Catch!” and was followed by an up arrow, right arrow and three down arrow symbols. The arrow sequence appears to reference the video game Helldivers 2, and is a set of commands used by players to<a href=\"https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb\"> release a 500kg bomb</a> in the game.</p> <p>The alleged shooter, Tyler James Robinson, is a 22-year-old from a small town in Utah near the Arizona border. He is accused of killing Kirk at a campus event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired with a “high-powered bolt action rifle” from a distant rooftop.</p> <p>As the suspect was steeped in online culture, so was Charlie Kirk, who was 31. He was at the school on behalf of his conservative youth organization, Turning Point USA. He’d become known worldwide speaking about and debating others, often on his extremist views on race, immigration, gender identity and gun rights. Kirk’s rise to fame was also largely bolstered by being extremely online.</p> <p>As my colleague <em><strong>Alaina Demopoulos</strong></em> wrote:</p> <p><em>A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.</em></p> <p><em>Kirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn’t agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events.

And another by Meta’s former head of security for WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, who alleges the company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/technology/whatsapp-whistleblower-lawsuit.html\">brushed aside major security and privacy flaws</a> in its messaging app, according to the New York Times.</p> <p>In response to my reporting about VR devices, Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing. “These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.</p> <p>One of the first whistleblowers was Sophie Zhang, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang\">brought her findings to the Guardian</a> in 2021. Zhang documented how Facebook allowed political manipulation in more than 25 countries, which led to disastrous circumstances in several places including Myanmar, Azerbaijan and Honduras. Later that same year, Frances Haugen <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiYvVVTuGq2qxCs5kdvOyFVY1Z4AXuXEKPenRX384QOyEkDtDbmmiXcX5FMilM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c4ba92&amp;gaa_sig=Yg19r_tYezZtPdSGgXPGIREbdOvG08JTmaTHaY_m_mA7GAyPbjbtS7D-lpX_9UcukuydsL4laFso7zj_yjB9iQ%3D%3D\">turned over to the Wall Street Journal</a> reams of documentation verifying much of Zhang’s allegations and also bringing to light Facebook’s knowledge of how its social media apps harmed teens.</p> <p>In 2023, Arturo Bejar also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/instagram-facebook-teens-harassment-safety-5d991be1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiXGIQSY3aTBMnlSqMe1XIoujWyaSUlTONbyijuYASrehQ0UAsFa3p-iu_Z2QA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c4bb10&amp;gaa_sig=783wMI0ACofnXrmDHT6ZNwmGbOIG3v_2mO0H8adsx41yApSFzhWSnX3DF3eNjCNF1JgEh9asdDsf7xc0y-FGwA%3D%3D\">went to the Wall Street Journal</a> with evidence that Meta knew its algorithms for Facebook and Instagram were pushing content to teens that promoted bullying, drug abuse, eating disorders<strong> </strong>and self-harm.</p> <p>This year alone, eight more whistleblowers have come forward. Baig and the group of six former and current employees went public last week.</p> <p>US lawmakers are taking the allegations seriously. Politicians as disparate as Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, the democrat from Connecticut, have said they see eye-to-eye when it comes to regulating Meta and other social media companies.</p> <p>“The details in these disclosures are hard to stomach – because they reveal such major risks to kids’ safety, and because they are so painfully familiar. Yet again, Meta is revealed to be willfully misrepresenting abuses on its platforms,” Blumenthal said of the whistleblower claims last week. “‘Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil’ is simply not an acceptable business philosophy.”</p> <p>Blumenthal added that he and other senators were looking forward to pushing ahead with “long overdue reform”.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/google-gemini-ai-training-humans\">How thousands of ‘overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI to seem smart</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/who-is-larry-ellison-richest-person-oracle\">Larry Ellison: Oracle co-founder who overtook Musk as world’s richest person</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/apple-iphone-17\">Apple debuts thinner, $999 iPhone Air at ‘awe-dropping’ annual product event</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/how-to-save-the-internet-by-nick-clegg-review-spinning-silicon-valley\">How to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg review – spinning Silicon Valley</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’</a></p></li> </ul>",

Other production facilities around the world have also been affected, fuelling speculation that it could be weeks until systems are operational.</p> <p>The freeze has also affected suppliers and retailers for JLR, with some operating without computer systems and databases normally used for sourcing spare parts for garages or registering vehicles.</p> <p>Last week, the Unite union warned that thousands of workers in the JLR supply chain were at risk of losing their livelihoods, and urged the government to step in with a furlough scheme to support them.</p> <p>Disruption from the cyber-attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/07/disruption-to-jaguar-land-rover-after-cyber-attack-may-last-until-october\">could last until October</a>.

The carmaker reported that underlying pre-tax profits dropped 49% to £351m in the three months to June. That included a period when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/05/jaguar-land-rover-us-shipments-trumps-tariffs\">company temporarily paused exports to the US</a>.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/02/images-of-new-electric-jaguar-car-leak-out-before-official-miami-unveiling\"> company also faced criticism last year over its rebrand of Jaguar</a>, and its new electric cars are not expected to launch until next year.</p> <p>Chris McDonald, a minister at the business department, said on Tuesday: “We know this is a worrying time for those affected by this incident and our cyber experts are supporting JLR to help them resolve this issue as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“I met the company today to discuss their plans to resolve this issue and get production started again, and we continue to discuss the impact on the supply chain.” </p>",

    "description": "<p>FAA ruled to have satisfied obligations in granting approval for expanded SpaceX operations next to wildlife refuge</p>",
    "content": "<p>A US district court judge on Monday rejected a suit by conservation groups challenging the Federal Aviation Administration approval in 2022 of expanded rocket launch operations by Elon Musk’s SpaceX next to a national wildlife refuge in south Texas.</p> <p>The groups said noise, light pollution, construction and road traffic also degrade the area, home to endangered ocelots and jaguarundis, as well as nesting sites for endangered Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles and for threatened shorebirds.</p> <p>US district judge Carl Nichols in Washington said the FAA had satisfied its obligation “to take a hard look at the effects of light on nearby wildlife”.</p> <p>Donald Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\">executive order</a> on 13 August – titled Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry – that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-order-rocket-launches-musk-bezos\">relax environmental rules</a> for commercial spaceship companies, apparently benefitting Elon Musk. The companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).</p> <p>Private space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the FAA. And, as part of that process, companies are subject to review under Nepa.</p> <p>These environmental reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be enormously disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings. Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks and falling objects.</p> <p>Trump said it was imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase launches “substantially” by 2030.</p> <p>SpaceX has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/hawaii-elon-musk-spacex-rocket-debris\">seeking to increase its rocket launches</a> and landings around the country even as it has been embroiled in the lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. The groups say the FAA did not do a thorough enough environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas.</p> <p>The lawsuit looked at the first launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket in Texas in April 2023. The rocket, which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying six miles (10km) away. The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 1.5 hectares (4 acres) of state park and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs.</p> <p>The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25. SpaceX has also been seeking to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-09/spacex-hopes-to-nearly-double-the-rocket-launches-off-the-california-coast-a-state-panel-likely-to-object\">increase launches</a> of its smaller Falcon rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.</p> <p><em>Dara Kerr contributed reporting</em></p>",

The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p> <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p> <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p> <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 September 2025.

Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p> <p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrissey </strong>adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rachel Vahey, </strong>head of public policy at <strong>AJ Bell, </strong>points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p> <p><strong>Vahey </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p> <p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p> </blockquote> <p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary <strong>Liz</strong> <strong>Kendall</strong> said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/21/britain-is-facing-a-tsunami-of-pensioner-poverty-says-kendall\">Britain is facing a ‘tsunami’ of pensioner poverty, says Kendall</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:28:15.564Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c90a1e8f084793c7c162af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:07:01.551Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK jobs data: political reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The UK’s new Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has spotted some bright spots in today’s labour market reports.</strong></p> <p>He points to a drop in the economic inactivity rate (people neither in work nor looking for a job), which dipped by 0.02 percentage points over the last quarter to 21.1%.</p> <p><strong>McFadden </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Today’s figures show signs of progress with economic inactivity and redundancies continuing to fall.</p> <p>“But we must futureproof our workforce by giving people the opportunities and skills they need to secure the jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>“It is vital that our £240 million Get Britain Working plan is felt by people across the country, whether it’s through targeted support for young people entering the workforce, or joining up work, health and skills support.</p> <p>“The true strength of the UK’s economy lies in the British people, which is why we are unlocking opportunity in every part of the country to drive forward economic growth under our plan for change.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Daisy</strong> <strong>Cooper</strong>, the <strong>Liberal</strong> <strong>Democrat</strong> Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. </p> <p><strong>Cooper</strong> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c904a68f084793c7c16289\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T06:47:12.509Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JLR production pause extended until Wednesday 24 September</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jaguar Land Rover has extended the shutdown of its car production for another week, as it continues to reel from a disruptive cyber attack.</strong></p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> says it told its staff, suppliers and partners today that it has extended the current pause in our production until Wednesday 24 September.</p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p> <p>We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company’s factory lines have already been frozen for two weeks, since JLR’s manufacturing and retailing activities were “severely disrupted” by a cyber incident.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Last week, JLR revealed the hack had affected ‘some’ of its data</a>.</p> <p>The disruption is hurting the company’s suppliers;

So for us to be on 12 points now is so much more than I expected, especially when we had so many changes in the squad. I think we can do better but not every time we are going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/25/newcastle-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">face Newcastle away</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal at home</a>.”</p> <p>Slot has included Alexander Isak in the squad for the first time after leaving him out for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">victory over Burnley on Sunday</a>. The striker was not deemed able to play twice in a week after missing pre-season and the head coach wanted him available for the start of the European campaign.</p> <p>“It is 100% sure he will not play 90 minutes, but he is part of the squad,” Slot said. “So it is already a Champions League game to look forward to but if people look forward to his playing time that could mean that could happen tomorrow as well.”</p> <p>Virgil van Dijk has played against Isak numerous times and talked up the Swede’s ability on Tuesday. “He’s a clinical finisher. I think if you look at his finishing skills, heading left, right, top corners, he’s the complete striker at the moment and same you can say from Hugo [Ekitiké]. Very good, very eager, obviously the quality he’s been showing already since, I think, the first session.”</p> <p>Van Dijk said he had spoken to Isak during the international break. “For him it’s obviously about getting as fit as possible, as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, how we do set pieces. So it’s been a good week for him and let’s see tomorrow.”</p> <p>Liverpool have ambitions to challenge for the Champions League after being knocked out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/11/liverpool-psg-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">Paris Saint-Germain on penalties</a> in the last 16 last season. Atlético’s visit is the start of a difficult-looking league stage for Slot’s side, who then travel to Galatasaray and will also face Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, PSV and Inter before Christmas.</p> <p>“I’m confident that we can show Europe that we are a fantastic team, but you have to work for it,” Van Dijk said. “It’s all about the work that you put in, obviously on the pitch but off the pitch as well, in order to be at your best.”</p>",

<strong>Marco Rubio</strong> said as he headed to Qatar on Tuesday that he would ask it to stay on as a mediator in Israel’s war on Gaza, a week after Israeli airstrikes against Hamas leaders in Doha.</p> \n  <p>Rubio expressed pessimism about a ceasefire deal as he flew out from Tel Aviv amid the IDF’s intensified bombardment of Gaza but told reporters that Qatar uniquely could help, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> \n  <p>“We’re going to ask Qatar to continue to do what they’ve done, and we appreciate very much, and that is, play a constructive role in trying to bring this to an end,” Rubio told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.</p> \n  <p>“Obviously they have to decide if they want to do that after last week or not, but we want them to know that if there’s any country in the world that could help end this through a negotiation, it’s Qatar.”</p> \n  <p>Rubio said the US would work with Qatar to finalise a defence agreement soon despite the Israeli military action last week.</p> \n  <p>“If any country in the world can help mediate it, Qatar is the one. They’re the ones that can do it,” Rubio said while departing Tel Aviv for Doha.</p> \n  <p>“We have a close partnership with the Qataris. In fact, we have an enhanced defence cooperation agreement, which we’ve been working on, we’re on the verge of finalising,” Rubio said, without elaborating.</p> \n  <p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> told reporters in Washington that prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> “won’t be hitting” Qatar again.</p> \n  <p>Rubio made no such comments in <strong>Israel</strong>.

It was the first time a president has pursued such action since the central bank’s founding in 1913.

    "content": "<p>Robert Redford, who has died aged 89, was the golden boy of American cinema for more than 50 years. </p> <p>In one respect, with his blond good looks, he conformed to a mythic Californian stereotype, or what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman\">Dustin Hoffman</a> called a “walking surfboard”. However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a>, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p>    <p>Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of an accountant with Standard Oil, and his wife, Martha (nee Hart). The family moved to Van Nuys, California, where Robert went to Van Nuys high school. He was blessed early on with a graceful athleticism, excelling in swimming, tennis, football and baseball, the last of which won him a scholarship to the University of Colorado, where he could also indulge his love for climbing and skiing.</p> <p>But he soon became frustrated by what he called “test-tube athletes”. As the character of the Olympic skier that he played in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdd7W_h3VK4\">Downhill Racer</a> (1969) says: ‘“I never knew what it was like to just enjoy a sport. I was always out there grovelling to win. You begin to fear not winning.”</p> <p>When his lack of attendance at baseball practice led to him losing his scholarship, he left for Europe in 1957. Because he had displayed a certain talent as a caricaturist in high school, he did what all hopeful American artists did: he went to paint in Paris before being forced into the realisation that, as an artist, he was mediocre. On his return to the US, he married his girlfriend, Lola Van Wagenen, in 1958 and studied scenic design at the Pratt Institute in New York.</p> <p>When Redford was told that to really understand the principles of scenic design, he must put himself in the actor’s place, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. “At the Academy I got the space and the opportunity to expand and form myself as an actor, but I didn’t learn to act,” he recalled.</p> <p>None the less, in 1959, he made his professional stage debut on Broadway with a small role as a basketball player in Tall Story, which he repeated uncredited in the feature film version starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\">Jane Fonda</a> the following year. During the try-out run for The Highest Tree (1959), a short-lived play about a nuclear scientist, his first child, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome.</p> <p>He made it big on Broadway in Norman Krasna’s Sunday in New York (1961) and even bigger in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/neil-simon-obituary\">Neil Simon</a>’s hit comedy Barefoot in the Park (1963), which he reprised in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY-uQehpXf0\">screen version</a> opposite Fonda in 1967. He remained in the play for the first year of its four-year run, but never worked in the theatre again.</p> <p>At the same time, he was racking up numerous TV credits, including the callow Don Parritt in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sidney-lumet\">Sidney Lumet</a>’s production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eugene-o-neill\">Eugene O’Neill</a>’s The Iceman Cometh (1960) and a memorable appearance as the Angel of Death in an exceptional 1962 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/18/twilight-zone-your-next-boxset\">Twilight Zone</a> episode called Nothing in the Dark.</p>    <p>Redford’s first credited film role was in the untrumpeted War Hunt (1962), an off-beat little picture, shot in 15 days, in which Pollack also made his screen debut as a performer. They played members of a platoon in Korea, one of whom (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/jul/26/nightmare-on-elm-streets-john-saxon-a-life-in-pictures\">John Saxon</a>) is schizophrenic. He goes out on lone missions and kills the enemy with a stiletto. Redford’s character tries to rescue an orphan from Saxon’s influence.</p> <p>It was three years before he returned to the big screen, gaining some attention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/23/obituary-robert-mulligan\">Robert Mulligan’s</a> Inside Daisy Clover (1965), in which he played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/20/biography.film\">Natalie Wood</a>’s egotistical, bisexual matinee idol husband and for which he won the Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer.</p> <p>This promise was fulfilled in his following films, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/29/arthur-penn-obituary\">Arthur Penn</a>’s steamy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EbbnP9dBmk\">The Chase</a> (1966), in which Redford played an escaped convict whom the fair-minded sheriff (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Marlon Brando</a>) tries to protect from being lynched by the inhabitants of a small Texas town. Although the role required Redford to spend much of the film running through rice fields, he opted for that rather than playing the sheriff, the part he was offered originally.</p> <p>He seemed incredibly relaxed and confident in the early stages of his career, rejecting two roles offered to him by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a> – the younger man in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (eventually played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/24/george-segal-obituary\">George Segal</a>), and Benjamin Braddock in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-graduate-review-anne-bancroft-dustin-hoffman\">The Graduate</a>, because he felt too old for the part, even though he and Hoffman, who made his name from the part, were almost the same age. He also turned down the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johncassavetes\">John Cassavetes</a> role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski\">Roman Polanski</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rosemary-s-baby\">Rosemary’s Baby</a>.</p> <p>Instead, he preferred to co-star with Wood again in Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JX84nAZDX4\">This Property Is Condemned</a> (1966), based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a> play, as a mysterious railway official. Next came Barefoot in the Park, and then one of his best-known roles, Sundance <strong>–</strong> a role passed over by Brando, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/warren-beatty\">Warren Beatty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> – opposite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/27/paulnewman.usa1\">Paul Newman</a>’s Butch Cassidy in one of the most successful westerns ever.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/30/guardianobituaries.film\">George Roy Hill</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> (1969) created at its core an irresistible chemistry between its two male leads as charming outlaws, leading to a string of buddy movies, including the equally successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/22/the-sting-best-picture-oscar-1974\">The Sting</a> (1973) with the same director and stars, this time playing scam artists in 1930s Chicago.</p> <p>Between the two hit movies, Redford made several films, the best being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/19/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Michael Ritchie</a>’s satirical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/26/how-hollywood-predicted-the-year-of-the-accidental-politician\">The Candidate</a> (1972), about a presidential campaign, in which he was well cast in the vapid title role, and Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=292Oouog8fI\">The Way We Were</a> (1973). The latter, an odd couple romantic comedy with Redford as an upper-crust Wasp who does not take politics seriously, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbra-streisand\">Barbra Streisand</a> as a working-class Jewish leftist uncompromising in her political beliefs, saw them both performing well within their comfort zones.</p> <p>By the end of the 60s, Redford had become one of the world’s top film stars and box-office attractions, with carefully chosen projects to keep alive his screen persona in glossy Hollywood star vehicles. Among the exceptions were movies that satisfied his liberal leanings, especially <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-alan-pakula-1186240.html\">Alan Pakula</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\">Watergate</a> exposé, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/10/all-the-presidents-men-watergate-conspiracy-richard-nixon-woodward-bernstein-redford-hoffman\">All the President’s Men</a> (1976).</p> <p>The perspicacious Redford had bought an option on the book by the Washington Post journalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/carl-bernstein\">Carl Bernstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/26/pressandpublishing.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">Bob Woodward</a> prior to its publication in 1974 for $450,000. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/25/william-goldman-screenwriter-interview\">William Goldman</a>, who had written three buddy movies in a row for Redford – Butch Cassidy, The Hot Rock (with Segal, 1972) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfZhXhCGwEA\">The Great Waldo Pepper</a> (with Bo Svenson, 1975) – was hired to supply another one for the star and Hoffman, delivering a sort of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Bring Down the Government”, as one Washington Post wit described it.</p>    <p>Of the two leads, Redford had the edge, managing to combine a dry humour, a convincing intelligence and a determined idealism. According to Hoffman, the reason the film was a top earner was because “it is what the public always wanted: that beautiful Wasp finally wound up with a nice Jewish boy”.</p> <p>In the 80s, Redford gradually scaled down his acting, appearing in only four films, having taken up producing and directing. At the same time, he established the Sundance Institute on his 7,000-acre estate in Provo, Utah, providing workshops, development resources and support to promising independent film-makers. </p> <p>In 1978, Redford co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival\">Sundance film festival,</a> held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah every January as a shop window for independent cinema, and remained a godfather to it. A passionate environmentalist, he also co-founded the Institute for Resource Management, a forum to encourage land developers and environmentalists to work together.</p> <p>In later acting assignments, he was shown in a noble, almost saintly, light, consistently backlit to turn his golden hair into a saintly halo: as a prison reformer in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVzHtmJR7g\">Brubaker</a> (1980), a mythical baseball player in The Natural (1984), and the English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (though there was no attempt to get the accent),the lover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/29/margaret-atwood-isak-dinesen\">Karen Blixen</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/reel-history-out-of-africa\">Out of Africa</a> (1985).</p> <p>Redford’s first film as a director, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKkcyK1VpGY\">Ordinary People</a> (1980), was a middle-class family drama, elegantly shot though not very original, with a sentimental father-son solution. Nevertheless, the film won Oscars for best picture and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Trc1lkc6Lo\">best director</a> – Redford went on to win an honorary Oscar, too, in 2002 – as well as best supporting actor, for Timothy Hutton, and best adapted screenplay. Its success encouraged Redford to continue directing over the next decades.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaKVk4hNAY\">The Milagro Beanfield War</a> (1988) was a homespun fable of a New Mexican farmer deflecting water from a housing development to start his own beanfield. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7yeXtBQMU\">A River Runs Through It</a> (1992), shot in Montana (Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for his cinematography), used fly-fishing as a metaphor for life in an understated way; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/dec/14/quiz-show-robert-redford\">Quiz Show</a> (1994) was a gripping account of a television scandal in 50s America, when a winning contestant of a popular programme was exposed as a fraud.</p> <p>Redford directed himself for the first time in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_1dKoCQlxY\">The Horse Whisperer</a> (1998), as a Montana cowboy who cures traumatised horses, a role that fitted him as snugly as his faded denims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">The Legend of Bagger Vance </a>(2000), continued his almost mystic interest in sport with a nostalgic look at golf between the wars, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/thriller.tomcruise\">Lions for Lambs </a>(2007) was a flabbily liberal and verbose response to the Iraq war.</p> <p>He starred in and directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/ricki-flash-wolfpack-company-you-keep-heist-on-the-beach-review\">The Company You Keep</a> (2012), a well-intentioned political drama on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jul/04/artsfeatures2\">Weather Underground</a> 30 years after their terrorist activities. Yet, though one would be hard put to call Redford an auteur, there is no denying that his choice of films reflected his political views and his passion for the American west.</p> <p>From the 90s, the reasons for some of his acting choices were a trifle less clear. In Adrian Lyne’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kA0MydxWUo\">Indecent Proposal</a> (1993), Redford’s character, admitting to advanced middle-age, offers to pay $1m to sleep with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/demi-moore\">Demi Moore</a>, with her husband’s approval. He finally gave in to advancing years at the age of 68 and played a crusty and grizzled rancher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/24/features\">Lasse Hallstrom</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/16/drama\">An Unfinished Life</a> (2005), the sort of role Newman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/clinteastwood\">Clint Eastwood</a> had been playing for years.</p> <p>Never straying too far from his persona of dignified masculinity, Redford continued to be active into his 80s. His solo performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/26/all-is-lost-review\">All Is Lost</a> (2013) as a castaway seaman trying to survive was a tour de force, while he demonstrated his fitness in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/a-walk-in-the-woods-review-robert-redford-bill-bryson\">A Walk in the Woods</a> (2015), and his integrity as the TV anchor Don Rather in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/truth-review-cate-blanchett-60-minutes-george-w-bush-war-record\">Truth</a> (2015). His last substantial role was as the real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker in the comedy drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/the-old-man-the-gun-review-robert-redford-sissy-spacek-casey-affleck\">The Old Man &amp; the Gun</a> (2018).</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, an artist, whom he married in 2009 after a long relationship, and three children, Shauna, James and Amy, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1985.</p> <p>• Robert Redford, actor, producer and director, born 18 August 1936; died 16 September 2025</p> <p>• Ronald Bergan died in 2020</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jay Miller’s account of teaching philosophy in prison is powerful and welcome (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/09/teaching-philosophy-in-prison-college-students-inmates\">‘You want to talk about a world of lies?’ Teaching philosophy in prison, 9 September</a>). This kind of “public philosophy”, which includes the excluded, is of profound value, he&nbsp;argues. Remarkably, philosophy in prisons is “A kaleidoscopic assortment of jokes, stories, anecdotes and philosophical insights …” This picture is familiar for the UK charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.philosophyinprison.com/\">Philosophy in&nbsp;Prison</a><em>. </em></p> <p>The puzzle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56yN2zHtofM\">Trigger’s broom</a>, for example, can generate a joyous discussion of identity, time, the rights of work, relativism, freedom and responsibility, and happiness –&nbsp;where the whole room is focused&nbsp;and participating.</p> <p>For such intractable questions, no one in the room has a definitive answer, neither the “professional” philosophers, nor those wondering about Trigger for the first time. So philosophical discussion has an equalising effect – everyone is puzzled, no one is disqualified from having a view, nor from arguing it well. It seems obvious that this kind of work is important for its own sake as well as for its effect on&nbsp;participants. But one feature of the prison population in the UK that Miller does not address directly is the high levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons\">functional illiteracy</a>.</p> <p>Offering prisoners university courses works for those who read and feel comfortable with writing. But philosophy can be done just by conversation, to include both those with high levels of education and those who have little. Anyone may participate; disagreement itself generates a toleration that manifests itself on the wing; and educational doors open afterwards. Philosophy in Prison does philosophy just by talking, in the anomalous public space of prison, and it matters&nbsp;for&nbsp;anyone in the room.<br><strong>Mary Margaret McCabe</strong><br><em>Professor of </em><em>ancient </em><em>philosophy </em><em>emerita, King’s College London; </em><em>Chair of trustees, Philosophy in Prison</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by Sydney Pollack, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to F Scott Fitzgerald’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-obituary\">Robert Redford obituary</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c993938f0862eec18cf422\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T16:44:10.087Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Film director James Gunn shared a tribute to Redford on Instagram and wrote: “I grew up with his [Redford’s] movies: his quiet, unforced performances and ever-present grace.

It’s got some great 1970s Hollywood moments: doubts about Redford as leading man, Steve McQueen bailing on the project over who would get top billing and daft amounts of money being thrown around by inexperienced producers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Newman was Goldman’s choice from the moment the film was bought, but the casting for Sundance was trickier. Fox initially wanted Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in a 1958 western called <em>Cowboy </em>along with Glenn Ford. Lemmon was not keen on spending a lot of time riding horses again and told them he was not interested. The studio then turned their attention to Steve McQueen and although he liked the script, he dropped out, reportedly in a disagreement over who got top billing.</p> <p>Newman’s wife Joanne Woodward suggested 32-year-old Redford, who had appeared in a few films but was better known as a stage actor. Zanuck, who was a production manager on the film, thought Redford was too lightweight for the role and changed his mind only after seeing raw footage of Newman and Redford together and realising that they had a true chemistry on screen.</p> <p>“I wasn’t that well known at the time and although my agency thought I would be right for the part, 20th Century didn’t want me,”<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/robert-redford-dead-sundance-kid-age-cause-b2582661.html\"> Redford </a>told a television interviewer more than 40 years later. “They wanted Steve McQueen.

I thought he was great.”</p> <p>Redford’s stance on Trump changed over the years. In 2015 he told Larry King: “Look he’s got such a big foot in his mouth, I’m not sure you’re going to get it out. But on the other hand, I’m glad he’s in there.”</p>    <p>He added: “I’m glad he’s in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that’s very needed. Because on the other side, it’s so bland, it’s so boring, it’s so empty.”</p> <p>Four years later during the calls for Trump’s impeachment, Redford’s opinion shifted. “It is painfully clear we have a president who degrades everything he touches,” he wrote in a Washington Post comment piece. “A person who does not understand (or care?) that his duty is to defend our democracy.”</p> <p>He expanded on those thoughts later in the same year, admitting he wanted to “give the guy a chance” when Trump was first elected.

But it was his first pairing with Sting co-star Paul Newman that distils the performer’s essence. Although the movie is unable to fess up to its bromantic longings – did any woman in a buddy movie ever look more like a gooseberry than poor Katharine Ross? – it’s still worth seeing for Redford’s sunny charm. Even then, it seemed to trouble him faintly, as though he was worried we might take him for a himbo. The studio did. “He’s just another California blond,” said one executive. “Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him.” But Newman helped win him the part. Redford got a shock when he saw the first cut. “I said: ‘What the hell is that song doing in there? Raindrops? It’s not even raining. On a bicycle?’”</p> </blockquote> <p>The full top ten is:</p> <p>10. Brubaker (1980)</p> <p>9. The Twilight Zone – “Nothing in the Dark” (1962)</p> <p>8. The Great Gatsby (1974)</p> <p>7.

It spans his early career as an unlikely star and includes his honorary Oscar and the award of his Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p> <p>There are a couple of entries that cover his collaborations with Paul Newman, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (poster above). Here’s an excerpt from Scott Tobias’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">50th anniversary piece</a> from 2019:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford’s taciturn sharpshooter. But he’s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn’t have the stomach for violence; it’s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he’s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He’s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him.</p> <p>Audiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/true-grit-john-wayne-1969-henry-hathaway\">True Grit</a> had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre’s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s. With Ross at the center of a love triangle between friends, the film attempted to bring Jules and Jim to the American mainstream, taking a lesson from the French new wave on how to revivify old Hollywood craft.</p> <p>It still works spectacularly well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full gallery is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-a-life-in-pictures\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c964268f0862eec18cf0e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbradshaw\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T13:22:38.305Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Robert Redford began his career as a blond bombshell at a time when American cinema favoured grit, then turned into a supremely assured director and unlikely keeper of the indie flame, writes Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw in his appreciation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, it wasn’t cool for star actors to be good-looking. The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a> was very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.</p> <p>When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> in 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustaches, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the Jazz Age conmen caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs.

We don’t have enough to support everybody.”</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to three food business owners in LA about the summer of Ice, and how it’s affected their families and businesses.</p> <h2>Juan Carlos Guerra, Taqueria Frontera</h2> <p>It’s Los Angeles … you drive anywhere on the street, you’re going to see pop-ups. You’re going to see street vendors. But it just seemed like a ghost town during that time. No one was out on the street.</p> <p>I was going to open the new Silver Lake location of Taqueria Frontera at the beginning of June. And then the raids happened. It didn’t seem like we should have a celebration or a grand opening.</p> <p>I reached out to Javier Cabral from [the hyperlocal news site] LA Taco, and I said to him, “I want to try to help out. Whatever I can do. Do you know a good organization?” And he said: “Oh, yeah. <a href=\"https://mycielo.org/\">CIELO</a> is a great organization.”</p> <p>I talked to someone at CIELO, Comunidades Indígenas en Liderazgo (Indigenous Communities in Leadership). I was just like: “Taco Tuesday is usually a thing. Is it okay if I set up something saying that all proceeds of our trompo [taco] – which is what we sell the most – is going to be donated towards fundraising for CIELO so they can help immigrant families during this time?”</p> <p>We did Taco Tuesday with a purpose, and we ended up raising $4,000 from selling the trompo that day alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues</p> <footer> <cite>Bulmaro, street vendor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone was pretty supportive about it. And not just that day – a lot of people would come in just to check up on us, on my employees, see how they’re doing, how they’re feeling. There’s no way you could live in Los Angeles without being affected by this. And a lot of my clients were like: “I can’t believe this is going on.” Who doesn’t have a friend or family member or co-worker that isn’t undocumented here in Los Angeles?</p> <p>Street vendors are back out now and more people are outside eating. But I think that it’s still in the back of their minds. Could this happen at any time again? Right now it’s pretty calm, but what happens a month from now if they decide to do it again?</p> <h2>Bulmaro, street vendor</h2> <p>When we started the business, there weren’t many jobs out there. We knew how to make tamales, which is what we sell. Due to the lack of jobs and opportunities, we decided to do what we know how to do. From there, business grew and we started getting more clients, little by little. It’s our sole source of income.</p> <p>Because of the raids, everything stopped. We stopped selling for about a month, without working or anything. We just started working again a little more about two weeks ago. A lot of people don’t go out to buy things anymore because they’re scared. Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues.</p> <p>We haven’t had phone orders, either. We just bring the day’s supply, and sometimes we come back home with tamales or with atol that didn’t sell. It’s never going to be the same as before the raids.</p>    <p>It’s me, my wife and another employee – three of us depend on the business. There’s nothing we can do, we have to keep working. We need to pay rent and bills, even though we’re going outside with fear. There’s no other way. The rent isn’t going to wait. The bills, and the food we need to buy, aren’t going to wait either.</p> <h2>Alejandra Rodriguez, Alex Foods and Cemitas Poblanas</h2> <p>A lot of our customers stopped coming. They were scared because a lot of them are Latino. Even at the local restaurants in the city of West Hollywood, [the workers] have their visas to be here, but they were still scared because of everything that was going on. They were saying that even if you had a visa, even if you had permission to be here, everybody was still getting kicked out. Our sales dropped more than 70%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/13/ice-immigration-raids-food-labor\">How US immigration raids hurt summer pleasures, from berries to barbecues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even on the street, there was nobody walking, nobody coming.

And luckily, we had a little bit of money saved up. Usually, when we leave on trips, customers will still call us to place orders. But no, the whole 10 days we were gone, we didn’t go to work. We didn’t get any calls or people asking us when we were going to come back.</p> <p>I had to let one of my two employees go. I couldn’t afford it anymore. And we’ve just slowly been climbing back. We have customers from the local car washes, and they told us that Ice actually got there at that car wash and took about four people. People are still aware. People are still scared. Any time they see a police officer pass by or a sheriff’s department or just somebody, they would flinch.</p> <p>People are just trying to get to work and come back.

The crowd loudly chanted the name. The focus of this acclamation was not Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, the organiser of the so-called “free speech” march in central London last Saturday.</p> \n<p>They were instead shouting themselves hoarse for Charlie Kirk, the murdered political activist from Cook County in the US state of Illinois.</p> \n<p>It is unlikely that many of the 110,000 to 150,000 protesters estimated to have been on the streets last weekend, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">what turned out to be the largest rally of its type in British history</a>,<strong> </strong>knew much about Kirk before his death at the hands of a gunman at Utah Valley University.</p> \n<p>The UK version of Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which claims to be the “largest Conservative student movement” in the US, has never really taken off in Britain.</p> \n<p>But they were moved to cheer him on Saturday. Clips of an almost entirely white and predominantly male crowd of Britons chanting the first name of the murdered 31-year-old were lapped up on social media accounts said to be US-based, as was the minute’s silence afterwards.</p> \n<p>“Thousands of British patriots just fell silent in honor of Charlie Kirk in London,” tweeted Eric Daugherty, an assistant news director at the conservative Florida’s Voice website (“Honest political reporting to Florida, minus the mainstream talking points.”)</p> \n<p>It is said that when America coughs, Britain catches a cold.</p> \n<p>The reality with this strain of politics is that there is something of a feedback loop between the US and the UK that is proving mutually beneficial to both sides, said Prof Paul Jackson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pride-in-prejudice-9781526156723/\">Pride in Prejudice: Understanding Britain’s Extreme Right</a>.</p> \n<p>Kirk may not have been a household name in the UK but his murder offered validation for a view that a certain outlook on life is under threat. In turn, the scenes on Saturday provided evidence of the righteousness of the cause back in the US.</p> \n<p>There is history to this mutually enforcing exchange of ideas on the extreme right, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>A certain type of US political thought has never travelled well across the Atlantic, notably the Ku Klux Klan, which grew after the civil war in the late 1860s, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>But other ideas have thrived in the past as they do today, including those contained in Madison Grant’s 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, which influenced some European white supremacists, and Henry Ford’s The International Jew.</p> \n<p>It has not all been one way. The Blood &amp; Honour movement, founded by British neo-Nazi and white power music pioneer Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987, led to the birth of Blood &amp; Honour American Division and Blood &amp; Honour Council US.</p> \n<p>That was the analogue age, though.</p> \n<p>In the digital era, particularly in the so-called “counter-jihad” space that now dominates what is loosely termed the far right, the mutual reinforcement of messages is done in real time. Stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another.</p> \n<p>Kirk himself was one of those who picked up on the case of Lucy Connolly, the 42-year-old English woman –married to a Conservative councillor – who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for calling for hotels that were housing asylum seekers to be burned down during last summer’s riots.<strong> </strong>(She was released in August after serving less than half her sentence.)</p> \n<p>“Every day people say: ‘Well someone should go kill Charlie Kirk.’ I don’t like it, but that is protected speech,” he told GB News. “In America, we care what you do and not what you say.”</p> \n<p>It was of a piece with the general claim that free speech is under threat in the UK, confirmed in the mind of the likes of JD Vance by the UK’s Online Safety Act, aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content, which the US vice-president claims has put Britain on a “very dark path”.</p> \n<p>The amplification of certain causes, the repetition of choice phrases, cannot be said to be highly organised, but it is nonetheless powerful.</p> \n<p>The Infowars website, founded by the prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, promoted Robinson’s content about the rally on Saturday, but also that of a series of obscure accounts on X, said to be based in both the UK and the US.</p> \n<p>“Breaking: London falls silent for fallen hero Charlie Kirk,” said one such account with 335,700 followers that described itself as a defender of western values and culture. “The British media hated him. The British people certainly didn’t.”</p> \n<p>Another account promoted by Jones’s site was that of Naomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer linked to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, who is known for her climate change denial and promotion of “great replacement theory” tropes.</p> \n<p>She tweeted images from the rally to her 436,700 followers that included the words: “White children will grow up as patriots from now on. White guilt is over.”</p> \n<p>Brigitte Gabriel, founder of the anti-Muslim movement Act for America, which claims to have 1,000 local chapters across the US, posted on X: “Don’t let the media downplay how massive this is. Millions of patriots in the UK are standing up for free speech.”</p> \n<p>Then there is Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">who appeared via videolink at Saturday’s rally</a>. It would be difficult to overplay the importance to Robinson of the support of one of the world’s richest men, according to analysts including the Hope Not Hate anti-extremist organisation.</p> \n<p>In lifting the ban on Robinson’s content on X and through his own misleading posts framing him as a free speech warrior persecuted by the state, Musk gave the activist a vital leg-up, it is argued.</p> \n<p>Robinson, a former member of the racist British National party, who has a string of convictions to his name including for assault, using a fake passport, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, is said to have been able to build upon his profile in the US, stir up protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers while pushing anti-immigrant messages that circle around a supposed threat of Islamisation to the UK.</p> \n<p>“When you hear people talk about the special relationship between America and Great Britain, this is the special relationship that you’re seeing here,” Robinson said at the rally.</p> \n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd, in turn.</p> \n<p>Musk is not yet believed to have directly funded anyone in the UK, although he reportedly flirted with offering money to Reform, the rising political party on the right that is led by Nigel Farage. But such transatlantic relationships do exist, albeit they tend to remain below the radar. It is a murky soup – but some of the chunkier players can be made out.</p> \n<p>One is the US tech billionaire Robert Shillman, known as Dr Bob, who in 2018 financed a fellowship that helped pay for Robinson to be employed by the rightwing Canadian media website, Rebel Media, now called Rebel News, on a salary of about £5,000 a month.</p> \n<p>Other Shillman fellows have included Katie Hopkins, the English former reality TV star who compared migrants to cockroaches, and Laura Loomer, the American conspiracy theorist referred to by some as the president’s “de facto national security adviser”.</p> \n<p>The rightwing Middle East Forum thinktank, led by the neoconservative academic Daniel Pipes, has paid for foreign speakers to attend Robinson rallies in the past, in addition to funding the activist’s legal defence.</p> \n<p>There are laws against foreign donations in both the US and the UK but the far-right echo chamber is also clearly a useful tool for those seeking electoral success on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>Trump has had no qualms about bouncing off certain British causes, sometimes unadvisedly. He said he was prepared to apologise in 2018 when he retweeted posts from Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP. But he is notably cautious about certain characters.</p> \n<p>Trump, who will be in the UK for a state visit this week, did not comment on social media about Saturday’s rally. He appears to prefer his outriders to do the work at times, including his son.</p> \n<p>When the rightwing activist Kurt Schlichter claimed – falsely – on X that Robinson had been arrested for reporting on a court case in May 2018, Donald Trump Jr retweeted it, writing: “Reason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.”</p> \n<p>In the UK, Farage, who successfully fought for decades for the UK to leave the European Union and is today riding high in the polls with his anti-immigration populism, has sought to keep a sterile gap between himself and Robinson, who he fears is beyond the pale for much of the British public.</p> \n<p>He steps carefully in the digital space, seeking support but without getting too close to the most strident actors, including those in the US. He is notably quite loth to associate himself too much with Trump these days when he is at home in the UK, given the US president’s poor approval ratings among the British public.</p> \n<p>But his long-standing ties to the Make America Great Again movement remain financially advantageous. This week, Farage apologised for breaching parliamentary rules by failing to register a trip to Florida to headline a fundraising event for Trump. He had been the main speaker at the $500-a-head Republican party dinner in Tallahassee in March.</p> \n<p>Farage hopes to benefit from the promotion of anti-immigrant themes in the digital world, including from US commentators, without putting off those with more mainstream outlooks, say insiders. It will be a difficult trick to get away with – as Musk’s criticism of Farage at the start of the year over his lack of support for Robinson illustrated.</p> \n<p>“British people are kind of looking for an international source of inspiration,” said Jackson. “[Then] some of the reason why somebody like Nigel Farage or Tommy Robinson might be of particular interest in the US is because they’ve had a lot of success in their own terms.</p> \n<p>“Tommy Robinson’s social media profile of the last few years has been highly impactful, even more so since [Musk] reversing his ban from Twitter. Nigel Farage’s impact on Britain shortly before Trump’s first presidency can be seen as perhaps providing some blueprints about how to have impact.”</p> \n<p>Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s long-standing press adviser until he left Reform earlier this year, said he believed the American interest in shaping British politics was also instinctive.</p> \n<p>“Trump sees the UK as the spiritual home of the US,” he said. “He sees our traditional political and legal traditions as the spiritual background to America’s right.</p> \n<p>“Musk certainly feels that way. He sees the UK as the spiritual homeland of the concepts of the American Declaration of Independence and its bill of rights and all the rest of it. This is where freedom was born, right? It’s like losing a great-uncle if it falls.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Big pharmaceutical companies have ditched or paused nearly £2bn in planned UK investments so far this year, causing “suffering” to patients, as ministers gear up for discussions with Donald Trump amid a row over drug pricing.</p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-sector-plan/life-sciences-sector-plan\">plan for the life science sector</a>, a key pillar of the economy, has been thrown into disarray, after US drugmaker MSD’s shock announcement last Wednesday that it would scrap its £1bn London research centre. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/astrazeneca-pauses-200m-investment-in-cambridge-research-site\">AstraZeneca decided to halt a planned £200m expansion</a> of its research facilities in Cambridge.</p> <p>Combined with a scrapped project by AstraZeneca in Liverpool and a shelved Eli Lilly lab in London, four projects worth more than £1.8bn have been pulled or paused this year. In total, decisions over 13 major projects or companies have damaged the UK’s pharma industry since 2022, also including site closures and stock market delistings.</p> <p>Pharma companies have accused the government of not spending enough on new medicines, arguing that there is little incentive for them to develop drugs and test them in a country that does not value innovation sufficiently.</p> <p>More recriminations are expected when MPs on the science, innovation and technology committee question MSD’s UK and Ireland managing director, Ben Lucas, about its decision on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>He will appear alongside AstraZeneca UK president Tom Keith-Roach, Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry chief executive Richard Torbett and representatives of the government, including the science minister Lord Vallance, a former GSK executive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\" data-alt=\"Pharma cancellations map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens, asked the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d15efe-e802-497a-a995-87ca7fdcbe7b\">to offer drug companies a better deal on pricing</a> when the two met at a private dinner in London recently, the Financial Times reported. The intervention came before Trump’s visit to the UK this week. The US president has criticised foreign nations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/01/australia-pbs-medicine-drugs-prices-trump-tariffs\">“freeloading on US innovation”</a>. Drug prices are much higher in the US and companies have been accused of “price gouging” in the past.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Guy Oliver, the UK head of the US drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), told the Times that, because of “chronic underinvestment” in medicines, the US drugmaker had cancelled 34 partnerships with the NHS in the past year. “There is a human cost to all of this. Patients are really suffering, and have been suffering for many, many years now,” he said.</p> <p>A BMS spokesperson said: <em>“</em>Bristol Myers Squibb agrees with the US administration that the UK pays too little for medicines. As a result of today’s commercial and policy environment in the UK, we have materially reduced the size of our UK organisation over the last four years, and we continue to evaluate our level of investment in the country.”</p> <p>Drugmakers have become more vocal over the UK’s shortcomings since months-long <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/media/news/2025/august/accelerated-review-of-vpag-concludes-without-agreement/\">negotiations over drug pricing</a> broke down in late August, when the health secretary, Wes Streeting, gave companies an ultimatum over his latest “generous” offer – but was rejected.</p>    <p>This means that the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing, access and growth, under which pharma companies pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">continues at a rate the industry says is “unsustainable”</a>. The minimum <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/publications/creating-the-conditions-for-investment-and-growth/\">clawback rate of 23.5% for newer medicines is much higher</a> than payment rates in other European countries.</p> <p>A government spokesperson indicated it was willing to reopen talks but stuck to its previous offer, saying: “Our door remains open to future engagement.”</p> <p>MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would discontinue all research and development activities in the UK, which means 125 scientists based at the Francis Crick Institute and the London BioScience Innovation Centre will lose their jobs. </p>    <p>Also last week, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly said its planned London Gateway Lab, part of a £279m investment, was on hold, “as we are awaiting more clarity around the UK life sciences environment”.</p> <p>Britain’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, which was at the forefront of the government’s efforts to make Covid vaccines available during the pandemic, already pulled the plug on the £450m expansion of its vaccine site in Speke in Liverpool in January after failing to agree a state support package.</p> <p>The French pharma group Sanofi’s UK head of market access, Paul Naish, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">has said substantial investment is now on hold</a>. “This is an intolerable situation for too many [patients] in this country and that is why government needs to work with the sector,” he said.</p> <p>The Swiss drugmaker Novartis is also holding off future investments in UK manufacturing or research, it is understood. Over the past 16 years, it has scaled back its UK operations from seven sites and more than 4,000 employees to one site in London housing 1,200 staff. </p>    <p>Meanwhile, Germany’s BioNTech said its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/1-billion-biontech-investment-sets-way-for-jobs-growth-breakthroughs\">£1bn, 10-year partnership with the UK government</a>, aimed at speeding up trials of its cancer medications, remained on track. Several hundred patients have been treated with experimental cancer immunotherapies through the collaboration, and new research centres are planned in London and Cambridge.</p> <p>The US biotech Moderna, known for its Covid vaccine, opened a new vaccine manufacturing site in Harwell, Oxfordshire in May.</p> <h2><strong>Scrapped/paused investments, delistings and site closures in the UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>September</strong> AstraZeneca pauses £200m research lab in Cambridge (1,000 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September </strong>Merck scraps £1bn London research centre (125 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September</strong> Eli Lilly pauses London Gateway lab, part of £279m investment</p> <p><strong>2025</strong><strong>-26</strong> Haleon closing Maidenhead site (435 jobs)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Indivior: based in Slough, delisted from London Stock Exchange (LSE)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Verona Pharma: based in London, sold to MSD after delisting from LSE in 2020</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Adaptimmune Therapeutics sells four cell therapy assets to US WorldMeds and cuts UK workforce by 62%</p> <p><strong>June</strong> GSK shuts Ulverston factory (100 jobs) and makes cuts at Barnard Castle in October (200 jobs)</p> <p><strong>January</strong> AstraZeneca scraps £450m investment in Speke, Liverpool</p> <p><strong>January</strong> Rentschler Biopharma closes Stevenage site (30 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2024</strong> Sanofi reduced its Kymab labs in Cambridge (50 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2023</strong> Recipharm closes Queenborough site on Isle of Sheppey (150 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2022</strong> Novartis sells Grimsby site (200+ jobs)</p>",

He had voted for Starmer in the 2020 contest was now “quite unfavourable” about Keir Starmer and summed it up by saying: ‘<em>The leadership needs to be made aware how unhappy the members are with the direction of government and how it’s functioning.

Agnes was the youngest.</p> <p>Agnes lived in Nanyuki for all of her 21 years, and if she ever travelled it was only to visit her sister Cecilia, who lived several hours away.</p> <p>She started her primary education at a school in Nanyuki, DEB primary, and later joined Gakawa secondary school. She enjoyed lessons and her favourite subject was literature. She also loved music; she would often be caught singing or dancing.</p> <p>She enjoyed busying herself in the kitchen and spending her spare time with her extended family. As a sister, daughter and aunt, Agnes was dependable and kind, her family said, and she was also funny.</p> <p>“She was always joking, smiling,” said her niece Esther Njoki. “We were always laughing because of her jokes.”</p> <p>Growing up, Agnes would look after her younger nieces, spending time braiding their hair. Later, she turned her hobby into her career; she began training to be hairdresser in 2010. She finished her course in August 2011. Just a few months later, before she had had a chance to properly start out in her new career, she was dead.</p> <p>While she completed her studies, Agnes was also heavily pregnant. Her daughter Stacey was born on 20 October that year. “Agnes’s feelings about becoming a mum was [that it was] the best feeling ever,” Esther Njoki said.</p> <p>She loved her baby daughter but struggled to provide for her, and like many young women in Nanyuki, Agnes would make extra money from selling sex. Batuk, the British army training base nearby, provided a steady flow of custom.</p> <p>Soldiers would come into Nanyuki to drink and socialise and many would pay for sex with local women, often several in one night, paying them as little as the equivalent of £1 a time.</p> <p>Agnes would go to bars in the town to meet her friends, and dance. The night she disappeared, 31 March 2012, started like many others. She went to the Lion’s Court hotel, a favourite haunt of British soldiers, to meet her friends Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.</p> <p>They remembered her joining them at about 11pm and the three women dancing together. Agnes was drinking a beer that she told her friends had been bought for her by a British soldier.</p> <p>Instead of returning home to her sister, her daughter and her niece as she had every other night, Agnes disappeared. The next morning, her friends and family had not heard from her. They went to the hotel where she had last been seen, and spent weeks searching for Agnes, until her body was discovered two months later.</p> <p>Agnes’s death has had a lasting effect on her family. Stacey was five months old when she lost her mother and will not remember her but has been deeply affected after learning how she died.</p> <p>“We have been having moments where she sees something about her mum and she breaks down,” Njoki said, “and that’s because of trauma.”</p> <p>Njoki and her mother, Rose, have carried the heavy burden of Agnes’s death for 13 years. “You just keep on thinking about Agnes, about the case, and you just feel bad,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s really traumatising, for sure, and saddening, and our hearts [are broken].”</p>",

    "description": "<ul><li><p>World champion says ‘only matter of time’ to reach 9.6sec</p></li><li><p>Seville dismisses effect of Noah Lyles’ mind games</p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>On Sunday night, Oblique Seville became the first Jamaican to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/14/oblique-seville-men-100m-final-world-athletics-championships\">win the men’s 100m world title</a> since Usain Bolt. But it turns out the 24-year-old’s mind is just as quick as his blistering leg speed.</p> <p>In an interview to celebrate his victory, Seville was asked if he were to design a sprinter what would he look like. The questioner expected a long answer. Perhaps Justin Gatlin’s start, Michael Johnson’s mentality, and Bolt’s leg speed.</p> <p>But one word came back from Seville’s mouth almost instantaneously. “Usain.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/gout-gout-world-athletics-championships-200m-heat-preview\">Time comes for Gout Gout to prove himself against sprinting’s best emerging talent | Jack Snape </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s never been anyone like him, has there?” he’s asked. “No,” Seville said. “But I would take his last part of his race and my start. Then you would have the perfect sprinter.”</p> <p>However, there is one issue that Seville disagrees with his hero about. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/i-get-out-of-breath-walking-up-the-stairs-these-days-usain-bolt-admits\">Bolt insisted the current generation did not have the talent</a> to run the 100m in the 9.6sec, like he, Yohan Blake and Tyson Gay once did. Seville, who ran a personal best of 9.77sec to win gold in Tokyo, disagreed.</p> <p>“In my opinion, it’s just only a matter of time before someone is going to run 9.6,” he said. “I don’t think we are far off in this generation. It just takes us time. Because you have to understand, it was the same back then.</p> <p>“No one was running 9.6 until Usain Bolt put his foot in Beijing. So it’s for us now, as a new generation, for us to just meet that step. To prove that we can actually do the same thing that Usain did.”</p> <p>The difference between Seville and Bolt could barely be more pronounced. Both hail from Jamaica but Bolt was 6ft 5in and weighed about 14st, and Seville is 5ft 6in and just 11st 6lb. Seville loves going to church and said he prepared for the 100m final by reading the Bible “which gave me a lot of peace of mind”. Bolt, it is fair to say, had a rather different approach.</p> <p>However, the men share the same coach: Glen Mills. And it was Mills who always believed that Seville could emulate Bolt by becoming the fastest man on the planet.</p> <p>“I realised that I was a fast kid when I was six,” said Seville. “I was running against kids that were bigger than me and I was very competitive. So I showed it at a very early age.</p> <p>“When I just started out with my coach, he said it’s going to take me a few years to get to the podium. And whatever he says, that is what’s going to happen. His words manifested upon me and here I am right now, a gold medallist.</p> <p>“He can be tough at times and he’s a good guy because he’s a very intelligent guy. And I learn a lot from him in and out of sport. He guides me mentally and shows me my career, physically.”</p> <p>Since Bolt left the sport in 2017, the crown of the world champion has slipped, light-fingered, through the hands of Gatlin, Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Noah Lyles. Could Seville, who was one of the favourites for gold in Paris, be the one that holds on to the crown? He hopes so. But he knows it will be difficult.</p> <p>“I have the mentality. But you know that injuries are a part of the sport,” said Seville. “And because of my height and size I cannot make any mistakes. I have to ensure that everything that I do is on point.”</p> <p>That mentality was also strong when the American Lyles tried to play mind games on the Jamaicans before the final. “It doesn’t have any effect on me,” said Seville. “Because over the years I realised that Noah is going to be Noah. And he’s going to talk.</p> <p>“I respect that. It’s good for the sport. It might have worked on other athletes but not me. I came to the world championship for one purpose. To win the gold.” And he did that, all right.</p>  ",

A boundary-laden cameo from Joe Clarke (29) and an unbeaten 30 from Brett Hutton apart, the visiting batsmen struggled to assert their authority.</p> <p>Fisher enjoyed his first five-wicket haul for Surrey since he moved from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> last winter. “We did what we usually do, hunt like a pack,” he said after play. “I felt like I’ve put in decent areas all season, sometimes I’m lacking that little bit of nip but I had it today.” And on watching his bowling partner: “I’m purring at mid-on watching Gus.” Ben Foakes finished with five catches.</p> <p>As the shadows spread over the ground like a rash, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley did what they do, playing a straight and steady bat. Then from nowhere, Dillon Pennington made one spit off the pitch and Sibley got a lick as it passed by. The batter threw his head back in frustration as he had to trudge back to the pavilion, out for 14 with just nine balls left.</p> <p>The high winds which delayed play around all the grounds (except the Riverside, which was affected purely by rain) did so because of the risks to ground staff and spectators in handling flat covers, including the covers lifting staff off the ground, or blowing loose and hitting the crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c922b08f084793c7c16363\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scores on the doors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>Division One</strong></h2> <p><strong>Riverside:</strong> Durham v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire\">Worcestershire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Taunton:</strong> Somerset v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire\">Hampshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>The Oval:</strong> Surrey 43-1 v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nottinghamshire\">Nottinghamshire</a> 231</p> <p><strong>Hove:</strong> Sussex v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Edgbaston:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc\">Warwickshire</a> v Essex <em> </em></p> <h2><strong>Division Two</strong></h2> <p><strong>The County Ground:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/derbyshire\">Derbyshire</a> v Glamorgan <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Bristol:</strong> Gloucestershire v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonshire\">Northamptonshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Old Trafford:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire\">Lancashire</a> v Middlesex <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Grace Road:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestershire\">Leicestershire</a> v Kent </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c7defb8f086519d3272613\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning</strong> from The Oval where the Hobbs gates are open, the sky is periwinkle, and Surrey are on top in this crucial Championship arm wrestle.

    "content": "<p>First Tokyo witnessed the spectacular. Then came a divine act of Faith.</p> <p>In the women’s 400m, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran one of the fastest times in history, easing down, to raise the question of whether one of the oldest – and most controversial – track and field records might fall later this week.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards another standout female of her generation, Faith Kipyegon, underlined her status by speeding to a historic fourth 1500m title with such grace and distance that it took the breath away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both women have long stood tall in athletics’ pantheon. What they do in the coming days could reinforce their case to be considered as the greatest female athlete of all time.</p> <p>McLaughlin-Levrone, of course, already holds numerous gold medals and world records in the 400m hurdles. But now, suddenly, she has the 400m gold and possibly even the world record of 47.60 sec set by Marita Koch in 1985 in her sights too.</p> <p>The American showed that by running 48.29 sec in Tuesday’s semi-final – smashing her personal best by nearly half a second – and then promising to run faster in Thursday’s final.</p> <p>“This race definitely gives me confidence for the final,” she said. “I didn’t expect to run this fast today. And I still have more to show.”</p> <p>That sounds ominous for Koch, who has long been alleged to be part of East Germany’s state-sponsored doping programme, in books and newspaper articles. When asked about it by the BBC in 2014, she replied: “I don’t have to prove anything to myself. I have a clear conscience. I can only repeat myself … I never tested positive, I never did anything which I should not have done at that time.”</p> <p>Koch did acknowledge the fact that the record would ultimately be overtaken, though, saying that “at some point, that time will come”. It could even be on Thursday .</p> <p>However, McLaughlin-Levrone will not have things completely her own way given that the Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and the former world champion Salwa Eid Naser are running well.</p> <p>They will be joined in the final by Britain’s Amber Anning, who ran 49.38sec to automatically qualify. “I’m in such great shape,” she insisted.</p> <p>Paulino is even more confident, promising: “God and I will make history here.”</p> <p>The 31-year-old Kipyegon has already done that. On Tuesday she matched Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four world 1500m titles.</p> <p>With 300m to go Kipyegon, who broke her own world record earlier this year, looked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/australias-jess-hull-takes-1500m-bronze-after-brave-race-against-kenya-legend-faith-kipyegon\">under threat from the Australian Jessica Hull</a>. But then she applied the afterburners and the race was put to bed long before she crossed the line in 3min 52.15sec.</p>    <p>Hull, who had promised she would give it her all and try to win gold faded badly but clung on for bronze. Another Kenyan, Dorcus Ewoi, took silver. Now Kipyegon has a moouthwatering 5,000m clash of the titans to look forward to against the 10,000m world champion, Beatrice Chebet.</p> <p>“Being able to defend my title and to win a fourth gold feels really special,” said Kipyegon, who held four fingers up as she crossed the line. “This sport drives me. I need to push myself in order to be the best.</p> <p>It was another bad night for Britain with Matt Hudson-Smith, the Olympic and world silver medallist, going out of the men’s 400m at the semi-final stage, along with Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon. Reardon pointed to a long break outside the stadium as a factor in finishing last. </p> <p>“After the first 50m I just felt the tightening of my hamstring and pain,” he said. “You warm up to get yourself ready, and when you’re delayed for that long outside in the stadium, in the elements cooling down every second. It’s not really helpful.</p> <p>To make matters worse, World Athletics also reprimanded the British team after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with ‘100% Jesus’ on it during the semi-final of the 100m. The marketing of religious and political slogans is banned during competition by the governing body’s rules.</p> <p>“We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences,” read a World Athletics statement.</p> <p>It also emerged that a group of leading athletes will consider legal action if they are not paid by the end of the September for racing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/21/michael-johnson-grand-slam-track-misses-vital-village-fete-feel-athletics\">Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track</a>. Multiple athletes are still waiting on prize money after competing in the first three rounds, before the cancellation of the planned final event in Los Angeles. Johnson did not respond when approached for comment.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there was gold for New Zealand’s Hamish Kerr in the men’s high jump and for the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">Cordell Tinch in the 110m hurdles</a>, while there was better news for Britain in the men’s 800m as Ben Pattison and Max Burgin looked comfortable in qualifying for Thursday’s semi-finals.<br><br>Burgin, who won his heat in 1:44.73, looked comfortable until just after he gave an interview to the BBC and then threw up – something he often does after races. “Standard fare for me,” he said later, smiling.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jacob Bethell is ready for England to “chuck me in the deep end” as he prepares to lead the side for the first time against Ireland on Wednesday, making him the country’s youngest men’s captain.</p> \n<p>With Harry Brook rested for this quickfire three-match Twenty20 series in Malahide, just north of Dublin, the 21-year-old steps in to continue his brisk rise in international cricket. Bethell made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/11/travis-head-helps-blast-australia-to-t20-liftoff-against-inexperienced-england\">his England debut last September</a> and impressed in his first Test series against New Zealand at the end of the year. Yet to seal a regular place in the red-ball XI, he has become an automatic pick in Brendon McCullum’s white-ball teams.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">Ireland’s near-empty cricket summer in stark contrast to England’s slate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Baz gave me a ring and said I was going to be skipper,” said Bethell. “Not a whole lot has been said of why I’ve been chosen for the role. I don’t know the exact thinking of those who are in charge. I guess it’s maybe just a bit of trust, and showing a bit of faith. It will be nice to see how I go under pressure, and I’m sure that the guys that have made the decision would like to see that as well.</p> \n<p>“I like when things come at a fast pace, it tends to get me up and about. So I like those situations, doesn’t mean that they always work. But hopefully this one does.”</p> \n<p>Even with plenty of experienced names in the squad to face Ireland, Bethell’s ascension is in line with the management’s wilder impulses when it comes to selection. He will have to fall back on his previous experience of leading England Under-19s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e30692bd-17ee-4abf-bc7f-406957216e62\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ireland&nbsp;</b>Paul Stirling (capt), Ross Adair, Lorcan Tucker (wkt), Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Ben Calitz, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Barry McCarthy, Matthew Humphreys, Craig Young</p>\n    <p><b>England&nbsp;</b>Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wkt), Jordan Cox, Jacob Bethell (capt), Sam Curran, Tom Banton, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Adil Rashid, Luke Wood, Sonny Baker</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“A very young one,” replied a smiling Bethell when asked what type of captain he is. “The main thing I’ve looked up to in captains I’ve had previously is how they manage people. Not every tactical decision you make is going to work, but it’s managing the boys well so they feel you’re backing them. I’ve got no preconceived ideas of how I’m going to be.”</p> \n<p>Bethell has found form with the bat since he was announced as captain last month, having hit his first professional century in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">third ODI against South Africa</a> less than a fortnight ago. “I didn’t play for a while and maybe lost a little bit of rhythm, but felt that rhythm come back about midway through the Hundred so it’s great to be back feeling good.” He did not get dragged into any detailed Ashes talk: “My head’s firmly screwed on to this series.”</p> \n<p>Harry Tector and Paul Stirling “are the two main threats with the bat” for Ireland, said Bethell. The hosts enter underprepared having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">not played since June</a> – a completely different story to England – and will be without the whippy left-arm pace of Josh Little, on the mend from a rib injury. Yet the only completed T20 meeting between these two sides brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/ireland-stun-england-at-t20-world-cup-to-throw-super-12s-wide-open\">an Irish victory in Melbourne</a> at the World Cup three years ago, a reminder that it may not be all smooth for Bethell over the coming days.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the wake of the Trump administration’s announcement that it will overturn the rule which underpins virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee has launched an investigation into a suspected lobbying push that led to the move.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Senate environment and public works committee sent letters to two dozen corporations, including oil giants, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations. The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/31/trump-epa-endangerment-finding\">said in July</a> that it will unmake.</p> <p>The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/oil-donations-republicans-trump-anti-environment-bill\">Republicans who backed Trump’s anti-environment bill have accepted over $105m from big oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”</p> <p>Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.</p> <p>“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.</p> <p>It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.</p> <p>Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.</p> <p>The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched, and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.</p> <p>Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/climate/epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-proposal.html\">reported</a> that groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.</p> <p>When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.</p> <p>“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.</p> <p>Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.</p> <p>“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”</p> <p>Two environmental non-profits <a href=\"https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/0kdlw6oq5v8hsvj152eqx01b0qn74uuq.pdf\">have sued the Trump administration</a> for “secretly” convening a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/climate-science-trump-administration\">climate contrarians</a> to bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.</p> <p>The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/trump-air-climate-pollution-regulation-100-days\">war on the environment</a> by the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.</p> <p>“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.</p>",

government faces new questions about its response to last week’s Russian drones incursion</strong>, amid media reports that a house in the village of Wyryki damaged that night may have been hit not by a Russian drone, but by a missile launched from a Polish fighter jet sent to intercept it.</p> \n  <p>The report, first published by <a href=\"https://www.rp.pl/wojsko/art43015001-polska-rakieta-uderzyla-w-dom-na-lubelszczyznie\">Rzeczpospolita</a> daily and later confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetwiadomosci/to-rakieta-z-polskiego-f-16-zniszczyla-dom-w-wyrykach-prezydent-reaguje/kfjvs6b,79cfc278\">Onet</a>, included <strong>a suggestion that the missile’s targeting system malfunctioned on launch, but its in-built safety system prevented it from arming and exploding.</strong></p> \n  <p>Today’s media claims prompted <strong>the National Security Bureau, reporting to the opposition-aligned president Karol Nawrocki, to urge the government to “immediately clarify” what happened.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The government’s response focused on stressing Russia’s overall responsibility for the attack,</strong> which triggered the military reaction, without focusing on the details or confirming the reporting.</p> \n  <p>Poland’s <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> did not take questions from reporters when he appeared at a media briefing announcing plans on submarine procurement earlier today, but he responded to media reports on X, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the damage to the house in Wyryki falls on the authors of the drone provocation, that is, Russia.</strong> The appropriate services will inform the public, the government, and the president about all the circumstances of the incident after the proceedings are completed.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em><strong>“Hands off Polish soldiers.”</strong></em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>My definition of a Russian sockpuppet is someone who tries to remove responsibility from Russia</strong> for the consequences of the drone provocation against Poland.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy foreign minister <strong>Marcin Bosacki</strong>, who represented Poland at the UN security council meeting on the incident last week, said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the losses resulting from the Russian provocation of sending 19 military drones into Poland falls on Russia </strong>– whether the damage was caused by the drones or by the missiles intercepting them, used IN DEFENCE by Polish and allied armed forces.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The <strong>Polish ministry of defence issued only a brief statement saying that “the relevant state authorities are conducting a full investigation</strong> into the events following Russia’s aggression.”</p> \n  <p>“<strong>However, it is already clear today that Russia is responsible for the provocation and its consequences,</strong>” it said.</p> \n  <p>It later added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Regardless of the final conclusions of the state authorities, <strong>the destroyed house in the town of Wyryki will be rebuilt at the state’s expense.</strong>”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In its statement, <strong>the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/DowOperSZ/status/1967964049133428873\">sidestepped</a> the question about what happened, insisting instead that it provided the relevant authorities with “all available information, without any omissions.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c987448f080f2d1dcf1d06\"

programme “is unlikely to be achieved” with <strong>a “disconnect” between pledges made in Brussels and what happens on the ground.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Some 32 of the world’s 44 least developed countries (LDC) are in Africa</strong>, with Haiti, the only one categorised as such in the Caribbean are with eight countries in Asia including Cambodia and two in the Pacific classed as LDCs.</p> \n  <p>An in depth investigation by the court of auditors published today looked at <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Cambodia</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It found <strong>simple issues had arisen inhibiting its efficacy including training of public servants rather than business people.</strong><br><br>In Malawi, <strong>the EU found that a programme it had backed for farmers and small businesses was not backed by local banks involved.</strong> Instead they “only gave loans to big clients they had already worked with”.</p> \n  <p>Between 2017 and 2022 the EU and its member states allocated €17.2bn through the Aid for Trade programme to the world’s least developed countries, “a fraction of the overall €105.8bn sent to other developing countries”, the court of auditors said. </p> \n  <p>It also pointed out that the share received by the least developed countries declined from 18% of the Aid for Trade programme, to just 12% in 2022.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c97e8f8f080f2d1dcf1c91\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kiran-stacey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

defence.</strong></p> \n  <p>“We are not ready for either a Russian attack or an attack by another nation,” he added. “I’ve been saying this for a long time. <strong>I think it’s our job to put this

significantly increase defence spending over the next decade, even if the policy is extremely unpopular among Italians.</p> \n  <p><strong>In 2024, Italy’s defence spending was just 1.5% of output – at the lower end of the 32 Nato members.</strong> The country has committed to increasing this to 5% by 2035.

to do so.</strong></p> \n  <p>“<strong>If you’ve got drones that are putting Polish lives at risk, then Nato will take the action to take them out,</strong>” Healey said, adding the Typhoons were part of a broader mission “to defend Nato airspace”.</p> \n  <p><strong>Over the weekend, Romania became the second Nato ally in eastern Europe to detect a Russian drone crossing into its airspace in a week</strong> – and Healey said the Typhoons mission would extend operations to the country if deemed necessary.</p> \n  <p>He said: “They are deployed as part of the Nato Eastern Sentry air policing. <strong>What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato.</strong> That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”</p> \n  <p>There was <strong>no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate.</strong> </p> \n  <p>Healey said: “<strong>There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point.</strong> It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c92a828f084793c7c163a0\"

substance, the more reforms, and this is a point I made some times, the more we push [for] reforms, the more private capital will step up and the less public money we will need.”</p> \n  <p>“Of course, <strong>this path will break longstanding taboos, but the rest of the world has already broken theirs.</strong> For Europe’s survival, <strong>we must do what has not been done before</strong>, and refuse to be held back by self imposed limits,” he says.</p> \n  <p>He stresses the EU needs to “move beyond broad strategies and back-loaded timelines,” and need “concrete dates and deliverables.”</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“European citizens are <strong>asking that their leaders raise their eyes from their daily concerns</strong> towards their common European destiny

change elsewhere,' Draghi says as he urges EU to move faster on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, <strong>Mario Draghi – of the Draghi report – is speaking now</strong> and he is not exactly as positive as von der Leyen.</p> \n  <p>He talks about <strong>the need for the EU to move faster, be more agile, and match the pace of change elsewhere.</strong></p> \n  <p>He says that having his plan means that “Europe’s citizens and companies value the diagnosis, the clear priorities and the action plans, but they also express growing frustration” with the pace of change.</p> \n  <p><strong>“</strong>They are disappointed by how slowly the EU moves. <strong>They see us failing to match the speed of change elsewhere.</strong> They are ready to act, but fear governments have not grasped the gravity of the moment,<strong>”</strong> he says.</p> \n  <p>He adds that <strong>“too often, excuses are made for our slowness,”</strong> with some portraying it as the EU’s strength or respect for the rule of law.</p> \n  <p>“I think <strong>that’s complacency.</strong> Competitors in US and China are far less constrained even when acting within the law. <strong>To carry on as usual is to resign ourselves to falling behind,</strong>” he warns.</p> \n  <p>“<strong>A different path demands new speed, scale and intensity.</strong> It means acting together, not fragmenting our efforts. It means focusing resources where impact is greatest. It means delivering results within months, not years,” he argues.</p> \n  <p>On AI, he also strikes a more cautions tone, saying that it “depends on the orchestration of at least four other technologies” in cloud, supercomputing, cybersecurity and fibre satellites.</p> \n  <p>He says that Europe is falling behind the US and China on large foundation models, and sees lower AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>He stresses that “more ambition is needed” to “remove barriers to scaling up new technologies,” as he calls for more support from member states to move faster.</p> \n  <p>Draghi also takes about the AI Act being “another source of uncertainty,” suggesting that the next stage of codes of practice on high risk AI systems should be “paused until we better understand the drawbacks” as he called for “ex post” assessment to drive enforcement.</p> \n  <p>On industrial policies needed to respond to the rise of economic nationalism and protectionism, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“States are using every tool at their disposal to advance their interests. <strong>So far, Europe’s response has fallen into two traps, uncoordinated national efforts or blind faith that market force will build new structures.</strong> The first can never deliver scale. The second is impossible when others distort markets and tilt the level playing field.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><em>Ouch, ouch, ouch.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c919958f0807088ffe78cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:10:05.436Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU's von der Leyen praises bloc's progress on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As I mentioned earlier, <strong>the EU’s von der Leyen is speaking now in Brussels on “one year after the Draghi report.”</strong></p> \n  <p>Painting a rather rosy picture, she argues that <strong>Europe “is not only a challenger, but a leader in many fields that will define that race” on innovation,</strong> including computing power and AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>She insists that <strong>Europe “is not playing catch up”</strong> like it was during the rise of the Internet, but is “among the frontrunners.”</p> \n  <p>But on a slightly more critical tone, she says that <strong>Europe “needs to capitalise on our strengths”</strong> as she pointed out that the bloc’s “single market is far from being completed” and this needs to change to help companies grow.</p> \n  <p><strong>“It should not be easier to find a fortune across an ocean than across a European border, and we have started to address these barriers,”</strong> she says, stressing plans to progress reforms by 2028.</p> \n  <p>She also <strong>talks about the progress on cleaner energy</strong>, even as she admits that “our energy prices remain still far too high, too volatile, too disparate across Europe” with more to be done on interconnectors and grids across the continent.</p> \n  <p><strong>Von der Leyen also talks about the need to reduce Europe’s dependencies,</strong> particularly on China. “With the right policies, we can shore up our security,” she says.</p> \n  <p><em>I’ll keep monitoring her speech for key lines.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c918138f0807088ffe78c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:02:12.817Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 3,500 drones launched at Ukraine this month, Zelenskyy says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> <strong>Zelenskyy said that Russia has launched more than 3,500 drones and nearly 190 missiles against Ukraine so far this month.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>“There have also been provocations against our partners,”</strong> he said on X, refering to recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania.</p> \n  <p>“This is <strong>precisely the kind of aerial terror against which Ukraine is calling for joint defence</strong> – so that no one has to scramble combat aircraft in haste and feel Russia’s pressure on their borders.”</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Now is <strong>the time to implement the joint protection of our European skies</strong> with a multi-layered air defense system. </em></p> \n   <p><em>All the technologies for this are already in place.

    "description": "<p>Videos of frontman Ken Casey confronting rightwing provocateurs at the band’s gigs have gone viral, attracting new fans and new safety worries. He wants to lower the temperature – and see other bands speaking out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Backstage at the Rock la Cauze festival in Victoriaville, Canada, where Boston punk-rock institution Dropkick Murphys are headlining, founding bassist/singer Ken Casey is experiencing an uncharacteristic moment of anxiety.</p> <p>“We have concerns about going back over the border tonight,” he says, gravely – not for the illicit reasons touring musicians usually fear border crossings, but because Casey’s regular on stage rants against Donald Trump have gone viral. “We’re not worried about being arrested,” he adds. “But we have a show in New York tomorrow. Are we gonna get harassed or held up? We used to come over that border and they’d be, ‘Dropkicks! Come right through!’ But what’s it going to be like now?”</p> <p>By “now”, Casey means during the second Trump presidency, which has brought the political element always present within Dropkick Murphys’ bolshie, Pogues and Clash-influenced bruisers to the fore. The group’s resistance has found its sharpest expression at their shows, where their anthem <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=first+class+loser+dropkick+murphys&amp;oq=first+clas&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgoIARAuGLEDGIAEMgoIAhAAGLEDGIAEMgYIAxBFGDkyCggEEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBggHEEUYPdIBCDIxMTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:8c8bcc3d,vid:AjvNrF-v8AY,st:0\">First Class Loser</a> is accompanied by videos depicting Trump and former chum Jeffrey Epstein, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4ggwyWEMI\">Casey’s skirmishes with a vocal minority of Maga Dropkicks fans</a> in the mosh pit have lit up social media. He admits these fans often provoke the worst in him. “How do you know if someone’s in a cult? They hold up a hat all fuckin’ night,” he rages in one clip.</p> <p>“People tell me, ‘You didn’t use-ta soapbox like this’,” he says on our video call, gathering steam. “Well, we didn’t use-ta be in the midst of an authoritarian takeover!”</p> <p>Dropkick Murphys are still commanding big blue-collar crowds as they approach their 30th anniversary in 2026. Over the years they’ve scored numerous US Top 10 albums, Bruce Springsteen collaborations and a platinum-seller in the form of civic anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw\">I’m Shipping Up to Boston</a>, boosted by its appearance in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed. But their value system, Casey says, hasn’t changed since the now seven-strong band formed with the aim “to be a voice for working people”. Class and the labour movement are key to the 56-year-old’s identity. “My father died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandfather, a labour organiser who instilled in me the value of a union. In the Boston suburb where I was raised, everyone owed their lives to a union job. It put a roof over our head.”</p>    <p>The Boston of Casey’s youth was heavily Irish-American. “The English love to call us ‘plastic paddies’, but I’ve never thought of myself as Irish – I’m <em>Boston</em> Irish, the people that fought against the most Wasp-y, keep-the-Irish-down place that ever existed,” he says, referring to how Irish refugees fleeing the great famine of 19th-century were targeted by anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant groups and scorned by the English Protestant Puritans who had settled America. “To go from those trenches to positions of power in city hall, on the railroad and in the utility companies led to my generation being able to have the middle-class life.”</p> <p>He pauses for a second, but he’s not finished: Casey would make a great labour organiser himself. “When that’s your story, you need to be willing to aid the culture that’s coming next. One immigrant culture can’t close the door behind them, especially not in America. We’re all immigrants here.”</p> <p>A tearaway in his youth, Casey quit drink and drugs before he reached 21, “because otherwise I’d be in prison,” he says. “I had a big problem as a teen.” He ploughed his energies into the hardcore punk scene surrounding Boston venue the Rathskeller, AKA the Rat. “Punk-rock was the soundtrack to my friggin’ mayhem. I was a rebellious kid, I liked the underdog vibe.” In 1996, now booking shows at the Rat, a co-worker bet him $30 he “didn’t have the balls to start a band on three weeks’ notice”. Never one to back down from a wager, Casey formed Dropkick Murphys.</p> <p>His identity was stamped all over the group. Before they even used Celtic instrumentation – the Dropkicks are the rare punk band to field a bagpiper – he says the embryonic Dropkicks “sounded like [1960s Irish folk group] the Clancy Brothers meets the Ramones – the delivery, the melodies, the lyrical content. It just naturally poured out of me.”</p> <p>Their beginnings were hardscrabble: pressing their own singles, booking their own shows and touring in an old Boston transit bus, for reasons of poverty and pride. “We peeled the roof off under a low bypass,” he grins. “We toured for two more years with that roof open like a convertible. When it rained, I held an umbrella over the driver.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d8SzG4FPyM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9d8SzG4FPyM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Dropkick Murphys: Rose Tattoo – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>By the 21st century, they had become staples of the US punk-rock circuit, their annual St Patrick’s Day shows among Boston’s hottest tickets, performing and recording with their heroes. “We play Billy Bragg’s There Is Power in a Union over the PA every night before we go on stage,” Casey says. “He opened our St Patrick’s show last year with it and then played Worker’s Song with us. Afterwards, he said, ‘I felt like I was in the fuckin’ Clash for three minutes!’” Springsteen, another member of the Dropkicks’ extended family, recorded their Rose Tattoo for a charity single after the Boston Marathon bombing, and sang Peg O’ My Heart with Dropkicks in Boston, “back when my grandmother Peg was still alive”, says Casey. “He came on with her for the encore – we had to pry her off Bruce’s arm to get her off the stage. I’m almost shocked a guy of that level was so down-to-earth. But he’s always had an affinity with punk. Bruce still walks the talk.”</p> <p>“Walking the talk” matters to the Dropkicks; their merch is made in the US by union-approved manufacturers, while their <a href=\"https://www.claddaghfund.org/\">Claddagh Fund</a> supports non-profit organisations across Boston. “We were pretty beloved in our city, whether people liked our music or not, because we gave a lot back to the community,” Casey says. Not any more, however. “Now a lot of people in my circles say ‘Fuck Dropkick Murphys’,” he adds, lantern jaw clenching. “Although never to my face. They despise me and the band.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s clear that, for Casey, the political is personal. His sense of betrayal regarding “the many rank-and-file union members who are now Trump voters” is palpable. “They don’t think Trump’s coming for the unions, but he’s coming for the unions, trust me. I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. It’s about total control for the rich. It’s class war.”</p> <p>What is the magic spell Trump has managed to cast over a demographic who were until recently, Casey says, “in lockstep with Dropkicks’ beliefs”? “Trump offered them a chance to say out loud things people used to have to whisper to their friends,” Casey spits. “Racism, cruelty, jokes about disabilities. A lot of white people in America believed whites will not be in control any more, especially after Obama. This is their last, desperate grasp to hold control.”</p> <p>The Dropkicks have met this grim moment with records that have transformed their previously cartoonish riot music into something more sober, biting and heartfelt. Two acoustic albums – 2022’s This Machine Still Kills Fascists and 2023’s Okemah Rising – set unrecorded Woody Guthrie polemics to their music. “Woody’s grandson Cole told his mom Nora, ‘Grandpa would’ve liked these guys’,” Casey beams proudly. “It made us better musicians, doing it all acoustic. But that left us with a hunger to go electric and be a punk-rock band again.” Which brings us to this year’s <a href=\"https://www.kerrang.com/album-review-dropkick-murphys-for-the-people\">For the People</a>, which opens with Who’ll Stand With Us? A key lyric: “The working people fuel the engine / While you yank the chain.”</p>    <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrxVX3iNvhY\">viral clip from a recent show</a>, Casey bets a fan in a Maga shirt $100 that it wasn’t manufactured in the US; it was, inevitably, manufactured in Nicaragua, and Casey swapped the offending garment for a union-made Dropkicks T-shirt.</p> <p>“If America is ever going to go back to some semblance of normal, we have to bring the temperature down, we need to be able to talk to each other,” Casey says, referencing that night. “I talked to that guy afterwards, and he said, ‘I don’t let politics get in the way of family, and I consider you family’. I could have jumped down his throat, but he seemed open to reason.” He pauses. “That’s rare for Maga, though. Other days, I’m like, ‘Fuck this, I don’t even want to know these people, if this is how they think and behave’. Do I want to have a dialogue with these people? No. I’m just hoping the fever will break. I don’t need them to have a ‘come to Jesus’ moment on the difference between right and wrong – I just need them not to support what’s happening.”</p> <p>Does he fear blowback for his outspokenness, like that suffered by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/-late-show-stephen-colbert-wins-emmy-cbs-cancellation-rcna231276\">Stephen Colbert</a> – or worse?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/21/deftones-singer-chino-moreno-ive-got-hundreds-of-drawings-of-myself-in-my-house\">Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unlike Stephen, we have no parent company, so we can say what we want,” he says. “Regarding our safety … whatever,” he snarls, disdainfully. “I’ll never have a security guard or anything like that. But you gotta keep your head on a swivel a little bit. Back in the day, we always had a Nazi element gunning for us, but you could see them coming. Now you don’t know who’s who. I’m not sure what’s keeping other people quiet, though, especially in punk-rock. Where’d everyone go? They had the balls to speak out against Bush back in the day. But Bush didn’t have an army of trolls that come after you. Speaking out against Bush wasn’t going to cost you half your fanbase, potentially.”</p> <p>In his darker moments, Casey reckons “within a year, this country’s gonna fall on its face, and people are gonna feel the pain: recession, inflation, unemployment. There’s nobody coming to save us.” He says he feels “no excitement or happiness” in the group’s anti-Trump screeds winning them newfound fame. “But maybe there’s a slight sense of validation,” he adds. “I talk to the fans every night. One night, an immigrant told me, ‘I moved here, and my partner is American, we have children, and I live in fear of being deported. My own friends have turned on me, they say I’m taking American jobs.’ He was actually in tears at the end. But he said, ‘I feel like someone is speaking on my behalf’. From the earliest days of this band, we wanted to be involved in something that mattered. So we are. I wish it was a different subject and not quite so important, but …”</p> <p>He sighs. Maybe the border tonight will be a shitshow, but it won’t change how the Dropkicks operate in this darkest of moments. “We’re sticking our neck out and getting a lot of negative attention,” he adds. “But if we don’t do it now, it might be too late.”</p> <p>• For the People is out now on Dummy Luck Music/PIAS. <a href=\"https://dropkickmurphys.com/tour/\">Dropkick Murphys’ European tour</a> begins 15 October at Alcatraz, Milan</p>",

    "description": "<p>‘Sobering and concerning’ that Axel Rudakubana had searched X for Australia knife attack, inquiry told</p>",
    "content": "<p>A lawyer said it was “sobering and concerning” that the Southport attacker probably viewed footage on social media of a stabbing in Australia by a teenage boy just 40 minutes before carrying out his own crimes.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.southport.public-inquiry.uk/\">inquiry is being held</a> into the circumstances and events leading up to the attack by Axel Rudakubana, then 17, on 29 July 2024 in which he murdered three young girls and attempted to murder eight children and two adults.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the inquiry, outlined what would be explored and the questions that would be asked during the course of the inquiry, being held at Liverpool town hall.</p> <p>Moss said a notable feature of the “extremely cowardly” attack was that it was “specifically targeting women and girls”.</p> <p>He said the inquiry would establish a timeline of Rudakubana’s history and “interactions with various state systems including criminal justice, education, social care and healthcare”.</p> <p>Questions will also be asked of Rudakubana’s parents and of the social media companies Meta and X.</p> <p>Moss referred to Rudakubana as AR throughout his submission, and described him as a “prolific internet user”.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that the teenager had deleted his browsing history on his laptop before carrying out his crimes. But evidence showed he used another tablet to search on X for a knife attack by a teenage boy on a bishop in Australia.</p>    <p>The search led him to posts on X likely to have shown the actual act of stabbing, Moss said.</p> <p>“The inquiry has made a statement request of X about the fact that the act of a stabbing would have been viewable on its platform apparently to a 17-year-old boy,” he said.</p> <p>“It might, perhaps, be thought to be both sobering and concerning, in terms of online harms, that almost the last thing AR did before committing these dreadful crimes was to search for, and possibly view, material on Twitter in relation to a stabbing carried out by another boy aged under 18.”</p> <p>Moss said Meta, which owns Instagram, and X had been asked for “information about AR’s use of their platforms and we await their substantive responses”.</p> <p>Rudakubana travelled by taxi from his home in Banks to a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance class for children in Southport, where he committed his crimes. The inquiry was shown the pink-coloured advert for the class, which was “bound to appeal more to girls than boys”, Moss said.</p> <p>Apart from one man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/man-stabbed-tackling-southport-killer-scene-horror-jonathan-hayes\">injured in the attack</a>, it was a “notable feature” that all the other victims were female, he continued.</p> <p>The killer was jailed for life with a minimum term of 52 years in January at Liverpool crown court, after admitting the murders and attempted murders, described in court as “sadistic”.</p> <p>One part of the inquiry will be Rudakubana’s internet use and purchase of weapons, posing as an adult and using a false name. Moss said: “AR’s purchase of weapons is important because it will highlight vulnerabilities in the law against the purchase of knives, crossbows and machetes.”</p> <p>Rudakubana also bought seeds through Amazon, which he used to make a “crude preparation of ricin”, Moss said.</p> <p>He said the inquiry had requested detailed statements from Rudakubana’s parents “and will seek to explore their awareness of AR’s online orders and the items that AR stored in his bedroom and the living room of their home”.</p> <p>A central theme of the inquiry would be which bodies or agencies “took ownership” for intervening to address the risks that Rudakubana had demonstrated in his behaviour before the crimes.</p> <p>Before Moss spoke, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Adrian Fulford, promised to do everything “humanly possible” to answer the questions of bereaved families and victims.</p> <p>On Monday, the inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/southport-attack-inquiry-hears-parents-memories-of-their-daughters\">heard harrowing testimony</a> from the parents of the three murdered girls – Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.</p> <p>Impact evidence has also been heard from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/girl-saved-sisters-life-by-shielding-her-from-southport-attacker-inquiry-hears\">families of the other children</a> present on the day and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-dance-teachers\">injured adults</a>.</p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The claim is central to rationales for arming Israel even as leading human rights groups decry genocide in Gaza</p>",
    "content": "<p>More than nine months after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza\">Human Rights Watch</a> issued reports that concluded Israel was committing genocide – and more than a month since key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/28/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-say-israel-based-human-rights-groups\">Israeli human rights groups asserted</a> the same – the American political establishment remains in rigid denial while horrors continue nonstop in Gaza. Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats in Congress still support massive US arms shipments to Israel, so they certainly can’t admit that the weaponry is making genocide possible.</p> <p>Central to rationales for arming Israel is the claim that it is the nation of “the Jewish people”.</p> <p>When the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke via video to a conference in Jerusalem three months ago, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=gw27xba40xE\">declared</a>: “There can be no nuanced separation of hatred of Israel and hatred of the Jewish people.” Rubio added: “Those who call for the destruction of Israel are calling for the destruction of the Jewish people.” Last month, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, reinforced the same message while visiting Israel, where he reportedly <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-08-04/ty-article/.premium/u-s-house-speaker-says-west-bank-rightful-property-of-jewish-people-at-settler-confab/00000198-7541-d3a7-af9e-776713fe0000\">said</a> that the West Bank is “the rightful property of the Jewish people”.</p> <p>Such rhetoric – equating Israel with all Jews and Israel’s future with theirs – is an effort to sanctify Israel and shield it from criticism by brandishing the charge of antisemitism.</p> <p>Fusing Israel with “the Jewish people” is a key propaganda technique. The fact that it’s so ubiquitous makes it no less ridiculous, or dangerous. A comment attributed to Voltaire applies: “As long as people believe in absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities.”</p> <p>And atrocities continue with no end in sight. Israel <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-182-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem\">has persisted</a> with methodical – and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/01/gaza-israeli-killings-of-palestinians-seeking-food-are-war-crimes\">clearly intentional</a> – killing of Palestinian civilians not only with bombs, missiles and bullets but also with <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israels-use-starvation-weapon-war-has-pushed-gaza-breaking-point\">starvation as a weapon of war</a>. Blockage or <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/september/israels-siege-now-blocks-83-of-food-aid-reaching-gaza-new-data-reveals\">extreme constriction</a> of humanitarian aid has been the norm. All summer, Israel has ignored the United Nations <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164076\">warning</a> issued in June that food intake in Gaza had dropped far below “survival” level. By then, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq0gy82wjo\">said</a> conditions there had become worse than “hell on earth”.</p> <p>Ironically, the country that we’re told is the ultimate target of antisemitism is now, in reality, the world’s most powerful <em>cause </em>of antisemitism. By insisting that it is the embodiment of Jews all over the world, the state of Israel seeks to associate Jews everywhere with its systematic <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-ehud-olmert-thinks-his-country-is-committing-war-crimes\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/opinion/israel-gaza-holocaust-genocide-palestinians.html\">genocide</a> in Gaza along with <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/attacks-on-palestinians-intensifying-in-occupied-west-bank-un-rights\">deadly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-ethnic-cleansing-forced-displacements-gaza-human-rights-watch-rcna180098\">ethnic cleansing</a> of Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/03/tragedy-foretold-and-stain-our-collective-humanity-special-rapporteur-warns\">in the West Bank</a>.</p> <p>The Israeli government, esteemed by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n90g6v9qo\">dwindling number</a> of Americans, conflates itself with Judaism and “the Jewish people” in a marketing pattern so familiar that it blends into the wallpaper of media echo chambers. The crux of pro-Israel messaging is to promote a set of false equations: Israel = Jews. Support for Israel = support for Jews. Denunciations of Israel = antisemitism. And a functional subtext of those equations is this one: Israeli government = impunity.</p> <p>During the 1980s, when activists in the United States and elsewhere targeted apartheid South Africa with non-violent campaigns for boycotts, divestment and sanctions, those actions did not provoke charges of being anti-white. In this century, the nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has targeted Israel, a country condemned as an apartheid state by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution\">one</a> human rights organization after <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid\">another</a> after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/\">another</a> – and BDS supporters, even if Jewish, routinely face accusations of antisemitism. In Congress, the accusers include many liberal Democrats. The American Jewish Committee is one of many sizable groups that have long been <a href=\"https://www.ajc.org/news/bds-is-antisemitic\">flatly declaring</a> that “BDS is antisemitic”.</p> <p>Six decades ago, as a child going to Hebrew school, I couldn’t have imagined that the Jewish faith and reverence for Israel would become so manipulated. When I asked neighbors to put coins into a blue-and-white can so more trees could be planted in Israel, little did I know that the Israeli government would relentlessly kill, maim and terrorize Palestinian civilians in the name of protecting Jews. Nor did I have any inkling that the dignity and spirituality of Judaism would be twisted and desecrated by Israel with policies of genocide.</p> <p>One of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/\">Basic Laws</a>, enacted in 2018, says: “the State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people,” adding: “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” This is codification of standard assertions from the Israeli government and its ardent boosters doing all they can to hijack Judaism – claiming to speak for the world’s Jews, whether they like it or not.</p> <p>Increasingly, they don’t. <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-american-jews-are-turning-away-israel\">Polling</a> shows <a href=\"https://jcpa.org/survey-among-american-jews-over-51-support-for-bidens-decision-to-withhold-arms-shipments-to-israel/\">major opposition</a> to core Israeli policies among Jewish people in the US.</p> <p>All too often, US government officials amplify the senseless trope that Israel is the guarantor of safety for Jews worldwide. Speaking at a Hanukkah party at the White House in December 2023, former president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/user-clip-were-there-no-israel-there-wouldnt-be-a-jew-in-the-world-that-is-safe/5097513\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, there wouldn’t be a Jew in the world that is safe.” The remarkable assertion, which met with loud applause and cheers, was hardly a one-off. Three months earlier, Biden had <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-roundtable-discussion-with-jewish-community-leaders\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It’s the only ultimate guarantee.”</p> <p>The US Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, writes in his new book Antisemitism in America: “There is a special and almost indescribable pride that comes from knowing, despite all the horrors, that after two millennia of wandering the desert, the Jewish people would finally return home.” It’s a classic conceit of claiming to speak for “the Jewish people” and insisting that Israel is their actual homeland – no matter where they live on the planet.</p> <p>The biggest Jewish organizations in the US automatically extol the Israeli government, regardless of what it does. And, as Peter Beinart <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/opinion/israel-state-jewish.html\">wrote</a> this year: “American Jewish leaders don’t just insist on Israel’s right to exist. They insist on its right to exist as a Jewish state. They cling to the idea that it can be both Jewish and democratic despite the basic contradiction between legal supremacy for one ethno-religious group and the democratic principle of equality under the law.”</p> <p>More insidious is the unspoken assumption that, after all is said and done, Jewish lives are intrinsically much more valuable than other lives in general and Palestinian lives in particular, while Israel’s destiny is transcendent. It’s a mindset that Beinart decries in his new book Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: “No matter how many Palestinians die, they do not tip the scales, because the value of a Palestinian is finite and the value of a Jewish state is infinite … Worshipping a country that elevates Jews over Palestinians replaces Judaism’s universal God – who makes special demands on Jews but cherishes all people – with a tribal deity that considers Jewish life precious and Palestinian life cheap.”</p> <p>Such worshipping of Israel fuels the pernicious concept that “the Jewish people” are synonymous with Israel. Any such claim can only be destructive, especially with Israel shamelessly engaged in ethnic cleansing, mass murder and genocide.</p> <ul> <li><p>Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

He was also booked in connection with images on his cellphone depicting child abuse, said state authorities, who took Zinn into custody after he was released from a hospital that was treating him for a medical condition.</p> <p>Documents filed in Zinn’s case by UVU campus police allege that he began screaming, “I shot him – now shoot me,” in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s killing at Utah Valley University (UVU) on 10 September. Video of officers holding Zinn down was widely circulated online, leading some to believe that authorities had quickly arrested a suspect in the killing of the conservative political activist.</p> <p>Then, when asked by an officer where the gun used to kill Kirk was, Zinn allegedly replied: “I am not going to tell you.” Police contend that Zinn subsequently admitted that he was not the shooter and did not know who was – and he purportedly claimed that he had acted how he did to draw attention away from the real killer in hopes of becoming “a martyr” for Kirk.</p> <p>Zinn was later brought to a hospital and told officers he was “glad he said he shot the individual so the real suspect could get away”, according to police documents.</p> <p>He allegedly was reluctant to let investigators look at his phone, saying he used the device “to look at child sexual abuse material”, local sheriff’s deputies wrote in a separate report, as the Utah news outlet <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/51373320/man-claimed-to-shoot-charlie-kirk-to-draw-attention-from-the-real-shooter-police-say\">KSL</a> noted. A search of Zinn’s phone allegedly confirmed there were more than 20 images depicting child abuse, including of minors believed to be about 5 years old – as well as explicit messages about sexual acts.</p> <p>Ultimately, authorities arrested Zinn on counts of obstruction of justice linked to the aftermath of Kirk’s killing and sexual exploitation of a minor for the alleged content on his phone.</p> <p>Police announced the arrest of Kirk’s actual suspected killer on Friday after a two-day manhunt. He has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, of Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles south of UVU.</p> <p>Zinn has a history of criminal charges and convictions in Utah over the previous three decades,<a href=\"https://ksltv.com/local-news/utah-man-who-falsely-claimed-he-shot-charlie-kirk-booked-into-jail/819948/\"> according to KSL</a> and other local media reports. Notably, in 2013, he was arrested on allegations that he asked Salt Lake City, Utah, marathon organizers if he could help set up bombs at the finish line.</p> <p>The deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds of others had been days earlier.</p> <p>Citing information from a district attorney whose office had previously prosecuted him, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Zinn was “politically conservative, leaning libertarian”.</p> <p>On Monday, a judge ordered Zinn be held without bail, according to online court records. Robinson is expected in court Tuesday to face formal murder charges.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/young-climate-activists-lawsuit-trump-fossil-fuels",
    "description": "<p>Group of activists, who range in age from seven to 25, include plaintiffs who won landmark climate case in Montana two years ago</p>",
    "content": "<p>Youth climate activists are taking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> to court this week over its anti-environment agenda.</p> <p>In a two-day hearing in Missoula, Montana, starting Tuesday, the young activists, who are between seven and 25, will argue that a federal judge should block three of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump’s</a> pro-fossil fuel executive orders.</p> <p>The hearing, which follows the filing of litigation in May, will mark the first time a federal court hears live testimony in a youth-led constitutional climate case.</p> <p>The lawsuit specifically targets executive orders declaring a “national energy emergency” and aiming to “unleash American energy”, and another April order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the most polluting and costliest fossil fuel. Those actions, they will say, constitute unlawful executive overreach and violate the state-created danger doctrine, a legal principle meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens.</p> <p>“At a time when we need to reduce fossil fuel reliance, the federal government is actively setting us back with these executive orders designed to unleash fossil fuels,” Georgi Fischer, a plaintiff in the case, told the Guardian. “It’s incredibly important for us to fight back against these unconstitutional attacks on our rights to life and liberty.”</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment, as well as the six agencies named as defendants. Alyse Sharpe, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, said: “We don’t comment on litigation.”</p> <p>The litigation was filed by non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order\">notched a landmark win</a> in the lawsuit Held v Montana, when a judge ruled that Montana’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated a group of youth plaintiffs’ rights under the state’s constitution. Some plaintiffs in the new federal litigation, including Fischer, were also challengers in the Montana case.</p> <p>“If the Held v Montana case taught me anything, it’s that our voices and stories can be incredibly powerful and so I’m hoping the court listens to us and understands how our lives and our futures are being harmed by these unconstitutional executive orders,” Fischer said.</p> <p>During the hearing this week, some of the plaintiffs will speak. They will be joined on the stand by five expert witnesses and six fact witnesses, including Columbia environmental economist Geoffrey Heal, Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor Mark Jacobson, global ecology expert Steven Running, and John Podesta, former White House senior advisor on clean energy under Joe Biden.</p> <p>“I’m proud to speak on behalf of these young plaintiffs about the devastating impact of these executive orders,” Podesta said in a statement. “The plaintiffs make a compelling case that these orders will only make the climate crisis worse, putting at risk the health, safety, and economic well-being of these young people as well as their families and communities.”</p> <p>The federal government will not call any witnesses.</p> <p>Last month, the federal government moved to dismiss the youth plaintiffs’ case. In an unusual move, Montana and a coalition of 18 other states plus Guam also called for <a href=\"https://www.publicjustice.net/states-guam-intervene-climate-lawsuit-trump-adminstration-fossil-fuels-executive-orders/\">the lawsuit’s dismissal.</a></p> <p>The lawsuit could face an uphill battle in court. A previous federal climate lawsuit filed by Our Children’s Trust ended in a denial from the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032425zor_q8l1.pdf?ref=climateinthecourts.com\">supreme court this year</a> after being filed a decade earlier.</p> <p>“These are always uphill battles, especially under a Trump administration determined to tilt the scales toward fossil fuels, but the constitution is clear: no president can sacrifice children’s rights and futures to prop up one industry,” said Mat dos Santos, Our Children’s Trust’s general counsel. “A victory would mean that even presidential power has limits, especially when children’s lives, health, and futures are at stake.”</p>",

I’ve worked so hard for it this year so I was able to hold on in that last 20m or so.”</p> <p>Like she did in her semi-final, Hull started the race behind the pack.

Reece Holder also had a valiant showing in the men’s 400m, finishing third in his semifinal but not quite delivering one of the two next fastest times that would have booked him a place in the final.</p> <p>After four days of competition, Australia has won two medals, both bronze, and sit 22nd in the medal tally. Victory in the men’s high jump by Olympic champion Hamish Kerr gave New Zealand their second gold, and their 14-strong team is now fourth in the medal tally behind only the United States, Kenya and Canada.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/nicholas-grimshaws-architecture-eden-project",
    "description": "<p>As well as the Eden Project, Grimshaw’s ambitious and audacious work on railway stations, airports, sports complexes and supermarkets could elevate even the most mundane experience</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/eden-project-architect-nicholas-grimshaw-dies-aged-85\">Eden Project architect Nicholas Grimshaw dies aged 85 – news</a> <br></p>",
    "content": "<p>‘I asked for the eighth wonder of the world and I got it,” declared Tim Smit, co-founder of the Eden Project designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, who has died at 85. In a Cornish china clay quarry, a cluster of geodesic domes resembling monumental soap bubbles enclose conservatories housing luxuriant plant eco-systems. Completed in 2000, it was one of Grimshaw’s most ambitious and audacious projects, seemingly springing from the mind of a science fiction novelist rather than an architect.</p> <p>But however thrillingly futuristic Grimshaw’s buildings appeared, they were grounded by an avid interest in engineering and craft, and how historic precedents could be transformed and adapted for the modern era. Instead of using glass for the Eden Project’s domes, Grimshaw employed gossamer-light foil cushions.</p> <p>When passenger rail services through the Channel tunnel first began operating in 1994, the British end was marked by a new international terminus at London’s Waterloo Station. Grimshaw conjured a radical reimagining of the Victorian iron and glass train shed that his 19th-century predecessors would immediately recognise. The inspiration for the roof’s asymmetrical arched form, a design feat made all the more complex by being curved on plan, was the skeleton of a human hand. Intricately pin-jointed to accommodate the deflection imposed by trains, a glazed roof vault encased platforms in a delicately transparent cocoon. Underneath, a sleek, airport-style concourse whisked passengers up to the platform.</p>    <p>Though it endured a forlorn period after Eurostar switched its operations to St Pancras in 2007, it has since been incorporated back into the main station as part of a major refurbishment, so that commuters heading for the home counties can experience the same frisson as those original Paris-bound adventurers.</p> <p>Hi-tech architecture was often calculated to appear at its best in a mechanistic, depopulated state, but Grimshaw’s output of stations, airports, trade fair halls, sports complexes and even the odd supermarket, civilised and elevated the everyday experience of catching a train or going shopping.</p>    <p>Part aircraft carrier, part aircraft hangar, Sainsbury’s Camden superstore (1988) was a muscular, metallic armature that brought a touch of Mad Max to the weekly shop. Grimshaw even designed a new kind of ramped travelator that locked on to shopping trolleys to convey customers down to the basement car park. It was characteristic of his attention to detail and confidence in technology to solve the most quotidian of problems.</p> <p>Early standout projects included Oxford Ice Rink (1984), a daring, column-free structure suspended by a cat’s cradle of cables from two towering masts and clad in silver panels more commonly used in cold stores. The Financial Times print works (1988) invigorated a bleak part of London’s terraforming Docklands by putting the<strong> </strong><em>ballet mécanique</em> of newspaper production on public view inside an immaculately engineered glass box. Passersby could watch the FT emerge each day in a Heath Robinson-style tableau of whirring machinery and pink newsprint.</p>    <p>Commissioned to design the British Pavilion for the 1992 Seville Expo, Grimshaw devised an elegant, modular structure topped by a rippling cockscomb of solar panels. These provided the energy to power a wall of water which cooled the pavilion and its visitors in Seville’s searing summer heat. The headquarters for the Western Morning News (1993) was conceived as a futuristic galleon in full sail on a hillside outside Plymouth, while in Berlin, the Ludwig Erhard Haus (1998), designed to house the reunified city’s Chamber of Commerce, was suspended from a ribcage of parabolic steel arches, hoisted into position as theatrically as the timber frames of a medieval barn.</p> <p>Railway stations were a recurring theme. After the success of Waterloo, Grimshaw went on to revitalise London’s Paddington (1999), stripping away accumulated accretions to reveal the engineering puissance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Latterly, towards the end of his career, his firm was given the herculean task of sorting out London Bridge, once described by John Betjeman as “the most complicated, muddled and unwelcoming of all London termini”. Where there was dinginess and disorder there is now clarity and connection, expressed in a cavernous new concourse and a concerto of escalators and lifts. Even Betjeman might be able to find his way around.</p>    <p>Another much larger London infrastructure project, the Elizabeth Line, won last year’s RIBA Stirling prize, shared with design team collaborators Maynard, Equation and AtkinsRéalis. “Descending into the colossal network of tunnels feels like entering a portal to the future, where the typical commuter chaos is transformed into an effortless experience,” said RIBA president Muyiwa Oki.</p> <p>Grimshaw was always keen to point out that technology evolves and circumstances change, but the trick is to produce architecture that is agile and adaptable. This was perhaps most persuasively demonstrated by the successful 2019 remodelling of the Herman Miller furniture factory to house the Bath Schools of Art and Design. Originally completed in 1976, when Grimshaw was in partnership with Terry Farrell, the archetypal slick industrial shed is now another kind of factory, an incubator for the processes of creation, making, experimentation and learning, showing that buildings could – and should – have second lives.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Giddy romantic fantasy sends its two commitment-phobe leads on a magical road trip through their pasts that may lead them back to love</p>",
    "content": "<p>Korean-American auteur <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3226379/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1\">Kogonada</a> has until now been known for his intriguingly complex, cerebral essayistic movies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/05/columbus-review-kogonada-john-cho\">Columbus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/21/after-yang-review-what-to-do-when-your-ai-robot-child-goes-wrong\">After Yang</a>, whose emotional content, though potent, isn’t immediately obvious. Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars. This is a musical without musical numbers (without its own musical numbers, anyway) and a romantic comedy mostly without comedy – an imbalance it shares with most romcoms in fact. The screenwriter is Seth Reiss, co-author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/the-menu-review-ralph-fiennes-celeb-chef-horror-comedy-cooks-nasty-surprises\">the (much chillier) drama The Menu</a>, with Ralph Fiennes as a scary chef.</p> <p>What Kogonada and Reiss are offering is a likably, if obtusely uncynical, heart-on-sleeve wish-fulfilment spectacular, which gradually retreats from its initial, borderline insufferable self-awareness. Or maybe it’s just that you get used to it. We are plunged into a woozy daydream as multicoloured as a ball pit in a kids’ play centre, all about love, relationships and the overwhelming importance of being open and risking emotional hurt to find the One. This involves coming to terms with your past and how you feel about your passionately remembered parents who are either dead or at any rate don’t tactlessly appear on screen in their present elderly form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoRfTjfh91o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YoRfTjfh91o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell play Sarah and David, two mind-blowingly attractive single professionals who meet and warily flirt at the wedding of mutual friends; when Sarah’s rental car breaks down afterwards, they wind up sharing David’s and go on a road trip together away from unhappy commitment-phobia and towards self-forgiveness and love.</p> <p>But that’s not the half of it. The rental car agency, run by two uber-zany comedy characters played by Kevin Kline and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (the latter dropping F-bombs and doing a wacky German accent that she snaps out of while musing on how we all perform roles), has given David a special 90s vintage Saturn with its own mystical GPS which guides the couple to various magic doors in the landscape. They go through these to primal scenes of their past: to encounters with their respective parents, to a Canadian lighthouse where David once epiphanically realised he wasn’t having an epiphany, to a modern art gallery which Sarah’s late mother loved in her too-good-to-be-true way and which they now visit (for some reason) in the pitch darkness with a torch, to two separate hospitals which might somehow be the same hospital, and to David’s high school where he fell unrequitedly in love with his leading lady while performing in their Broadway-level production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, in the film’s best scene.</p> <p>Kogonada’s previous film After Yang had distinct touches of Charlie Kaufman in its futurist drama about a family who have an intense emotional connection with the secondhand AI humanoid robot they buy as a companion-sibling for their adopted daughter. And this film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well … or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge’s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no.</p> <p>When recognisably real things happen they stand out very sharply. Sarah, on a capricious whim at the wedding, asks David to marry her and, after a moment in which you think David is going to take her up on it, to indulge this fantasy, he appears to think better of it and instead says coldly: “You’ve destroyed some men, haven’t you …” And when Sarah and David arrive at David’s high school and Sarah realises everyone thinks David is the teenager he was then, she asks his drama teacher how old he thinks she is, and he replies “40” – an outrageously ungallant estimate which infuriates her. But there is also sweetness and charm, not disenchantment, in the breath-holding competition to which Sarah challenges David in the car – a game her mother liked.</p> <p>The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.</p> <p>• A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is out on 18 September in Australia, and on 19 September in the UK and US.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It doesn’t have to be miserable. We asked experts how best to start training your new (or old) best friend</p>",
    "content": "<p>My family has never been closer to the brink of collapse than when we got a puppy. We spent hours reading articles and watching videos about puppy training, and were constantly arguing about the right way to potty train him or get him to stop barking.</p> <p>Every new piece of information seemed to contradict what we’d already learned – never scold him! Scold him! – but one thing was certain: make one wrong move and you will ruin your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/dogs\">dog</a> and your life forever.</p> <p>We had fallen into a common trap.</p> <p>“The No 1 mistake people make [when training] is thinking, I have to make my dog be perfect and sit all the time, instead of remembering why we got a dog and that we’re meant to have fun together,” says Amanda Gagnon, a zoologist, behavior consultant and dog trainer in New York City.</p> <p>Training is how a dog and a human learn to communicate with each other and build a relationship, says Gagnon. This is essential to a dog’s safety and happiness, but it doesn’t need to be a joyless chore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/28/its-all-about-tone-of-voice-three-dog-trainers-on-how-to-beat-behavioural-problems\">‘It’s all about tone of voice’: three dog trainers on how to beat behavioural problems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We talked to experts about how to start training your dog – in a way that won’t make you lose your mind.</p> <h2>Manage expectations</h2> <p>Between social media, Lassie reruns and basic perfectionism, humans can sometimes have unrealistic standards for dogs.</p> <p>“A lot of people get stuck on the Instagram-perfect dog that is always happy and never has negative emotions,” says Alex Sessa, the owner and head trainer of Peach on a Leash in Atlanta.</p> <p>But dogs are individuals with different personalities and needs. Maybe you wanted a dog that accompanies you to the farmer’s market every Saturday, but crowds make your dog feel stressed.</p> <p>That’s not a problem, says Sessa – people just need to adjust their expectations accordingly. “That’s still a great dog. There’s nothing wrong with the dog that doesn’t want to go everywhere with us,” she says.</p> <p>And expecting your dog to always be perfectly calm can lead to greater behavioral trouble down the road, says Gagnon.</p> <p>“When we don’t give our dogs outlets to express themselves as dogs – meaning barking and running and being bananas in general – those needs get suppressed, and when that happens, it’s like a powder keg that’s going to explode at any moment,” she says.</p> <h2>Give them time to settle in</h2> <p>Whether you’re bringing home a puppy or an adult dog, experts agree it is important to give them plenty of time to acclimate.</p> <p>“Don’t jump into too much obedience right away,” Sessa says. “We don’t want the dog to immediately feel like we’re barking commands at them and asking them to do a million things.”</p> <p>Adult dogs in particular can take up to three months to settle into a new home and show their true behavior pattern, says Ciera Moberg, a certified dog behavior consultant and co-founder of Instinct Dog Behavior &amp; Training in Washington DC. The way your dog acts the first day you bring them home might be completely different than the way they act on day 30.</p> <p>Once your dog is comfortable and you have a better understanding of their personality – what they enjoy, what makes them nervous – it will be easier to figure out how you want to focus your training.</p> <h2>Figure out what commands your dog really needs</h2> <p>Most people don’t need to teach their dog as many commands – some trainers call them cues – as they might think.</p> <p>“You only absolutely need two cues,” says Gagnong. “You need ‘sit’, and you need ‘come’.”</p> <p><strong>Sit. </strong>When a dog is sitting, “there are very few behavioral problems they can exhibit,” says Gagnon. “This is about getting them into a calm position.”</p> <p>To teach a dog to sit, say the word and then use a treat to get them into a sitting position, Gagnon says. Usually this can be done by showing them a treat and then moving it over and slightly behind their head, so when they track it with their nose, their head moves up and back and their rear drops.</p> <p><strong>Come.</strong> A recall cue is essential for safety. “Teaching a dog to come when called is about preventing them from running off into the road or into a dog fight,” says Gagnon.</p> <p>To teach a dog to come, you start by standing close to them, saying the cue, and giving them the treat when they come to you. Then you take a step back, and do the same thing. Over time, you call the dog from a greater and greater distance.</p> <p>Moberg says she also likes to teach dogs “touch”, where their nose presses into the palm of your hand.</p> <p>“It allows you to move the dog without having to physically manipulate their body,” she says.</p> <p>To train this, say the cue, hold an open hand out at snout level, and when your dog touches it with their nose, give them a treat. Repeat.</p> <p>Besides basic safety commands, think about training functionally, Sessa says. What is important for you and your dog’s life together? Maybe your dog never needs to be able to lie down, but they need to be able to walk well on a leash. “So focus on that,” says Sessa. “There’s no one-size-fits-all training regimen.”</p> <p>There’s no need to spend hours on training. Sessa says she usually suggests her clients work with their dogs for no more than 10 to 15 minutes a day.</p> <h2>For puppies: socialize, socialize, socialize</h2> <p>A lot of people think socializing a puppy means introducing them to as many other dogs as possible, says Gagnon. It’s actually a much broader task. “It’s about introducing them to everything that’s going to be a part of their world in a positive way,” Gagnon says.</p> <p>If you live in a loud, busy city, for example, it is important to help your puppy get used to loud city sounds. But don’t overdo it.</p> <p>“It’s not good socialization to take a puppy and put it down right next to a jackhammer,” says Gagnon. If a puppy seems scared or like they’re trying to hide, it is important not to push them or make them uncomfortable.</p> <p><strong>More from How to start:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/02/how-to-start-meditating\">How to start meditating</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training\">How to start weightlifting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/16/the-dreaded-b-word-how-to-start-budgeting\">How to start budgeting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/20/how-to-start-sunning\">How to start running</a></p></li> </ul> <p>“You can put them two blocks away from the jackhammer and give them a treat while they’re hearing that sound, and that’s good socialization.”</p> <p>“Food is a great way to help your puppy feel better about things,” says Sessa. For example, if they’re meeting new people, have the strangers toss them a treat. “That helps them create a positive association,” she adds.</p> <p>Experts also suggest enrolling your dog in puppy classes or puppy social hours. However, poorly managed puppy groups can do more harm than good. A well-run class, Sessa says, will be small, have the dogs separated by size and collect the dogs’ vaccine records. It should also be moderated by a certified dog trainer.</p> <h2>Know when to call in a pro</h2> <p>At-home training can be beneficial, but in some situations, it is best to get help from a trainer.</p> <p>“If there’s anything dangerous, if there have been bites that have resulted in punctures, call a professional,” says Gagnon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/05/how-to-start-habit-activity-expert-tips\">How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something new</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s no need to wait until your dog is fully grown. In particular, if a puppy is having issues with biting, Gagnon suggests reaching out to a trainer, even just for a single session. Remote options are often available. “Half an hour online or with phone support can be relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of an aggression problem down the road,” she says.</p> <p>Professionals can also be helpful when dealing with anxious dogs, because anxiety “can be so case specific”, says Gagnon. For instance, you might think your dog is suffering separation anxiety, but your dog could be stressed about something else. A trainer can observe “and tell you what you’re dealing with”, Gagnon says.</p> <p>Finally, it’s important to pick a qualified behavior consultant or dog trainer. Sessa recommends looking for professionals who are credentialed with the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC).</p> <p>New dog owners can easily become overwhelmed by all the information and training options available, Sessa says. “Try not to get too caught up with what you’re seeing online. Those people haven’t interacted with your specific dog.”</p>",

He told journalists: “Israel categorically rejects the libellous rant published today by this commission of inquiry.”</p> <p>Israel has rejected the charge of genocide, citing its right to self-defence after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, andtook 251 hostages. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 64,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.</p> <h2>What the report says</h2> <p>To count as genocide under the 1948 UN genocide convention, adopted after the murder of 6 million Jewish people in the Holocaust, at least one of five acts must have occurred. The UN commission accuses Israel of committing four. It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses and doctors, verified open-source documents, reporting by media and NGOs, and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began.</p> <p>In the <strong>first category</strong><strong> of killing</strong>, the commission quotes UN reporting that as of 15 July 2025, at least 46% of Palestinians killed in Gaza were women and children. The commission also cited reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">the Guardian</a> based on Israeli intelligence that 83% of those killed in Gaza were civilians.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Israel has used heavy unguided munitions with a wide margin of error in densely populated residential areas … The number of bombs used by Israel since 7 October 2023 is extraordinary even in comparison to other world conflicts.</p> <p>Palestinians in Gaza were attacked in their homes, at hospitals, in shelters (including schools and religious sites), during the evacuations and in designated safe zones. At times, civilians, journalists, healthcare professionals, humanitarian workers and other protected persons were directly targeted and killed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission highlighted the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/im-so-scared-please-come-hind-rajab-six-found-dead-in-gaza-12-days-after-cry-for-help\">five children</a> when their family car was targeted near a petrol station in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City on 29 January 2024, noting that Israeli security forces fired on an ambulance, “preventing access to the victims”.</p> <p>It also pointed to casualties that resulted from tight restrictions on humanitarian aid – especially medicine and medical equipment – from entering Gaza, quoting an obstetrician who spoke about deaths of pregnant women he had treated, whom he referred to as “indirect victims of war”.</p> <p>The commission describes at length the killing of 15 paramedics by Israeli forces in southern Gaza in March and “notes the consistent pattern of conduct demonstrated by the Israeli security forces in the aftermath of attacks, in that they have often denied and shifted responsibilities until evidence that contradicts their narrative surfaced”, also pointing to an acute lack of accountability.</p> <p>The report said Israeli authorities knew of the high numbers of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023 but “did not intervene to change the means and methods of warfare employed [but] persisted over time and caused even more Palestinian deaths”.</p> <p>“The Commission therefore finds that the Israeli authorities intended to kill as many Palestinians as possible through its military operations in Gaza since 7 October 2023 and knew that the means and methods of warfare employed would cause mass deaths of Palestinians, including children,” it says.</p>    <p>Turning to the <strong>second category</strong> <strong>of acts that qualify as genocidal, causing serious bodily or mental harm</strong>, the commission highlighted the mistreatment of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqldpyn5ng6o\">Palestinian detainees</a> by Israeli security forces and mass displacement which, it said, “has caused serious and irreparable physical and mental harm to Palestinians in Gaza who have lost their homes and have been forced to live in inhumane conditions”.</p> <p>In the <strong>third category</strong><strong> of deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</strong>, the report noted that much of Gaza had been rendered virtually uninhabitable, that huge numbers of bakeries, schools, cultural sites and religious landmarks had been completely destroyed, and that attacks on hospitals had led to a collapse of the healthcare system. It also highlighted the recent declaration by respected UN-backed monitors of famine in parts of Gaza.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Considering the evidence in totality, the Commission has found that Israeli authorities were aware of the high probability that their military operations, the imposition of a total siege … and the destruction of housing and of health systems and facilities would lead to the physical destruction of Palestinians, in whole or in part, in Gaza … The Commission therefore finds that Israeli authorities knowingly and deliberately inflicted such conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.</p> </blockquote> <p>The section on the <strong>fourth category</strong><strong> of imposing measures intended to prevent births</strong> is more concise, and focuses largely on the high proportion of casualties who were children, and the attack in December 2023 against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15npnzpd08o\">al-Basma IVF clinic</a>, Gaza’s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed about 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.</p> <p>“It is reasonable to conclude that the Israeli security forces knew of the function of the clinic and intended to target it and destroy the reproductive material within,” the report concludes, adding that “the widespread and systematic targeting of children is part of a strategy to destroy the biological continuity and future existence of the Palestinian group in Gaza”.</p>    <h2>Intent</h2> <p>International law experts say that it is often difficult to support genocide charges because of the requirement to prove intent, or even in some circumstances, sole intent.</p> <p>The commission concluded that statements by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other officials were “direct evidence of genocidal intent”.</p> <p>The report cited his letter to Israeli soldiers in November 2023 comparing the Gaza operation to what the commission describes as a “holy war of total annihilation” in the Hebrew Bible.</p> <p>The report also named the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant.</p> <p>Navi Pillay, the South African former judge who is the most senior of the report’s three authors, headed a UN tribunal for Rwanda where more than 1 million people were killed in 1994.</p> <p>“The commission concludes that statements made by Israeli authorities are direct evidence of genocidal intent [and] also concludes that the pattern of conduct is circumstantial evidence for genocidal intent and that genocidal intent was the only reasonably inference that can be drawn from the totality of the evidence,” she told reporters on Tuesday.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Creative director Stuart Vevers appeals to gen z audience with ‘down-to-earth pieces’ for New York fashion week</p>",
    "content": "<p>New York fashion week is proving a particularly perplexing time for brands as they continue to grapple with <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/luxury-market-faces-first-slowdown-study-estimates-decrease-1237927288/\">a global slowdown</a>, leading many to question what luxury even means today.</p> <p>For some consumers, it is always going to be about a gleaming five-figure handbag. For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.</p> <p>However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.</p> <p>Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.</p>    <p>Welcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.</p> <p>On the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/the-lyst-index/the-lyst-index-q2-25/\">Lyst Index</a>, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/tapestrys-sales-rise-on-popularity-of-coach-brand-5744f87f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjWn5B7_FiKqywF7GVXo6XIdrBjmyxniTJN94yYGfC6xLGwm1_yWqoKvkoWKgc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c8d290&amp;gaa_sig=NOFi37IP8xHfJGqWZcxkkw24UUiGqcLcT7Mc_xbeA4g9afi9RLQkiMEU9b6RIaeN915EO4WcjFcD29omMaMy4g%3D%3D\">$1.43bn since January</a>. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.</p> <p>While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”</p> <p>Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”</p> <p>Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.</p> <p>Coach is also leaning into its 84-year history. Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.</p> <p>Lopez has used previous catwalks to highlight issues including immigration and homophobia. This time around, he said he wanted to “pay tribute to the syncretic spirit of the Dominican Republic”. Lopez, who is a third-generation Dominican, played with texture using feathers and beading to add depth to bodysuits and tailoring. He described the collection as a confrontation of “the brutal legacy of slavery – how it fractured bodies, families and futures – yet simultaneously birthed radical forms of creativity, expression and resistance”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Engineer whose recommendations after the Ladbroke Grove train crash led to improved safety on the railways</p>",
    "content": "<p>When David Davies, who has died aged 89, was asked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/21/lord-prescott-john-prescott-obituary\">John Prescott</a>, the then deputy prime minister and transport secretary, to undertake an inquiry into the safety system on Britain’s railways after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/05/the-ladbroke-grove-rail-disaster-lessons-to-be-learned-20-years-on\">Ladbroke Grove train crash of 1999</a>, the BBC could not conceal its excitement. The report said: “Sir David Davies may not be a household name, but he is among the few people that the term genius can be applied to without overstatement.”</p> <p>Davies – known universally as Den, taken from his initials – probably enjoyed this description. Aged 12, while at Llandaff Catholic school in Cardiff, he knocked on the headmaster’s door to complain he was not being intellectually challenged and asked, successfully, to be moved up to the next class. He went on to a glittering career in industry and academia.</p> <p>Consequently, described by his colleagues as utterly unflappable and always calm, he did not hesitate to take on the task offered by Prescott, which came at a crucial time in the midst of something of a national panic about the state of the railways. The Ladbroke Grove disaster, in which 31 people died, was the worst accident on the railways since 1988 and the second major crash caused by a train going past a red signal, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/21/keithharper\">Southall two years previously</a>. There was widespread concern among the public that the railways were not safe and that not enough was being done to improve the situation.</p> <p>Fortunately, Prescott avoided a kneejerk response to public outrage, and instead put his trust in Davies, who had the relevant experience for the job. He was not only at the time the president of the <a href=\"https://www.raeng.org.uk/\">Royal Academy of Engineering</a>, a fairly new national academy whose creation had been at the behest of Prince Philip, but he had also worked in British Rail’s research department in the late 1960s and was familiar with the workings of the railway. His approach was meticulous and at the time controversial.</p> <p>His report, published in early 2000, was a thorough assessment of the two main technologies that were capable of reducing the risk of drivers failing to stop at a red signal. At the time, the newly privatised railways were introducing a fairly simple Train Protection &amp; Warning System, which was very effective but did not prevent certain types of overrun, notably if trains were going particularly fast. However, because the alternative system, Automatic Train Protection, was several times more expensive and would take far longer to install across the network, Davies strongly recommended the former, arguing that it would ultimately save more lives because of its rapid implementation.</p>    <p>The intervening quarter of a century has proved that he was right. The number of signals passed at danger on the railways has been reduced dramatically and, while there has been the occasional near miss, there has been no major accident involving signalling on the railways since then. His approach, of getting a good system implemented quickly rather than a perfect one brought in more slowly, was proved to be a brilliant judgment.</p> <p>Davies later briefly chaired an organisation called Railway Safety, which was set up to promote safety issues, and he focused on the poor state of much of the fencing protecting the tracks. This came to the fore after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/28/selby-rail-crash-driver-fate\">the 2001 Selby train crash</a>, when a Land Rover tumbled down an embankment and caused two trains to collide, killing 10 people.</p> <p>Born in Cardiff, to Sarah (nee Samuel) and David Davies, an estate agent, David Jr studied electrical engineering at the University of Birmingham, and was awarded his PhD in 1960; he later joined the staff. He met his future wife, Enid Patilla, there, but waited seven years before proposing to her as, he revealed later, he wanted to make sure he could provide for his future family. After several academic posts, notably at University College London and Loughborough University, where he was vice-chancellor, he became chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence in 1993, and the following year was knighted.</p> <p>While his Ladbroke Grove report was his most publicised work, it should not overshadow Davies’s remarkable achievements in scientific research, which was the source of the BBC’s approbation. His research work was varied, covering work in antenna arrays, radar, signal processing and optical fibres.</p> <p>It was the developments in the last of these that were particularly groundbreaking, as he invented fibreoptic sensors, which could provide sensitive measurement of quantities such as strain or temperature, and could even be the basis of a kilometre-long microphone with high dynamic range. All this was despite the fact that fibreoptic cables were at the time being championed in telecommunications for their insensitivity to disturbances and therefore unable to be used in this way. His research opened up a huge potential market for the wide use of fibreoptics.</p> <p>Consequently, for this work he won the Rank prize for optoelectronics in 1984. He later also won the Institution of Electrical Engineers’ Faraday medal in 1987. He served on the committees of many national bodies, including the BBC engineering advisory committee and the Royal Society’s science inquirycommittee.</p> <p>Enid died in 1990. In 1992 he married Jennifer Rayner, a chartered surveyor. She survives him, as do his two sons, Michael and Christopher, from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter, Ruth.</p> <p>• David Evan Naunton Davies, engineer and government adviser, born 28 October 1935; died 19 August 2025</p>",

    "description": "<p>Data public health experts say is worrisome will reportedly be presented to ACIP later this week before vote on shots</p>",
    "content": "<p>US health officials are reportedly planning to release data on child deaths and serious side effects they would attribute to Covid-19 vaccines, raising alarm among public health experts who say the publicly available data does not support these claims and the report may lead to increased anti-vaccine sentiment.</p> <p>Independent advisers for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) later this week plan to revisit recommendations for Covid shots as well as vaccines for measles and hepatitis B.</p> <p>The move is part of a larger effort to cast doubt on vaccines and reduce access to them, said David Gorski, a professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University who has <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/david-gorski/\">tracked</a> anti-vaccine activism for decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/cdc-leadership-loss-experts-alarmed\">‘Americans should be alarmed’: Experts say loss of expertise at CDC will harm US health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is a longtime anti-vaxxer who continues to make sweeping, controversial changes to the US vaccine program, Gorski said.</p> <p>“RFK Jr wants to take away your vaccines,” he said.</p> <p>Officials are looking at 25 reports of pediatric deaths following Covid vaccination, apparently stemming from the crowdsourced database known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/\">reporting</a> by the Washington Post.</p> <p>Yet years of data and research show that Covid vaccinations are safe and effective.</p> <p>“Covid vaccination involved much larger numbers of people receiving vaccines than we’ve had for anything in history,” said Anne Schuchat, a former principal deputy director of the CDC.</p> <p>Using VAERS to cast doubt on the safety of vaccines is a decades-long anti-vax tactic, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16452357/\">research</a> has shown a spike in reports related to litigation, Gorski said.</p> <p>While the system can help discover red flags, Schuchat noted it can’t be used to demonstrate causality.</p> <p>“Anybody can report into it,” she said – including patients, family members, lawyers, friends and people on social media. One doctor successfully submitted a report on his transformation into the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060427200248/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism\">Incredible Hulk</a>.</p> <p>The child deaths report is expected to be presented at the meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) later this week.</p> <p>Staff at the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process”, said Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson, in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>“Until that is shared publicly, any of this should be considered pure speculation.”</p> <p>ACIP will vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth, and Covid vaccines – and it will also hold votes for the Vaccines for Children program, which provides shots to nearly half of children in the US.</p> <p>It’s not clear what the ACIP votes will entail, but experts believe some of the shots may be restricted and others may lose their recommendation, which would affect insurance coverage – especially from Medicaid and Medicare.</p> <p>“If it’s not on the CDC recommended schedule, then insurance companies don’t have to pay for it,” Gorski said. “Federal government programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not pay for it, the Vaccines for Children program will not pay for it. Now, insurance companies might decide to pay for it anyway, at least within the FDA guidelines, but there’s no guarantee that they all will.”</p> <p>On Monday, days before the ACIP meeting is set to begin, HHS announced five more advisers, some of whom have a history of troubling statements on vaccines and infectious disease.</p> <p>There are other safety systems to flag side effects, like the Vaccine Safety Datalink, that are confirmed by medical records and also provide comparisons to understand if an unanticipated adverse event is linked to vaccines, Schuchat said. It’s not clear if the report will pull from these sources.</p> <p>“We are getting the data that was never made available before, including adverse event data,” Marty Makary, head of the FDA , told CNN earlier this month.</p> <p>Those possible adverse events include “young people who have died from the Covid vaccine”, he added. “And we’re going to make that available to the medical community in full transparency, because this is the question that Americans are asking.”</p> <p>Kennedy’s team at HHS reportedly requested full access to VAERS, including the ability to modify the database.</p> <p>“We allowed them to have read access but would not give them write access,” said Peter Marks, the former vaccines chief at FDA.</p> <p>Reports of death, especially among children, would be “the top priority” for health officials, said Gorski.</p> <p>Any reports of serious side effects are investigated by officials at the CDC and FDA, said Schuchat.</p> <p>“There is a deep look into the death of a child or particularly worrisome reports,” she said.</p> <p>Now, the FDA seems to be reopening these reports. It’s not clear whether the FDA is doing anything differently with these investigations now, or how they would reclassify deaths as vaccine-related.</p> <p>“Anything’s possible,” Schuchat said. “We’re in new territory right now.”</p> <p>FDA could also temporarily pull the licenses of Covid vaccines while it investigates potential events, or it could add a black-box warning about the purported risks of the vaccine.</p> <p>Yet the FDA recently granted full licensure to Covid vaccines <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/drdemetre.bsky.social/post/3lynsfagw4s24\">without raising concerns</a> about credible safety issues.</p> <p>Changes to the CDC’s recommendations could instead limit the vaccines until most people can’t access them, Gorski said. “My fear is that within a year, the Covid vaccines will be gone, for all intents and purposes.”</p> <p>Anti-vax officials seem to view the Covid shots as a “test case” or a template for restricting access to other vaccines, Gorski said, before adding that the hepatitis B vaccine currently given at birth may lose its recommendation as soon as this week.</p> <p>More than 1,000 current and former HHS employees have called for Kennedy’s resignation because of moves like this – including Schuchat.</p> <p>“It’s really scary, the actions he’s taking and the people he seems to be trusting,” she said of Kennedy. “This person has so much authority right now.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a tough week for Labour, Donald Trump is touching down for a state visit. Let’s hope the PM can stomach it</p>",
    "content": "<p>Quick update on Keir Starmer’s government of “national renewal”: having just lost his deputy and housing secretary over her failure to pay the required stamp duty, the prime minister has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">lost his US ambassador</a> over his known close association with a known paedophile sex trafficker. Hang on – he’s now also lost his director of political strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/senior-starmer-adviser-paul-ovenden-quits-over-offensive-diane-abbott-messages\">relating some dirty jokes</a> about Diane Abbott.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an increasing number of people think the solution to all this is Andy Burnham taking over, suggesting the current Greater Manchester mayor could run in a parliamentary seat that has only notionally become free because the previous Labour MP was suspended from the party after being found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/10/labour-was-told-about-vile-whatsapp-group-more-than-a-year-ago-says-ex-councillor\">sent messages</a> hoping a couple of constituents would soon be dead/“mown down”, and is now apparently “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLVgxUGIodU/\">off sick</a>”. On top of which, we’re having the Americans round. US president Donald Trump touches down in the UK tonight on the eve of the most hideously ill-starred dinner party since the vomiting scene in Triangle of Sadness. I don’t think the nation could possibly feel any more renewed.</p> <p>It’s been a few days since Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein were held up in front of the public using the hazmat tongs, and the more I’ve thought about them, the more I come back to one of the more obscure lines. Writing in apparent anguish on the eve of Epstein’s incarceration in 2008, Mandelson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/peter-mandelson-messages-jeffrey-epstein-disturbing-and-sickening-says-minister\">opines to him</a>: “It just could not happen in Britain.” Maybe he was right, unwittingly or otherwise. Britain is very, very good at a sort of institutionalised looking away. Maybe Mandelson was – unwittingly or otherwise – characterising something grim about this country that pious old Keir Starmer would no doubt be hugely affronted to be caught up in. Except, the prime minister <em>is</em> caught up in it – in fact, he’s at the very centre of it. He is the one who looked away.</p> <p>It’s hard not to feel there is something necrotic and beaten about a government whose leader would appoint someone he knew had been very close to Epstein, who the entire world by that point knew was – and forgive me for repeating the words – a paedophile sex trafficker. Association with him was already known to be such a horror show that the late Queen Elizabeth II had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/chucked-under-royal-bus-prince-andrews-demotion-shows-institutions-ruthlessness\">sack her own son</a> for it. And there is something worse about Starmer’s horrifying lack of curiosity even as the facts closed in, right till the bitter end, with No 10 dithering for staggeringly long last week over a set of quite the most disqualifying emails, while Starmer fannied about defending Mandelson at the dispatch box.</p> <p>This was, of course, the other dispatch box to the one at which Sir Keir plied his holier-than-thou trade in opposition. There’s an old online rule that declares that if you tell someone off for their spelling or grammar, you will always end up making your own howler while you’re doing it. Starmer spent his years in opposition telling off the Tories at every turn, instead of – for instance – coming up with a creative and coherent plan for growth. Inevitably, we now seem to be strapped in to watching him and his administration warrant a daily telling-off, as offences and immoralities mount up. Why does this keep happening to him, etc?</p> <p>As for Epstein, we know that at the time Mandelson was writing to him telling him to fight for early release, police in Palm Beach, Florida had identified 36 girls<strong> </strong>who the “financier” had sexually abused. Yet for all the many years of grim and grotesque revelations, it still feels as though we know remarkably little about him. Who was he, this mysterious paedo Gatsby, and where did all his money come from?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/peter-mandelson-keir-starmer-labour\">It’s over and out (again) for Mandelson, but how many political lives does Starmer have left? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly after his death, New York magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/hedge-funders-have-some-thoughts-on-what-epstein-was-doing.html\">ran a fascinating story</a> in which real hedge-funders expressed pointed bemusement over how Epstein made his money, since none of them had really had any dealings with him. As one big hedge-fund president, Doug Kass, put it: “I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested. Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.” As Kass had said to a journalist: “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” Or as another hedgie remarked: “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” And yet Epstein had made no noise at all in the financial world. They could barely find one investor. Their general theory was that the “hedge fund” was simply a cover for a blackmail scheme.</p> <p>Perhaps most amazing, really, is the fact that Epstein will be a ghost at the feast tomorrow night for more than one attender, as Trump continues to butch out his long and close association with precisely the type of evildoer his Maga followers are convinced runs the world. Epstein is a guy who really does fit the very template of their darkest conspiracy theories – rich and powerful, involved in the trafficking of minors, connected in a network of some of the most powerful people in the world. This is all the sort of stuff they’ve been going on about for years – yet who should keep rearing his head in the story, but their own beloved president.</p> <p>Isn’t it intriguing how many of them (currently) just can’t bring themselves to believe it? Something to discuss over the starter tomorrow night at Windsor Castle, perhaps, as long as everyone can keep their food down.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "<p>A play by the Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/29/black-panther-actor-chadwick-boseman-dies-of-cancer\">died of cancer aged 43</a> in 2020, is to receive its UK premiere next year.</p> <p>Deep Azure was written by Boseman in response to the death of Prince Jones, his fellow college student at Washington DC’s Howard University, who was killed in 2000 by a police officer. The play was first performed in 2005 in the US and will be staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in February, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/02/chadwick-boseman-theatre-black-panther\">‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick Boseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fynn-Aiduenu described the play as “incredibly poignant in speaking about the injustices of police brutality and the unwinding nature of grief, but also the gorgeous brilliance of our Black Souls and exploring every hue they can express on a stage”. He said that Boseman’s love of Shakespeare and hip-hop combined in a “layered, ghostly epic that I have been given the privilege and duty to fully realise”.</p> <p>Boseman was best known for his performance in the title role of Marvel’s Black Panther, and was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10514222/?ref_=nmawd_awd_1\">Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</a>, based on August Wilson’s play. But before he rose to fame as an actor, he had shown himself to be a promising playwright.</p> <p>The director Derrick Sanders, another Howard University alumnus who commissioned Deep Azure, told the Guardian in 2020 that Boseman took the elements of hip-hop culture – graffiti, DJing, rapping, breakdancing – “and combined them into a narrative form. The storytelling would move it in and out of hip-hop, almost as a precursor to Hamilton.”</p> <p>Boseman studied Shakespeare at Oxford University with the British American Drama Academy in 1998. He had wanted to make a film of Deep Azure before his Hollywood career exploded. Daniel Banks, who directed the play at the <a href=\"https://www.folger.edu/folger-theatre\">Folger theatre in Washington DC</a>, said that it was “written as a ritual of community healing”. The killing of Jones by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000 was also covered by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates in the 2015 book Between the World and Me. In 2006, after a civil trial, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/25/AR2006092501456.html\">damages were awarded</a> to Jones’s young daughter for his wrongful death.</p> <p>Deep Azure will run from 7 February to 11 April in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the indoor candlelit venue run by Shakespeare’s Globe. It will be performed alongside a new production of The Tempest (17 January to 12 April) directed by Tim Crouch, who will play Prospero alongside Naomi Wirthner (How to Train Your Dragon)<em><strong> </strong></em>as Ariel.</p> <p>Crouch is the creator of a series of acclaimed Shakespearean dramas presented from the perspective of the plays’ minor characters, including I, Caliban and I, Banquo. He said he had “been given the keys to the most interesting theatre in London. The spaces at the Globe are not anonymous black boxes that try to disappear as soon as the play begins. They are companions to any work that happens in them; good companions which support and contribute to the stories that they house.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The year is 2125 and an AI-powered hologram of Elon Musk is CEO of The World, Inc. Nation states are defunct and “citizens” an outdated concept. Now people function more like non-voting shareholders of heavily armed corporations. Anyone who dares to criticise Lord Musk is sentenced to death in a burning Tesla.</p> <p>This isn’t my poor attempt at science fiction (apart from some creative licence around the AI Musk and Tesla executions). Rather, it’s a simplified approximation of the world Curtis Yarvin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html\">Silicon Valley’s favourite thinker</a>, wants to usher in. Yarvin, whose “dark enlightenment” ideas have influenced the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552\">Trump administration</a> and political kingmakers <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2022/05/the-strange-and-terrifying-ideas-of-neoreactionaries\">such as Peter Thiel</a>, believes super-rich elites should have dictatorial powers; universities and the press shouldn’t hold any sway; and the hoi polloi should suck it all up.</p> <p>Musk is not a straightforward disciple of Yarvin, but both believe governments should be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-trumps-reign-fits-curtis-yarvins-blueprint-of-a-ceo-led-american-monarchy-what-is-technological-fascism-256202\">treated as corporations</a> and share disdain for liberal democracy and “woke” institutions. Both also have a raze-and-rebuild approach to the world. Indeed, long before Musk launched his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Yarvin devised <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/08/curtis-yarvin-doge-musk-thiel/\">Rage</a>, a plan to “retire all government employees”. Yarvin, by the way, wasn’t impressed with Doge (he compared it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner) because it didn’t grab enough power.</p> <p>I bring all this up because, as Musk vies for a larger role on the world stage, it’s imperative we’re clear about what he’s trying to achieve. The billionaire, who spent <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">more than $290m</a> (£210m) influencing the US election, is increasingly taking his political meddling worldwide: he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/canada-election-elon-musk-justin-trudeau\">inserted himself into Canadian politics</a> earlier this year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/elon-musk-afd-germany-mainstream-far-right\">helped boost</a> Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk spent January posting about grooming gangs in the UK and turned his attention back to the country over the weekend, appearing via video at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">far-right rally</a> in London. Musk called for a “change of government” and said: “Violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” A man who was born in South Africa but emigrated to the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/canada-musk-petition-revoke-citizenship-00205964\">by way of Canada</a> wants Britons to be terrified of foreigners.</p> <p>So what’s the end goal here? Is Musk being guided by a Yarvinesque ideology or is this just what happens when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/elon-musk-trump-drug-use\">industrial amounts of ketamine</a> the billionaire is reported to have consumed interact with the world’s largest ego?</p> <p>While a God complex may be at play, a politics of chaos appears to be Musk’s short-term goal. It feels increasingly as if the tech mogul is trying to stoke civil unrest and destabilise democracies worldwide so he can accumulate more power. In his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">new year address</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">Robert Habeck</a>, Germany’s vice-chancellor at the time, came to a similar conclusion, calling Musk’s support for the AfD a “logical and systematic” play to weaken Europe. “A weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power,” Habeck said.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s weaknesses – his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">approval rating</a> is dismal – certainly seem to have captured Musk’s interest. Musk may not have an ideology as developed as Yarvin’s, but it does feel as if he’s attempting to become de facto CEO of the world, with deputies around the globe. It’s not inconceivable that Musk could effect regime change in Britain. And I’m not sure the government is taking this threat seriously enough. At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-palestine-action-the-ban-on-gaza-activists-must-be-overturned\">pensioners are being arrested</a> for waving “Palestine Action” placards, the response to Musk’s calls for people to “fight back or … die” at a protest where 26 police officers were injured could have been somewhat more forceful. Starmer should impose sanctions on Musk, not just wag his finger at him.</p> <p>What’s really at issue here, however, is the system that produced Musk and enabled his meddling. A healthy democracy should have safeguards in place that ensure a handful of super-rich individuals can’t usurp the political process. Those safeguards were removed from the US in 2010 with the supreme court’s <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\">Citizens United ruling</a>, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and in effect allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Britain has nowhere near the amount of money sloshing through its politics as the US does, but an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/30/uk-political-donations-dark-money\">analysis last</a> year found dark money is rife: almost £1 in every £10 donated to British parties and politicians came from unknown or dubious sources.</p> <p>Musk is odious, but he is right that Britain is under threat: if we don’t fight to conserve democracy, it will die. However, the foreigners we should worry about are not desperate people on small boats, they’re billionaires with rocket ships.</p> <p><em>• </em>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Kipyegon delivered a gun-to-tape run that destroyed the field as she came home clear in 3 minutes 52.15 seconds. The world record holder matches Hicham El Guerrouj (1997-2003) by claiming four world 1,500m golds and she will also go for a second world 5,000m title later this week.

Orlando Bennett ran a personal best 13.08 to win silver, while his fellow Jamaican Tyler Mason took the bronze in 13.12, which matched his previous best time.

Should she win, the three-time Olympic and three-time world champion will draw level with Hicham El Guerrouj, who won this race at this meet on four occasions, and at 31, it’s incumbent upon us to savour her while we still can.</p> \n  <p>Or, in other words, Mondo needs to budge up, because there are others planning to take out a des res inside our heads.</p> \n  <p><strong>Action starts: 7.35pm local, 11.35am BST</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div>",

Deals involving Nvidia, the world’s largest AI chip maker, and OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI assistant, are anticipated.</p> <p>But campaigners have said a wave of massive new computer warehouses will crank up Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on finite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/22/ai-data-centre-power-consumption\">power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/17/ai-boom-environment-agency-cannot-predict-future-water-shortages-england-data-centres\">water resources</a>.</p> <p>If allowed, the Thurrock complex will include up to four datacentres on “grey belt” land part-occupied by a former speedway and stock car track.

Google’s planning application stresses this remains a “minor adverse and not significant impact when compared to the UK carbon budgets”, but campaigners disagree.</p> <p>“Google’s planned facility in Essex will produce carbon emissions several times higher than those of an international airport,” said a spokesperson for Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology. “But this is just one of many ‘hyperscale’ datacentres that US big tech wants to impose on the UK – in pursuit of their own profits and regardless of the cost to our environment.</p> <p>“Starmer’s government needs to stop bowing to the Trump-big tech agenda and start standing up for the interests of the UK public – otherwise we will all be paying for the tech giants’ datacentres, whether in terms of soaring energy bills, dwindling water supplies or a heating planet.”</p> <p>Datacentres now <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-01-27/debates/7D94F44D-EA1F-4D0F-87A8-2B5BCFD00DEF/InternetActivityEnergyUse\">consume about 2.5% of the UK’s electricity</a>, and demand on the grid is expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report\">to increase fourfold by 2030</a>, according to the House of Commons library.</p> <p>The British government does not believe datacentres will have a significant impact on the UK’s carbon budget because of its ambitious targets for electricity grid decarbonisation. Rather it is worried that without massive investment in new datacentres, the UK will fall behind international rivals, including France, resulting in a “compute gap” that “risks undermining national security, economic growth, and the UK’s ambition to lead in AI”, according to a July research paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.</p> <p>Other important datacentre projects include a £10bn scheme on the site of a former coal-fired power station near Blyth in Northumberland that was granted planning permission in March. It is poised to be at the heart of a UK-US deal involving Nvidia and OpenAI. It was also reported at the weekend that Google is in early-stage talks about building a mammoth datacentre on Teesside.</p> <p>Bain &amp; Company, a global business consultancy, said on Monday that AI and datacentres could account for 2% of global emissions and 17% of industrial emissions by 2035, with the impact highest in countries where fossil fuels still dominate power generation.</p> <p>Google declined to comment on its planning application for the Thurrock site. On Teesside, it said: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The thinking behind Sainsbury’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">£1bn-plus purchase of Argos back in 2016</a> wasn’t entirely other-worldly. The big idea was that, by putting Argos general merchandise shops within Sainsbury’s supermarkets, both chains would benefit via a customer crossover effect. But the problem was also screamingly obvious: why volunteer to step in front of Amazon’s non-food steamroller?</p> <p>Simon Roberts became chief executive of Sainsbury’s in 2020, replacing Mike Coupe, the architect of the Argos deal, and immediately indicated where he stood. His “food first” strategy wasn’t quite a declaration that he viewed Argos as inessential to the day job of competing with Tesco et al, but it wasn’t far off.</p> <p>Thus nobody was surprised by Sainsbury’s confirmation on Saturday that it was considering an approach for Argos from JD.com, the enormous Chinese retailer. The identity of the would-be buyer was logical – JD.com <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/19/currys-shares-soar-china-jd-com-takeover-battle-elliott\">publicly flirted with the idea of bidding for electrical chain Curry’s last year</a> and is still thought to be keen on a splashy entry into the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">Sainsbury’s talks to sell Argos to Chinese retailer JD.com collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunday, however, brought news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">the talks were off</a> already because, said Sainsbury’s, JD.com would only engage on “materially revised terms and commitments”. In negotiation-speak, that’s like calling the other side a bunch of time-wasters. The talks look properly dead. Everybody knows Argos isn’t worth what it was in 2016, but it’s still a substantial business.</p> <p>There is still a possible upside to the messy weekend saga for those Sainsbury’s investors who view Argos as unwanted baggage. The mere fact of talks suggests Argos has not become so enmeshed in Sainsbury’s infrastructure that the business could never be separated and sold.</p> <p>Of the 664 Argos shops, 461 are within a Sainsbury’s store, so a divorce would still be tricky. But more and more of Argos’s trade is going online, so perhaps there is still somebody out there who would want the 200-odd rump stand-alone shops, allowing Sainsbury’s to take back its store space to put to better use.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s doesn’t reveal Argos’s profits, but <a href=\"https://corporate.sainsburys.co.uk/media/s4giiar0/j-sainsbury-plc_more-argos-more-often_nl24-2.pdf\">the detail-free charts</a> it occasionally publishes suggest margins are slim (certainly slimmer than in the supermarkets) and have been getting slimmer in recent years. On the other hand, turnover at Argos is almost £5bn and digitalisation has happened, so perhaps there is still an appeal for somebody.</p> <p>For Roberts, Argos is best viewed as a low-level headache. Its presence is annoying for shareholders who would prefer a pure grocery-only story, especially now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/20/natwest-buy-sainsburys-bank-deal\">Sainsbury’s has sold most of its bank</a>. But the core supermarket business isn’t obviously being distracted – and the weekend update confirmed this year’s expectations on operating profit and cashflow, which helped the share price. The worry is more the medium-term one that, one day, the demand on Argos to stand on its own feet internally will become impossible to maintain.</p> <p>It would have been better if Argos had never been bought in the first place because the competitive pressure in non-food is relentless. But it is still fair to turn down offers at silly prices. Roberts has a couple of years to find an alternative – either a self-help fix of Argos or a sale on respectable terms. The task is not easy, but nor should it be impossible.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dancer and later chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet who took leading roles at the Wallace Collection and then Strawberry Hill House in London</p>",
    "content": "<p>Derek Purnell, who has died aged 71 of a brain tumour, had a career focused on the arts and heritage encompassing both performance and administration. He had a true sense of purpose and the ability to inspire his colleagues, and always took an interest in their work.</p> <p>In 1991 he took up the position of chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB), working alongside Peter Wright, the artistic director, and from 1995 with David Bintley. In a tribute, Bintley noted that the decade he worked alongside Purnell at the BRB was “the happiest and most fulfilling of my professional life”. Having danced with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, the touring wing of the Royal Ballet, for a decade from 1973, and having become a dancers’ union representative, when Purnell retired from performing he trained in arts administration at City, University of London. </p> <p>He then returned to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, where he managed the company’s 1988 tour to Asia, and was given the task of organising the relocation of the company to Birmingham to make its home at the Hippodrome. Knowing the working conditions dancers aspired to having danced at theatres with less-than-ideal backstage facilities, he ensured appropriate studios and custom-built facilities were provided there. </p>    <p>He became a valued ambassador for Birmingham as a place to work, reassuring the dancers and staff who would be leaving London. In 1990 the move was complete, and the company became Birmingham Royal Ballet. Purnell also played a leading role in securing BRB’s independence from the Royal Opera House.</p> <p>In 2005 he moved from Birmingham to a small village in Norfolk, and began a career as a freelance consultant. He helped to promote the arts in the county and worked with Norfolk Dance. During this period he suffered with and recovered from from throat cancer. </p> <p>When the opportunity to join the Wallace Collection as director of public engagement arose in 2014, he moved to London. At this museum housing fine art in Manchester Square, off Oxford Street, he championed collaborations between art, music and dance and encouraged the development of outreach programmes. </p> <p>Three years later he became chief operations officer. He missed being involved with events, so in July 2020 he became director of Strawberry Hill House and Gardens, Twickenham. Strawberry Hill, Horrace Walpole’s 18th-century gothic house had been lovingly restored in the decade from 2004 and Purnell knew he had to balance preserving the building and keeping it alive. </p> <p>He enjoyed being involved in making new acquisitions and loans; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/may/07/catherine-de-medici-1561-portrait-to-return-to-london-mansion\">a portrait of Catherine de Medici,</a> whom Walpole admired, was added to the gallery, and a fishtub from Walpole’s collection – in which his cat was said to have drowned, inspiring Thomas Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.thomasgray.org/texts/poems/odfc\">Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes </a>– was also displayed.</p> <p>Purnell supported a range of exhibitions both in the house and online, including one on gothic toy theatres, and community activities in the garden.</p> <p>Born and brought up in Bristol, Derek claimed that the port city aroused his curiosity about history. He was the younger of two sons of Betty (nee Cornish), an office worker, and John Purnell, who worked for Rolls-Royce. Derek was educated at Monks Park comprehensive, where he enjoyed the benefit of inspiring teachers of English and art; he also studied ballet, taking classes with Bettie Vowles.</p>    <p>At 16 he was accepted into the Royal Ballet upper school, from where he graduated to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet in 1973. He was a versatile performer whose height was an advantage. At one performance he would mime older characters including the Duke of Courland in Giselle or the Russian Merchant in Léonide Massine’s La Boutique Fantasque, at the next he revealed his technical skills in the pas de six from Les Rendezvous, the Gypsy Girl’s Lover in The Two Pigeons, Lysander in The Dream and even a Tomato in Pas de Légumes – all ballets by Frederick Ashton. </p> <p>Purnell was also noted for dancing choreography by George Balanchine. While a leading dancer in the corps de ballet, he was chosen for the male lead, partnering Vyvyan Lorrayne, in Concerto Barocco, of which the Times critic wrote: “Derek Purnell in the slow movement supports her with a wholly admirable reticence, almost achieving the illusion that it is Bach’s music rather than his arms causing her to soar above the stage.”</p> <p>In 1974 he married Elizabeth Cunliffe, a dancer and Benesh movement notator, with whom he had a daughter, Louise. That marriage was dissolved, and in 1982 he married Aileen Morrison, a viola player who worked with many orchestras. They met when she was playing with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet orchestra. Their daughter Kirsty now teaches on several dance outreach programmes.</p> <p>Purnell retained his love of dance, serving as a governor of the Royal Ballet, and was active on several committees, including serving as vice-chair of the board of trustees of the Royal Academy of Dance. In 2024 Purnell was on the verge of taking up the position of executive director of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.</p> <p>He is survived by Aileen and his two daughters.</p> <p>• Derek James Purnell, dancer and arts administrator, born 5 April 1954; died 2 August 2025</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/giant-rock-hudson-james-dean-elizabeth-taylor-epic-family-drama",
    "description": "<p>Hudson, Dean and Elizabeth Taylor make a thrilling trio in this decades-spanning saga set on a scorching Texan ranch</p>",
    "content": "<p>“I think Rock Hudson worked best with a big background,” says film historian Steve Hayes in a biography of the Hollywood heart-throb, “in a big melodrama against a big landscape”. It doesn’t get much bigger than George Stevens’ three-and-a-half-hour epic Giant, starring the towering Hudson – who stood 6ft 5in at the height of his fame.</p> <p>Adapted from Edna Ferber’s 1952 bestseller of the same name, Giant is a film of great conscience and scale, tracing multiple decades of a southern family reckoning with social and political tailwinds on their ranch. Often described as the national movie of Texas, Giant actually begins further east in the state of Maryland where Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr (Hudson) has journeyed to buy a horse fit for his 595,000 acres of land. There he meets and quickly marries debutante Leslie Lynnton, played by a young Elizabeth Taylor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elMP6PqGBo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/elMP6PqGBo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Without second thought, the well-mannered, equestrian flower of the east – a clear case of typecasting for Taylor, who earlier won hearts as a teenage horse-whisperer in National Velvet – leaves it all behind for a life saddled at Bick’s side on his grand cattle ranch under the flaming Texan sun.</p> <p>“Hot? It was about 120 degrees in the shade!” Taylor <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=7L1PbtXSjClZrgxh&amp;v=pV2HaQtqy4M&amp;feature=youtu.be\">said of the storied summer shoot</a>, which took a horrific turn when co-star Mercedes McCambridge was seriously scarred after make-up melted into her skin, burning her neck. Ironically, it’s McCambridge’s Luz, Bick Benedict’s spinster sister, that is most at home in these scorching conditions. Early in the film, Luz hosts an outdoor barbecue on a sweltering day to welcome her new sister-in-law to the community, which includes the avoidant ranch-hand Jett Rink – played by Giant’s true star James Dean. Luz’s friendly hazing sees Leslie faint before the entire town. As an easterner, her blood is “too thin” for Texas.</p> <p>Yet from the moment of her arrival, Leslie’s presence brings about an important shift in the town. Unlike her husband, she shows basic respect for Mexican workers on the ranch – her progressive instincts no doubt a reflection of the political upbringing she received as an upper-class girl in the more progressive Maryland.</p>    <p>In the many years it spans, Giant endeavours to form a political picture of the south, from early debates between the newlyweds over the status of Texas as a “stolen state” to the penultimate scene where Bick brawls with a small-business owner refusing service to a Mexican family. The great accomplishment of the story is that it is one where a man of great stature admits that he was wrong.</p> <p>The other primary thread in Giant<em> </em>is the making of another man – Jett – into an emperor. With his humble beginnings as a worker on Bick’s station, Jett comes into a great fortune when he discovers the small share of the ranch bequeathed to him by the late Luz sits above an oil well. His realisation is a moment of spectacular eruption: the well ejaculates suddenly, spraying his humble plot with glorious black grease. Jett is going to be a very wealthy man – the consequences of which become clear as the years tick by and characters age.</p> <p>Early in the casting process Stevens made the unusual decision to hire actors in their 20s as his three leads, each of which would go on to play their characters in middle age during Giant’s second act. In his transformation, Hudson, who was 28 at the time, wore a 50-pound belt as padding around his waist. He and the 23-year-old Taylor wore substantial make-up to create the illusion – and yet it was Dean, as a greying oil tycoon, that transformed most convincingly. The actor refused the same cosmetics as his co-stars, arguing that “a man of 45 shows his age in thoughts and actions, not in wrinkles”. Dean’s performance – informed by his time in Texas with real cowboys – is a masterclass in swagger, down to Jett’s speech pattern and the way he wears his big hat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/13/hooper-the-film-that-turned-the-stuntman-into-a-movie-star\">Hooper: the film that turned the stuntman into a movie star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a reliquary of three of Hollywood’s brightest stars, Giant also imagines an alternate history where Hudson, Taylor and Dean were allowed to age alongside one another. Hudson died of Aids in the mid-80s, becoming one of the first beloved public figures associated with the disease. Fans across the world were shocked to find their hero reduced to a sick old man, sadly more sick than he was old. Needless to say, James Dean never aged beyond Giant. He famously crashed his race car in California shortly after filming was complete. Taylor was the only one who survived well into the 21st century in a life defined by both richesse and heartbreak, alternatingly assailed and adored by the public eye until her death, aged 79.</p> <p>Witnessing the trio in Giant now feels like summoning ghosts. When 200 minutes have elapsed and the film is finally over, it’s almost a disappointment. Thanks to the cavalcade of great heroes that descended on Marfa, Texas, back in 1955, the night sky of the Lone Star state never looked so bright.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Giant is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US.

For some teams the high number of tackles might be a pointer to the opposition having their hands on the ball more often, but for the Pies it is a reminder that their miserly defence begins with a combativeness at the contest and being the best team in the competition for pressure all over the field. Even with a side packed with players aged on the high side of 30, the Magpies are likely to hit the ground fresh and full of running in what will be just their second game in 29 days.</p>    <p>Brisbane will have to take the long route to reach the grand final but showed last year that they can overcome that hurdle with four straight finals victories on the way to premiership glory. A return to the MCG should hold few fears for the Lions who won five in a row at the venue before a surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">lacklustre display in the qualifying final defeat</a> to Geelong. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/13/afl-semi-final-brisbane-lions-gold-coast-suns-match-report\">The reigning premiers bounced back</a> the following week – as they have so often done after a defeat this year – to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">thump bitter rivals Gold Coast</a> with a reminder of how freely they can score when their midfield and forward line click.</p> <p>The Lions will miss the injured Lachie Neale for a second week in a row but showed in the resounding win over the Suns that they have enough depth to still compete with – and even overpower – the strongest onball brigades. The reigning premiers are the best of the remaining four teams for clearances with an average of 40.4 a game, as well as for clearance differential (+4.7), and built their victory at the coalface with 51-34 clearances the last time they took on the Magpies.</p> <h2>Game shapers</h2> <p><strong>Collingwood: Steele Sidebottom – </strong>the Magpies veteran was considering retirement at times last year but again looks to have plenty left in his legs as he lines up for a 28th final and ninth preliminary final. The 34-year-old has booted 15 goals and averaged 21.4 disposals this year but it is Sidebottom’s ability to make an impact when the game is on the line that continues to set him apart. The versatile midfielder broke the game open when booting three of the Pies’ five goals as they snatched back the lead from the Crows and then powered away either side of the main break in a burst that set up their qualifying final win. Sidebottom might not have the pace that he once did but the player who booted the Magpies’ last goal in the 2023 grand final victory over the Lions has more than enough class and composure to remain a match-turning threat.</p>    <p><strong>Brisbane: Cam Rayner – </strong>the Lions dynamo has become a September specialist as he rises to the occasion in finals whether settling forward or mixing in bursts in the midfield. Rayner came under fire for the way he went to ground easily to earn a pair of contentious free kicks during the qualifying loss to Geelong but responded in the best possible way against Gold Coast with his brute force on full display. The 25-year-old shrugged off eight Suns tackles during the semi-final including stepping out of one before launching a long bomb to goal from barely in front of the centre circle. When Rayner plays well, the Lions tend to win, making the prospect of a match-up with rugged Pies defender Brayden Maynard likely to be pivotal to the result – and mouth-watering for fans.</p> <h2>Early prediction</h2> <p>Collingwood need no reminder of the threat that Brisbane pose when they are at their best but can turn to refreshed veterans to edge the reigning premiers in another finals classic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Claims on social media feeds are that synthetic hormones cause infertility and affect romantic choices. Experts say unintended pregnancies have reached ‘concerning levels’</p><ul><li><p>Read more in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral series</a></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>In the 1960s it was considered a watershed moment of liberation for women. Now, a new generation is being inundated with messages online that birth control is “evil” and “poison”. Across social media feeds, influencers are venting about hormonal contraception. Some are spreading false claims that taking synthetic hormones causes infertility, or can even be responsible for bad romantic decisions because you are “attracted to different men than you would be if you were off the pill”. Others emphasise known side-effects, such as weight gain and depression.</p> <p>Meanwhile, millions of TikToks promote the effectiveness of natural contraceptive methods, with self-described “hormone experts” claiming it is “not that hard to prevent pregnancy naturally” with fertility awareness methods “just as effective, if not more effective than the birth control pill.”</p> <p>Experts such as Dr Sarah White, the CEO of Jean Hailes for Women’s Health, say the “misinformation is extraordinary” and are seriously concerned about the potential consequences for women.</p> <h2>What is this trend?</h2> <p>Researchers at La Trobe University <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psrh.70025\">analysed 100 TikTok videos</a> from the top five hashtags related to contraception methods (#birthcontrol, #contraception, #thepill, #naturalbirthcontrol, and #cycletracking) that had collectively gained nearly 5bn views and 14.6m likes.</p> <p>They found that more than half of the video creators (53%) explicitly rejected hormonal birth control, and more than one in three (34%) expressed a distrust about healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, 38% endorsed fertility tracking, often without disclosing the limitations of this method.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/03/what-is-carnivore-diet-meat-benefits-science-does-work-why-so-many-influencers\">A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | Antiviral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White says the popularity of this kind of material is being driven by a number of factors: a wellness industry that often encourages women to not put anything unnatural in their bodies, a younger generation of women being increasingly sceptical of their doctors pushing pharmaceuticals, and a social media environment that rewards inflammatory statements and fear-based messaging. There is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/the-pill-hasnt-been-improved-in-years-no-wonder-women-are-giving-up-on-it\">conservative backlash against birth control.</a></p> <h2>Do ‘natural’ contraceptive methods work?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/contraception/fertility-awareness-based-methods-contraception-lactational\">Fertility awareness-based contraceptive methods</a> aim to identify the fertile window by tracking biomarkers for ovulation, such as basal body temperature and cervical mucus, to avoid a pregnancy. The method can be up to 99% effective when used correctly, but when it isn’t, almost one in four users will get pregnant over a year, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/natural-family-planning/\">according to the UK’s National Health Service.</a></p> <p>Prof Danielle Mazza, a practising GP and the head of Monash University’s department of general practice, says many women find it hard to determine when the fertile period of their cycle actually is. She says basal body temperature tracking is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/colossally-naive-backlash-birth-control-app\">not a good way to prevent pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>Even for women who have a very regular cycle and feel confident identifying their fertile window, the method still relies on several additional factors to work, she says. They have to be prepared to forego sex for considerable periods of time during the month, as well as spontaneity in their sex lives. They also have to have a partner who’s not coercive or violent, and they must make sure they don’t have sex when they’re inebriated or under the influence, Mazza says.</p> <h2>What about side effects of hormonal contraception?</h2> <p>Hormonal contraception is one of the most researched medications, Mazza says. “The majority of women can use these forms of medication very happily, with very few side-effects.”</p> <p>Known <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/side-effects-and-risks-of-hormonal-contraception/\">side-effects of hormonal birth control</a> include headaches, nausea, mood swings, weight gain, sore breasts and acne. However, social media can amplify individual negative experiences, with research showing young people in particular often believe that a lived experience is just as credible as advice from a trained professional, White says.</p> <p>If women are unhappy with the side-effects they are experiencing, Mazza encourages them to talk to their doctor rather than discarding contraception, because there are <a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/individuals/contraception\">different methods of effective contraception</a> that could suit them better. “It’s very important to come back for review, because also a lot of women can attribute symptoms to the pill or other hormonal forms of contraception, whereas there might be other reasons why they’re getting those kinds of symptoms.”</p> <p>Mazza also highlights that some side-effects can be transient. For example, breast tenderness or feelings of fullness when you start the pill are common, but usually subside within a few months. She says she does not know of any research to prove claims that women are attracted to men they wouldn’t be attracted to if they were off the pill.</p> <h2>What do experts recommend?</h2> <p>Dr Caroline de Moel-Mandel, the lead author of the La Trobe University study and a GP, says women often feel they aren’t listened to in clinical settings. As a result, if they feel pressed into accepting a particular contraceptive method, they might search for an alternative or talk about it and seek validation online from women who feel the same way, “and it becomes a cycle”.</p> <p>“The platform offers women a space to talk about their side-effects, or their distrust or their frustrations that they have with the pill, or maybe even with the consultations that they had with their doctors,” Moel-Mandel says.</p> <p>“Women need to be part of that decision-making process,” with their own lived experience being validated alongside their doctor’s medical perspective, she says. Other barriers, such as appointments being too expensive, also need to be addressed.</p> <p>White also emphasises that data shows – at least in the Australian context – that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/27/australian-women-lagging-on-use-of-iuds-due-to-education-failure-experts-say\">level of knowledge around contraception is very low</a>. Many women are worried about short- and long-term side-effects of hormonal contraception. As a result, she says, there is “a concerning level of unintended pregnancy”.</p> <p>“Being able to choose when to get pregnant is really, really, really critical for a woman’s health and her economic security.” But White stresses that “you can’t make an informed choice if you’re being misled.”</p> <p>• Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral</a> is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"bb8fc08d-d44b-4ccf-9d6c-c259975cf0a5\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>",

    "description": "<p>Survey of 12,000 women also revealed severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across menstrual cycle</p>",
    "content": "<p>Women with long Covid are prone to longer, heavier periods, which could put them at greater risk of iron deficiency that exacerbates common symptoms of the condition, doctors say.</p> <p>The findings emerged from a UK survey of more than 12,000 women, which also found that the severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across the menstrual cycle and became worse when women had their periods.</p> <p>Preliminary tests revealed hormonal changes and excessive inflammation of the womb lining in women with long Covid, but more work is needed to establish the knock-on effects. There was no evidence that long Covid harmed ovary function.</p> <p>The work points to a two-way effect, with long Covid affecting women’s periods and hormonal changes over the menstrual cycle affecting the severity of long Covid symptoms.</p> <p>“Our hope is that this will allow us to develop really specific treatments for women with long Covid who are suffering with menstrual disturbance,” said Dr Jacqueline Maybin, a reader and honorary consultant gynaecologist at the University of Edinburgh. “It may also lead to female-specific treatments for long Covid itself, which we know can be quite prevalent in women of reproductive age.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6\">estimated 400 million people</a> worldwide either have long Covid or have recovered from the condition. Nearly 2 million people in England alone self-report as living with long Covid, defined as symptoms that persist for at least four weeks after catching the virus.</p> <p>Doctors have recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/15/long-covid-has-more-than-200-symptoms-study-finds\">more than 200 long Covid symptoms</a>, but the most common include fatigue, brain fog, difficulty breathing, digestive issues, headaches and changes to smell and taste. The ailments appear to be driven by an array of problems, from residual infection and ongoing inflammation to disruption of the immune system and mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cells.</p> <p>Maybin and her colleagues analysed data from 12,187 UK women who completed an online survey between March and May 2021. More than 1,000 had long Covid, while more than 1,700 had recovered from the virus. More than 9,400 had never tested positive for Covid.</p> <p>Women with long Covid had longer, heavier periods and more bleeding between their periods than other women, the researchers found. A follow-up survey with 54 women revealed that the severity of their symptoms fluctuated over the menstrual cycle and worsened in the two days before and during their periods.</p> <p>The researchers went on to analyse blood from 10 women with long Covid. Tests revealed inflammation in the womb lining and higher-than-usual levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone. Both could be drivers of heavier periods.</p> <p>Importantly, according to the study in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62965-7\">Nature Communications</a>, the tests found no evidence that long Covid harmed the normal functioning of the ovaries.</p> <p>Many women of child-bearing age are iron-deficient, and heavy periods often contribute to the issue. This leads to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness, all of which are common in long Covid. “If you have long Covid on top of iron deficiency, it’s unsurprising that these women are really debilitated and unable to function,” Maybin said.</p> <p>Dr Viki Male, who studies reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said inflammation in the uterus was associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, so this could be the link between long Covid and prolonged or heavy periods. “Anti-inflammatory drugs are already used to treat heavy periods, so these findings suggest they might also be helpful for people who experience heavy menstrual bleeding as a symptom of long Covid,” she said.</p>",

In the traditional knockout format, only first, second and third are guaranteed a place in the next round, requiring Gout to be at or near his best to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">make sure his senior major debut lasts more than one race</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">‘A nobody who became really good’: Gout Gout takes his bow on the world stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The field is led by Bryan Levell, who last month recorded the third quickest 200m time in the rich history of Jamaican sprinting, behind only Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake. His 19.69sec into a slight headwind in Budapest elevated him into the medal conversation in Tokyo. But he has been consistent since winning Jamaica’s national title in June, including two sub 20.30sec runs in overseas meets before his breakout time in August.</p> \n<p>With his upright, robotic style, the 21-year-old Levell shot away early in that race in Hungary, and running inside Gout on Wednesday he is expected to heap pressure on the teenager from straight out of the blocks.</p> \n<p>Higher than Levell on the world rankings, Zimbabwean Makanakaishe Charamba made the 200m final in Paris last year. He may have finished last that day, but the 23-year-old has taken a step forward in 2025, and now has a personal best of 19.92sec which he has run twice this year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\" data-alt=\"Table showing the runners and best times in Gout Gout's 200m heat at the 2025 World Athletics Championships\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Israeli sprinter Blessing Afrifah is the only other one in the heat to have run sub-20sec and will be looking at Gout as a rival for a semi-final place.

Afrifah has struggled to go as quickly since, but his season best of 20.31sec suggests he will be in contention to make it through.</p> \n<p>Although Gout needs to finish in the top three to secure a direct place in the semi-finals, a quick fourth place is likely to get him through as one of the six next fastest qualifiers. A time of 20.44sec was enough to make the semis in Budapest. The slowest Gout has run over 200m this year was a 20.30sec at the Maurie Plant meet in his first race against adults.</p> \n<p>On that chilly Melbourne night in March, Lachie Kennedy beat him to the line in front of a capacity crowd at Lakeside.

    "content": "<p>Isn’t it funny how ingredients have entirely different connotations depending on your context?</p> <p>In the Anglosphere, cottage cheese is mid-century diet food. Served with grapefruit halves, joyless and tasteless. Richard Nixon’s last White House meal: tinned pineapple slices with an ice-cream scoop of cottage cheese and a glass of milk. Yikes.</p> <p>Yet in eastern Europe, farmhouse cheeses like cottage cheese and quark are staple inclusions that have nothing to do with weight loss fads. To me, it’s stained with sour cherry jam and washed down with Babushka’s black tea “zavarka” in a saucer. It’s bulking out the filling of Mum’s khachapuri. And, if I’m lucky, it means syrniki – AKA tvorozhniki for breakfast – using up any old dairy in the fridge, but especially cottage cheese, to make our version of ricotta hotcakes.</p>    <p>Of course, context can change over time too; and even western palates are growing fond of this fresh fromage. Cottage cheese has become a feature of some of this year’s most viral recipes, from protein-packed super bowls to two-ingredient GF wraps (the other ingredient is eggs). As a result, many countries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/07/cottage-cheese-shortage-australia-tiktok-viral-recipes\">experiencing shortages</a>.</p> <p>Luckily, there are plenty of uninitiated folk who are seeing the cottage cheese shelf empty and wandering off, without giving a quick glance nearby to find its kissing cousin: quark! Say it like the sound a posh duck would make.</p> <p>While they’re both fresh cheeses, quark and cottage cheese are made quite differently. Some cottage cheese is cultured to help it set, but it’s more likely to be acidified with vinegar or lemon juice like ricotta. There can be a lot of variation between brands and styles of cottage cheese, depending on where you are in the world.</p>    <p>As this product has traditionally been relegated to the “diet” section of western supermarkets, it’s often made using skim or low-fat milk, which can affect the flavour and make the texture a little more watery. Rather than seeking out a low-fat label like it’s 1985, look for the cheese with the fewest ingredients, keeping an eye out for additions like thickeners and gums, as well as flavourings and salt content.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <p>Quark is always made with Lactobacillus cultures, like yoghurt, along with microbial rennet (as you would for other cheeses). As a result quark changes more in texture and flavour, depending on the season and the milk. I spoke with one of my favourite quark suppliers and they said: “Because we pasteurise low and slow and unhomogenised, our quark is generally smooth – but being small-batch and seasonal, it can change depending on the milk, the weather and, yes, who’s on the tools that day.”</p>    <p>You can probably guess which product is my pick, though you can pretty reliably sub one in for the other the next time you’re inspired to try a “cottage cheese hack” from the internet – including in this recipe. The only difference you might find is that low-fat cottage cheese can get a little weepy and split due to all the thickeners and gums going goopy under heat, so in those recipes, low real estate labels and/or quark are your friend.</p> <p>For this recipe, I’m taking inspiration from the sweet syrniki Mum makes for breakfast and the savoury pelmeni Dad makes for dinner (bought frozen from the shops then pumped up with caramelised onion, sour cream and dill).</p>    <p>I’ve kept the syrniki super light by treating them more like ricotta gnudi, shaping them, then letting them sit on the gluten-free flour until they form a skin. Because it’s gluten free, you don’t have to worry about overworking the gluten, which means you can really ensure that the ingredients are evenly mixed together. With a diligent fry on either side, the batter then sets while the inside stays tender. The golden onion slices (sweated down low and slow until they change colour) are enriched with sour cream for a simple sweet-savoury-tangy sauce that brings everything together.</p>    <p>Cracked caraway is the surprise hero here, taking these from a simple breakfast stack to a sophisticated dinner dumpling, with notes of Borodinsky rye. Mind you, that’s just my frame of reference. My home economist Jane Grylls visited when we were cooking these and described the eating experience as “Russian dimmies” (that’s dim sum for those outside Australia) because they’re so savoury and satisfying. If you can’t find caraway seeds, fennel seeds will give you a similar enough vibe to save a trip to the shops.</p>    <p>These can be made in advance and reheated to serve, or eaten cold for brunch al desko, so you can nix the paltry pineapple slices and blob of bland forever.</p> <h2>Savoury syrniki with caraway and caramelised onion – recipe</h2>    <p>Serves: <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>40g butter</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>1 brown onion</strong>, thinly sliced into half-moons against the grain<br><strong>½ tsp caraway seeds, </strong>or fennel seeds, crushed<br><strong>¼ tsp salt flakes<br>1 egg<br>500g quark</strong> (or full-fat cottage cheese)<br><strong>100g gluten-free self-raising flour, </strong>50g for the syrniki and 50g for dusting<br><strong>300g sour cream<br>¼ bunch of dill, fronds picked, stems finely chopped<br>Freshly ground white pepper</strong></p> <p>In a wide, heavy-based pan, melt the butter and oil together, then pop in the onion (along with a pinch of sugar if you’re that way inclined) and listen for the sizzle on medium heat. Once you hear the sizzle, drop the heat to medium-low and whack a lid on, along with a timer for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Crush your caraway seeds with the salt in a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, pop the seeds and salt in the base of a large mixing bowl and use the bottom of a bottle (like wine or olive oil) for crushing.</p> <p>Mix together the crushed seeds and salt, along with the egg, quark and 50g of flour.</p> <p>On a medium sized tray sprinkle over the other 50g of flour. Use two tablespoons to blob out walnut-in-shell-sized amounts of batter into the flour, shaking it about to coat them. Leave them on the tray for five to 10 minutes to keep soaking up more starch while you wait for the onion to caramelise (this’ll help them form a crust).</p> <p>Once the onion has fried and turned golden brown with little flecks of caramelisation on the tips, pull it out into a bowl, trying to keep as much oil and butter in the pan as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/11/alice-zaslavskys-crisp-topped-tuna-nicoise-mornay-tuna-pasta-bake-recipe\">Alice Zaslavsky’s crisp-topped tuna niçoise mornay (tuna pasta bake) – recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If need be, add another knob of butter and oil as you go, and fry the batter balls for three to four minutes each side on a medium heat until browned top and bottom.</p> <p>Pull the dumplings out of the pan on to a lined tray and pop a tea towel on top to keep them warm but not schvitzy.</p> <p>To finish the sauce, wipe any gunky bits out of the pan, then pop the caramelised onions back in on a low heat, stirring through the dill stalks, most of the sour cream and a good helping of freshly ground white pepper.

It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favour and stand up for journalists’ first amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”</p> <p>The suit makes a series of verbose claims about Trump’s achievements, wealth and skill on the television show The Apprentice. It claims he secured “the greatest personal and political achievement in American history” with his election win, while accusing the NYT of trying to damage his “worldwide reputation for success”.</p> <p>It states The Apprentice was a success because of “President Trump’s sui generis charisma and unique business acumen”. It describes his father, Fred C Trump, as “a legendary businessman and a patriot”.</p> <p>“Thereafter, President Trump’s stewardship of the Trump Organization has made it and the Trump name synonymous not only with New York City real estate but also with worldwide excellence, luxury, and opulence,” it states, taking issue with the NYT’s reporting of his business dealings.</p> <p>The suit accuses the NYT, as well as other “legacy media” regarded as opponents, of engaging in election interference. It points to the paper’s decision to endorse the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the last presidential race.</p> <p>The NYT made the endorsement while other major outlets took the unusual move of refusing to endorse a candidate in the race. The Washington Post, owned by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, opted against endorsing a candidate. That decision was criticised by some as an attempt to appease Trump and led to a backlash among subscribers and Post employees.</p> <p>The case against the NYT is just the latest of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits Trump has launched against US media outlets since his return to the White House.</p> <p>Lawsuits have been brought against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million\">ABC News and the anchor George Stephanopoulos</a>, as well as Paramount over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris\">60 Minutes interview with Harris</a>. Those cases were settled for $15m and $16m respectively. The case against the Wall Street Journal is ongoing.</p> <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump denounced the NYT as “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party”.</p> <p>“I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER,” he said, though he did not provide any evidence for the claim. “Their Endorsement of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!</p> <p>“The ‘Times’ has engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation as a whole.”</p> <p>The lawsuit cites articles in the NYT based on Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, a book by the reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner.</p> <p>“Defendants maliciously published the book and the articles knowing that these publications were filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump,” the filing states. Penguin Random House, the publisher of the book, which is also being sued as part of the action, has not yet commented on the suit.</p> <p>Articles in the NYT to be cited in the filing include one published before the November election, which was described as an “election-interfering salvo”. The suit says the articles were part of a long-term pattern of “intentional and malicious defamation”. It seeks damages of “not less than $15bn”.</p> <p>Trump’s team has previously filed a libel suit against the NYT in relation to an opinion article concerning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/trump-campaign-sues-new-york-times-for-libel-over-russia-story\">Russian interference in the 2016 US election</a>. It was dismissed on the grounds of “protected speech”.</p> <p>Trump also has sued the newspaper and his estranged niece over a 2018 story about his family’s wealth and tax arrangements, describing it as an “insidious plot” to obtain his records. A New York judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/donald-trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-mary-trump\">threw out the case</a> in 2023.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lauren Choi wanted to give plastic a second life. Her experiment turned into The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.</p> <p>But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019, during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw material.</p> <p>Choi then took a weaving class at a Baltimore, Maryland, maker space so she could make a sample fabric out of those filaments. That became the foundation for The New Norm, a textile company that today transforms a variety of post-consumer recycled plastic into stylish sweatshirts and beanies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/modernize-trade-trumps-tariffs\">At 23, she set out to modernize the spice trade. Now she’s navigating Trump’s tariffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’ve always thought long-term,” Choi said. “And that helps me look beyond the next couple years, [to the] bigger picture, where globally, [the plastic crisis] is something we need to address.”</p> <p>The company is a natural extension of Choi’s longstanding concern about the dual climate and plastics crises and a deep connection to fashion. She had been sewing since she was a child, interned at a swimwear company earlier in college, and – before teaming up with classmates – spent a summer trying to build an extruder machine in her parents’ garage. “[The New Norm] really tied my interests together,” she said.</p> <p>After graduating in 2020, Choi raised grant funding so she could dive more into product development. “That helped it go from a passion project to a real, real project,” she said.</p>    <p>Choi started working with suppliers who source plastics from recycling facilities across the country. “Recycled [materials are] still the wild west,” she said. “We received batches that were unusable or contaminated or too mixed. It was a lot of trial and error to find the right people.”</p> <p>Another challenge: Up until that point, the fabric coming out of the extruder still had a distinctly brittle, plastic feel – it didn’t feel wearable like a traditional textile. So Choi reached out to Gaston College’s Textile Technology Center, just outside Charlotte, North Carolina, for help.</p> <p>“If you’re going to produce a knit garment, it needs to be comfortable,” said Jasmine Cox, the center’s executive director. “It needs to be breathable, cozy, things that people love. It can’t feel like a plastic cup.”</p> <p>Cox’s team, along with people at the Polymers Center in North Carolina, helped Choi develop a custom formula that could be fed into extruders to produce soft textiles. “Our entire goal [was] to get her to that point where it was plug and play,” Cox said.</p> <p>It took them a couple years, and more grant funding (from Johns Hopkins, Garnier, and Reynolds Consumer Products, Hefty’s parent company, among others), to get to that point. The New Norm released its first, direct-to-consumer collection of sweaters and beanies in late 2023. Made from 5,000 upcycled party cups, the drop sold out in two months.</p> <p>Choi works with textile facilities in North Carolina and Virginia to produce The New Norm’s yarn, much of which is then shipped to Brooklyn, where a manufacturer uses 3D printers to produce sweatshirts and beanies, which retail between $45 and $85.</p> <p>“3D knitting has a lot less waste compared to traditional cut-and-sew, where many fabric scraps are wasted,” Choi said. “Instead, our pieces are knit straight out of the machine without any seams – it’s just one full garment that doesn’t need additional sewing.”</p>    <p>Even though the company now uses a variety of plastics, multicolored party cups still make up most of the raw materials in its own line. The items’ pink, blue and green pastel hues come from the cups themselves rather than added dyes. Choi said her yarn is made from continuous filaments, rather than fibers that are spun together, which means it’s less likely to shed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know\">harmful microplastics</a>.</p> <p>The New Norm is still a lean operation: Choi, who recently moved to Boston to pursue an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said at any given time there are between three and 25 people working at the company. She declined to share sales figures, but said that in the last two years production had expanded from tens of pounds per run to thousands.</p> <p>Choi said she aims to expand the business-to-business side of The New Norm, which she sees as offering the biggest opportunity for an environmental impact.</p> <p>“From the beginning, our goal has been to get to a place where we can scale production and work with really large brands who are using significant quantities of materials,” she said. The New Norm is undergoing pilots with large brands, testing everything from the strength of the yarn to how well it launders, with the goal of developing and selling the material at a much larger scale.</p> <p>This aligns with where some experts see the industry going, as a growing number of companies rethink where they source their raw materials. One <a href=\"https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/sustainable-fabrics-market-9619?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">report</a> found that the sustainable textile market was valued globally at $29.5bn in 2024, and is expected to hit $71bn by 2031. (While what constitutes “sustainable” is somewhat nebulous, most research defines it as textiles made with eco-friendly material, including recycled fibers, which minimize water, chemicals, and carbon emissions.)</p> <p>For her part, Choi hopes The New Norm can put a dent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns\">global plastics crisis</a>, which has reached disastrous levels. The world produces 200 times as much plastic today as it did in 1950, less than 10% of which is recycled. There’s an estimated 8bn tons of plastic pollution across the globe, and just three plastic chemicals cause as much as $1.5tn in annual health costs.</p> <p>Cox said Choi was early in terms of thinking about how to transform plastic into textile. And while there are other companies that turn plastic and textile waste into yarn, Cox said Choi’s focus on the party cup was unique, especially because of where it could lead. “Food containers, food packaging, that’s something that we don’t think about,” she said. “Everyone throws it out daily, and there haven’t been many solutions.”</p> <p>Some might question if we really want to be wearing clothes made out of plastic, but the reality is we already are. More than 60% of fibers produced worldwide are synthetic, the vast majority of which are derived from virgin fossil fuels, according to a 2024 report from <a href=\"https://2d73cea0.delivery.rocketcdn.me/app/uploads/2024/09/Materials-Market-Report-2024.pdf\">Textile Exchange</a>, making the fashion industry a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cox and Choi both acknowledged how much needs to be done to reduce plastic usage, but see upcycling as an important first step.</p> <p>“It would be amazing if we lived in a plastic-free world,” Choi said. “But if you look at the volume of virgin, synthetic fibers made annually, we’re talking billions of tons of material. There’s a long road to go.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The city of Birmingham lies just over 40 miles north-east of Ludlow, but to the 10,000 residents of the quiet Shropshire town, it may as well be on the moon.</p> <p>“You can’t get a bus to Birmingham today, it’s impossible. It is really just up the road, our big regional centre but there are no buses. How ridiculous is that?” said Philip Adams.</p> <p>Adams, who has lived in Ludlow for many years, remembers the bygone days of the poppy red buses of the Midland Red company toing and froing to Birmingham, until the publicly owned business was broken up in 1981 and sold off under Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation agenda.</p> <p>Today, Midland Red buses can only be found in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59827695\">transport museums</a>, and the route from Ludlow to Birmingham is most often done by car.</p> <p>Over the years since privatisation, bus companies in Shropshire have folded, risen and folded again, and the public service has collapsed.</p> <p>According to data from the thinktank Common Wealth, the county has suffered one of the biggest reductions in bus routes in the UK over the past six years, with a 60% reduction in kilometres travelled by bus.</p> <p>A survey of passenger experiences of Ludlow’s bus routes, conducted by the town’s sustainable transport group, revealed how people, particularly elderly residents, were suffering from this devastation of public transport.</p> <p>Confusing timetabling, long gaps of up to four hours between buses, and irregular service were all highlighted. “The accessibility of a regular town bus has practically been destroyed,” said one member of the public.</p> <p>According to Common Wealth’s research, the same picture is repeated across the country. Since privatisation, services have collapsed but bus and train ticket prices have risen above inflation every year since 1987.</p>    <p>More than £16bn has been paid in dividends to the owners of bus and train companies: £14.2bn since 1996 to the shareholders of the privatised train companies and £1.82bn for the shareholders of bus companies since 2007, according to Common Wealth.</p> <p>Since 2020 alone, at least £143m has been distributed to the shareholders of bus firms while the companies oversaw pre-tax losses of £53m.</p> <p>Taxpayers are shovelling money into the system to shore it up, with £2bn of additional public funding paid to bus operators in the past five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\" data-alt=\"Graphic shows bus fare rises compared with motoring costs\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Train companies are also receiving public money while handing out dividends. According to the Office of Road and Rail, the public paid £12.5bn in 2023-24 to subsidise rail companies – £4.1bn in net payments directly to operating companies and £8.3bn paid to Network Rail, which in turn further subsidises the operating companies indirectly.</p> <p>Direct and indirect subsidies to train companies enabled the operating companies and the rolling stock companies to run post-tax profits of £449m annually since the year ending March 2017.</p> <p>But much of these profits, Common Wealth says, were paid out in dividends rather than reinvested in services.</p> <p>Today getting a train from Ludlow to Birmingham is almost as difficult as spotting a bus on the route. It requires a detour 30 miles north to Shrewsbury, or 24 miles south to Hereford, to change trains for the Birmingham service.</p> <p>For passengers who use the CrossCountry trains from the south-west to Birmingham and beyond, the pain is evident. The company was ranked the worst in Britain this summer by Transport Focus, the independent watchdog for passengers, and only 41% of its services run on time.</p> <p>Ownership of the rail and bus sectors faces a shakeup by the Labour government. Train operating companies across the UK are being renationalised under the 2024 Passenger Railway Services Act, with Welsh and Scottish rail operators back in public ownership in 2021 and 2022 respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\" data-alt=\"Chart shows distance travelled by buses has reduce in 15 English local authorities\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said the rolling stock companies also needed to be returned to public ownership to ensure renationalisation led to a coherent and well-planned system.</p> <p>The bus sector is also facing an overhaul, with new legislation permitting the creation of local authority-owned bus companies once again and bringing fares, routes, timetables and connections back into public control.</p> <p>Public ownership of public transport is overwhelmingly popular. In 2024, YouGov found that 76% of the electorate backed public ownership of rail and 66% backed public ownership of bus services.</p> <p>“Passengers pay the price for privatisation through higher fares and cut-back services,” said Lawrence.</p> <p>“Public transport should be genuinely public. Money should be reinvested, not leak out the system. Vital services should be provided based on need not profit. And the fragmentation that leads to higher costs should be replaced by a coherent, public-oriented system.”</p> <p>As a member of Ludlow 21, a sustainable transport group in Shropshire, Adams agrees. “Privatisation has been a complete disaster for bus services. It just doesn’t work.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Framework deal is breakthrough in long-running dispute over app’s ownership amid security concerns in Washington</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jamieson Greer, a US trade representative, said on Monday that Washington and Beijing have struck a framework agreement on transferring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> to US-controlled ownership.</p> <p>Speaking after emerging from negotiations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">Chinese</a> officials, Scott Bessent said the deal was coming but declined to reveal the commercial terms.</p> <p>“We have a framework for a TikTok deal,” the treasury secretary told reporters after coming out of high-level talks in Madrid. “We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” Bessent added that the Chinese team had made “aggressive asks” during negotiations, but did not explain what they were.</p> <p>Li Chenggang, the top Chinese trade negotiator, confirmed later on Monday that two sides had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting trade. Li said friction between the two economic giants was normal, but warned Washington against continued “suppression” of Chinese companies.</p> <p>“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are hard won, and the US side should not, on the one hand, ask China to accommodate its concerns, whilst at the same time continue to suppress Chinese companies,” Li said in Madrid.</p> <p>The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/24/why-is-us-threatening-to-ban-tiktok-and-could-other-countries-follow-suit\">Joe Biden signed legislation</a> that gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/19/third-tiktok-ban-extension-trump\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/tik-tok-ban-trump-extension\">extended</a>.</p> <p>The US is estimated to have over <a href=\"https://analyzify.com/statsup/tiktok\">135 million active users</a> on the platform, including the White House, which launched its own official account in August, despite the fact that government devices themselves are <a href=\"https://digitalpolicyalert.org/change/4280-no-tiktok-on-government-devices-act\">still prohibited</a> from using the app under federal law.</p> <p>TikTok briefly went dark in January when the ban took effect, displaying messages that the app was unavailable under US law. Trump reversed the shutdown within hours of taking office, signing an executive order to delay enforcement for 75 days before extending the deadline again and again. Apple and Google had removed TikTok from their app stores during the brief blackout but restored access after government assurances they would face no penalties.</p> <p>Washington’s security concerns center on fears that Beijing could manipulate the massively popular platform to spy on Americans or influence public opinion. Christopher Wray, the former FBI director, <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2023/03/08/fbi-director-warns-senate-of-chinese-control-over-tiktok-data/\">warned senators</a> that China’s national security laws could compel ByteDance to hand over user data or suppress content, and the Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, abortion and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-censorship-us-data-240e11d9bb6212b0c9b1adab821e5005\">according to court documents</a>.</p> <p>Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ devices.</p> <p>The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential acquisition worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-says-failed-tiktok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-worked-on-2021-09-28/\">the strangest deal</a>” he has ever worked on.</p> <p>Soon after, Walmart and Oracle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/10/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-and-walmart-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-say-reports\">came close</a> to buying TikTok’s US arm, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.</p> <p>Oracle has remained <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">TikTok’s US cloud provider</a> since 2022 in a deal aimed at addressing security concerns.</p> <p>Bessent said final details would be settled when Trump speaks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, on Friday. Trump hinted that the deal was in the making while all sides were still at the table, posting on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115208260926006345\">Truth Social</a> that “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much want to save. They will be very happy!”</p> <p>Greer confirmed that the agreement was now awaiting approval from both leaders.</p> <p>“We’re not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Two parents who caused the death of their newborn baby after taking her to live in a tent in wintry conditions to evade social services have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon went off the grid in late 2022; their four older children had previously been taken into care due to concerns for their safety if left with the couple.</p> \n<p>A jury in their Old Bailey retrial unanimously found them guilty of manslaughter in July. In their first trial last year, the defendants had also been convicted of perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child and child cruelty.</p> \n<p>Sentencing them on Monday, Judge Lucraft KC told them: “It is clear … neither of you gave much or any thought for the care or love for your baby.”</p> \n<p>The judge said they had displayed “arrogance”, adding: “What you did towards baby Victoria can only be described as neglect; neglect of the gravest and most serious type.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jul/15/inside-the-trial-of-constance-marten-and-mark-gordon\">‘A relentless, destructive energy’: inside the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There has been no genuine expression of remorse from either of you.”</p> \n<p>While he said they had expressed sadness, they had “adopted the stance of trying to blame everyone else”.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Lucraft, the recorder of London, jailed the pair for 14 years and handed Gordon a further four years on extended licence.</p> \n<p>Speaking after the trial, DCI Joanna Yorke of the Met police, who led the homicide investigation, said: “The selfish actions of Mark Gordon and Constance Marten resulted in the death of an innocent newborn baby who would have recently had her second birthday and should have had the rest of her life ahead of her.”</p> \n<p>Jaswant Narwal, the chief crown prosecutor, said the couple had “used different antics to frustrate and delay court proceedings”, adding: “No child should have had its life cut short in this preventable way. I hope today’s sentences provide a sense of justice and comfort to all those affected by this tragic case.”</p> \n<p>During the sentencing hearing, the judge repeatedly reprimanded Marten and Gordon for their “disruptive” behaviour in the dock as their lawyers were mitigating for them. He threatened to have them removed from the court, and to continue the hearing without them if necessary, labelling their behaviour “disrespectful”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2269053e-735d-4a02-a068-d3cd7061a45f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nA7tXJaRVVg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jurors in the first trial were not told about Gordon’s violent past, which was partly revealed only in their second trial. Lucraft listed this among aggravating factors when passing sentence.</p> \n<p>Gordon and Marten spent seven weeks on the run before they were found by police in Brighton, East Sussex.</p> \n<p>Officers had launched a nationwide hunt after finding the couple’s burnt-out car on a motorway near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on 5 January 2023. In it was evidence that the baby, Victoria, had been born shortly beforehand.</p> \n<p>The couple travelled across England in taxis with the newborn; eventually ending up in the countryside near Brighton.</p> \n<p>After a search by police, Victoria’s body was found amid rubbish inside a Lidl bag in a disused shed. Her remains were too badly decomposed to establish the cause of death.</p> \n<p>The prosecution said she had died from hypothermia in the cold and damp conditions inside the flimsy tent, or was smothered. The defendants claimed their daughter’s death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep on her.</p> \n<p>In 1989, Gordon, then 14, held a woman against her will in Florida for more than four hours, and raped her while armed with a knife and hedge clippers. Within a month, he entered another property and carried out another offence involving aggravated battery.</p> \n<p>Gordon, who moved with his mother from Birmingham to the US at the age of 12, was sentenced to 40 years in jail and released after 22 years.</p> \n<p>Jurors in the retrial appeared shaken by the revelations – even though Marten had revealed Gordon’s rape conviction while giving evidence.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Gordon was convicted of assaulting two female police officers at a maternity unit in Wales, where Marten gave birth to their first child under a fake identity.</p> \n<p>Jurors were told Marten had been warned by social workers about the risk of falling asleep with a baby lying on her and that a tent was unsuitable.</p> \n<p>Both defendants gave evidence in their retrial but each cut short their testimony before they could be cross-examined by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>Marten and Gordon were told they would serve two-thirds of their 14-year custodial terms behind bars. And they were told they would then be released to serve the remaining time on licence. In Gordon’s case, the latter period included the extra four years handed down because of the danger he was deemed to pose.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Paul McCartney, Kate Bush and Elton John among creatives arguing that Labour’s AI proposals could result in ‘an artist’s life work to be stolen’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Leading British artists including Mick Jagger, Kate Bush and Paul McCartney have urged Keir Starmer to stand up for creators’ human rights and protect their work ahead of a UK-US tech deal during Donald Trump’s visit.</p> <p>In a letter to the prime minister, they argued Labour had failed to defend artists’ basic rights by blocking attempts to force artificial intelligence firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.</p> <p>Senior figures in US tech are accompanying the US president on his state visit, where an announcement is expected on a UK-US tech pact covering areas including AI.</p> <p>Elton John, one of the letter’s signatories, said government proposals to let AI companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/why-are-creatives-fighting-uk-government-ai-proposals-on-copyright\">train their systems</a> on copyright-protected work without permission “leaves the door wide open for an artist’s life work to be stolen”.</p> <p>“We will not accept this,” he added. “And we will not let the government forget their election promises to support our creative industries.”</p> <p>Other signatories include Annie Lennox, the writer Antonia Fraser, and the actor and playwright Kwame Kwei Armah. Creative organisations backing the letter include the News Media Association, which represents news publishers including the Guardian’s owner the Guardian Media Group, the Society of London Theatre &amp; UK Theatre, and Mumsnet. There are more than 70 signatories in total.</p> <p>The letter claims that copyright law is being flouted “en masse” by tech companies to build AI models and raises the government’s refusal to accept amendments to the recent data (use and access) bill that would have forced AI firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.</p> <p>Such a move “actively stood in the way” of creators exercising their human rights, the letter adds, referring to the UN’s international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights (ICESCR), the Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the European convention on human rights – the latter enforceable in the UK through the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The letter points to a provision in the ECHR stating that “no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest”, adding that removing the amendments breached UK citizens’ rights, under the ICESCR, to “the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is author”.</p> <p>“The government’s formal position has exhibited a shocking indifference to mass theft, and a complete unwillingness to enforce the existing law to uphold the human rights stipulated by the ICESCR, the Berne Convention and the ECHR,” said the letter.</p> <p>Labour has been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning\">loggerheads with the UK’s creative community</a> ever since launching a consultation on reforming copyright law, with the preferred option of letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless they signal a desire to opt out of the process. The government has said this is no longer its preferred option and has convened working groups – drawn from the creative and AI sectors – to come up with solutions to the issue.</p> <p>Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/uk-copyright-law-consultation-fixed-favour-ai-firms-peer-says\">who tabled the data bill amendments</a>, said the working groups were “packed” with US interests – members include ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta – and pointed to recent government deals with Google and OpenAI as evidence of a continuing close relationship with US tech. Kidron said failure to protect copyright contravened artists’ human rights.</p> <p>“It’s deeply regrettable that it has come to this, but by prioritising the short-term optics of data centre announcements and trade deals, they are knowingly undermining the foundations of the UK’s creative industries,” said Lady Kidron.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said the the creative industries’ concerns over copyright were being taken “seriously” and a report into the impact of potential changes would be published by the end of March next year.</p> <p>“No decisions have been taken, but our focus is on both supporting rights holders and creatives, while making sure AI models can be trained on high-quality material in the UK,” said the spokesperson.</p>",

    "description": "<p>‘Nato is responding with unity and strength’ to Russian threats, says John Healey</p>",
    "content": "<p>RAF Typhoon jets will be deployed within days to shoot down drones over Poland and other Nato allies in eastern Europe if necessary, after last week’s incursion of 19 uncrewed Russian aircraft into Poland.</p> <p>The British fighters, based at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, will join Nato’s new Eastern Sentry mission working alongside French, German and Danish counterparts who are acting as reinforcements for Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s.</p> <p>John Healey, the defence secretary, said Nato was “responding with unity and strength” to the threats and that Typhoons would be ready to attack Russian drones flying over Nato countries if required to do so.</p> <p>“If you’ve got drones that are putting Polish lives at risk, then Nato will take the action to take them out,” Healey said, adding the Typhoons were part of a broader mission “to defend Nato airspace”.</p> <p>The minister was speaking during a visit to an unused industrial site in Swindon where Tekever, a drone manufacturer, is planning to build a factory, invest up to £400m and create hundreds of jobs supplying reconnaissance drones to European militaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/romania-reports-russian-drone-in-its-airspace-as-poland-scrambles-jets-again\">Romania says Russian drone incursions pose ‘new challenge’ to Black Sea security</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the weekend, Romania became the second Nato ally in eastern Europe to detect a Russian drone crossing into its airspace in a week – and Healey said the Typhoons mission would extend operations to the country if deemed necessary.</p> <p>He said: “They are deployed as part of the Nato Eastern Sentry air policing. What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato. That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”</p> <p>Last Wednesday, 19 unarmed Russian drones crossed the border into Poland as part of a broader attack on Ukraine, prompting Nato to scramble jets and activate Patriot air defence systems in a major defensive operation.</p> <p>Though there were no casualties, only three or four of the drones were shot down, raising questions about the effectiveness of western air defences. In response, Nato’s military commander called for an increase in the number of fighter jets available for air policing.</p> <p>On Friday, Nato leaders announced the creation of Operation Eastern Sentry, a plan to better protect the skies over alliance members in eastern Europe, starting with Poland. The alliance’s most senior military chief, Gen Alexus Grynkewich, said Nato was “bringing additional resources to bear” in the effort.</p> <p>The US, however, has not announced any additional commitments, in line with previous statements made by Donald Trump and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that European members of Nato are expected to take the lead on defending the continent against Russian aggression and spillover from the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, the former chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said that he and Healey had met Hegseth in Brussels in March and were told with “incredible clarity” that “America is focusing more on the Indo Pacific and its homeland security and that would mean that Europe would have to do more and take more responsibility”.</p> <p>Healey said the Typhoons would be “operational and involved within days”. Though based in Lincolnshire, from where it takes about 90 minutes to reach Poland, they are supported by a dedicated Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft, allowing them to prolong their missions if necessary.</p> <p>The British effort would be supported by 400 military personnel in the UK, the minister added. “It’s not just a few planes in the air, it’s a significant operation, part of a much bigger Nato exercise on the eastern flank,” Healey said.</p> <p>There was no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate. Healey said: “There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point. It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.</p>",

The latest data makes it even less likely that the Bank’s monetary policy committee will cut rates this week.</p> <p>While wage growth remains higher than the Bank believes is consistent with meeting its inflation target, however, it will not feel that way for workers.</p> <p>With inflation on the rise again, pushed up by food prices and energy bills, the ONS calculates that real wages are just 1% higher than a year ago – or 0.5% once housing costs are taken into account.</p> <p>That is likely to mean that many consumers continue to feel the pinch, despite Labour’s stated determination to ensure economic growth can be felt in workers’ pockets.</p> <p>As Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation thinktank, put it: “The combination of stagnant living standards and sticky inflation means that people are still likely to feel pessimistic about their household finances one year into the new parliament.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The unique Scottish verdict of not proven, long considered a global legal anomaly, could be scrapped this week as the Holyrood parliament votes on the country’s most radical shake-up of criminal justice in decades.</p> <p>Scotland is the only country in the world to offer juries the not proven verdict alongside guilty and not guilty, a poorly defined historical oddity that dates back to the 18th century.</p> <p>The verdict acquits an accused person but stops short of finding them not guilty, and is believed to be a key factor in Scotland’s markedly lower convictions rate for rape and sexual assault cases.</p> <p>Before the final vote on the Scottish government’s <a href=\"https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/s6/victims-witnesses-and-justice-reform-scotland-bill\">victims, witnesses and justice reform bill</a>, which includes a suite of reforms to improve the criminal justice system for survivors of rape and sexual violence, the Rape Crisis Scotland chief executive, Sandy Brindley, described it as “a once-in-a-generation opportunity”.</p> <p>A lengthy debate is anticipated on Tuesday after the SNP government and opposition MSPs tabled more than 160 amendments to the bill, which has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/jury-less-trials-rapists-scotland-nicola-sturgeon\">faced significant opposition</a> from the highest echelons of the legal profession since it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/26/scottish-ministers-publish-radical-plan-to-overhaul-handling-of-sexual-offences\">first published in 2023</a>.</p>    <p>Speaking before the final vote by MSPs, which is expected by Wednesday, the justice secretary, Angela Constance, said: “This landmark bill will put victims and witnesses at the heart of the justice system, while continuing to protect the rights of the accused.”</p> <p>As well as scrapping not proven, described as “a necessity for modern justice” by Kate Wallace, the chief executive of Victim Support Scotland, the measures include reforming the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction, establishing a specialist sexual offences court, and enshrining in Scots law the right to lifelong anonymity for rape complainers (the Scottish legal term for complainants).</p> <p>It will also establish a victims and witnesses commissioner and provide an automatic right to publicly funded, independent legal representation for complainers to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history.</p> <p>The bill has already been substantially amended, dropping a proposal to pilot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/31/scottish-pilot-of-jury-less-court-cases-dropped-after-backlash-from-lawyers\">juryless trials in rape cases</a> that had attracted widespread condemnation, with lawyers’ associations throughout Scotland balloting to join a near-unanimous boycott of the scheme.</p> <p>And on Monday, the<strong> </strong>Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland told the Scotsman they continued to have concerns about the proposal to increase jury majorities from a simple majority to two-thirds, and how that would act in conjunction with the abolition of not proven, warning it could “cheapen the guilty verdict”.</p> <p>Brindley likewise suggested this could mean Scotland’s “terrifyingly low” conviction rates for sexual assault would drop even lower, given research highlighting juries’ reluctance to convict rape cases.</p> <p>Miss M has campaigned for the abolition of the third verdict since winning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/05/scottish-civil-court-rules-that-acquitted-man-did-student\">landmark civil action</a> after the criminal case against the man she accused of raping her on a university freshers’ week night out was found not proven.</p> <p>Urging MSPs to consider the “harrowing” impact of not proven, she said: “Together survivors and their families have shared their experiences of being failed by a not proven verdict.

    "content": "<p>Too often economists reduce important issues, like prosperity, to a narrow set of indicators such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/australian-economy-households-spending-more-helping-momentum-weak-growth\">gross domestic product</a> to measure national progress.</p> <p>Anything that boosts GDP is good, right?</p> <p>Well, no, of course not. Growing the size of the economy while wrecking the environment or making people miserable is no step forward.</p> <p>So a number of countries around the world – including the UK, Canada and New Zealand – have introduced alternative ways to measure wellbeing that goes “beyond GDP”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Treasury, under the direction of Jim Chalmers, established the “Measuring What Matters” framework in 2023 to track our progress towards “a more healthy, secure, sustainable, cohesive and prosperous Australia”.</p> <p>Here’s a selection from each theme as laid out in the ABS’s latest update on the Measuring What Matters indicators, which pulls information from various sources to paint a wider picture of Australia’s progress.</p> <h2>Healthy</h2> <p>Costs and waiting times are key factors when it comes to how easy it is for people to access healthcare.</p> <p>The Measuring What Matters report shows access has become more difficult on both counts over the past decade, and especially since the pandemic.</p> <p>The share of patients who said they waited longer than they felt was acceptable to see a GP has climbed from 16.6% in 2020-21 to 28% in 2023-24.</p> <p>When it came to delays getting a specialist appointment, the proportion who said they waited longer than acceptable was 29% in 2023-24, up from 22% three years earlier.</p> <p>And cost has also become a bigger barrier.</p> <p>In 2023-24, 9% of patients said they delayed seeing a GP due to the expense – more than triple the 2.4% share in 2020-21.</p> <p>And 10% said they delayed seeing a specialist for the same reason last year, compared with 5.9% a few years earlier.</p>  <figure

collective psyche, according to the report’s gauge of “national safety”, or “living peacefully and feeling safe”.</p> <p>In 2025, just over half of Australians reported feeling safe or very safe based on views of world events, the ABS said, versus 91% in 2005 and 80% a decade ago.</p> <p>“Since 2020, very low proportions of people have reported feeling very safe,” the ABS noted.</p>  <figure

the devastating potential impacts on Australia from climate change, the Measuring What Matters report shows net greenhouse gas emissions of 446.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024.</p> <p>That is 27% below emissions in the year to June 2005, which is the baseline year for our 2030 emission reduction target of 43%.</p> <p>Worryingly, there hasn’t been much progress in the 2020s.</p>

71% in 2024.</p> <p>Still, that remains higher than pre-pandemic levels broadly in the mid-60s and suggests we remain proud of our multiculturalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive

generally earning more over time.</p> <p>But a prosperous country isn’t just rich, it’s also equal – or at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/australian-workers-reaping-greater-share-national-income-than-before-pandemic\">not terribly unequal</a>.</p> <p>A recognised way of measuring equality is via the “Gini coefficient”, which can range between zero and one, where the lower the score the more equal the distribution.</p> <p>Australia’s latest Gini coefficient, based on the latest household, income and labour dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, is 0.307 in 2022-23 – a marked improvement from the year before but broadly equivalent to what it’s been over the past 20 years.</p> <p>That said, it’s still too early to judge whether the pandemic has made us more unequal, but the early signs are positive.</p> <p>In 2022 we had the 16th-highest level of income inequality among the 37 OECD countries for which data was available, the ABS said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

    "content": "<p>Downing Street has condemned Elon Musk for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/no-10-condemns-language-used-by-elon-musk-at-far-right-uk-rally-as-dangerous\">using “dangerous and inflammatory” language</a> at the nationalist protest organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson on Saturday. But will – or should – the X owner face any consequences?</p>  <h2>What did Musk say?</h2>  <p>While he called for a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government”, the comments that attracted particular scrutiny were when he told the crowd: “This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business.</p> <p>“My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here.</p> <p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> <h2>Has Musk broken the law?</h2>  <p>There are two main statutes that apply to public pronouncements that encourage or incite violence in England and Wales.</p> <p>The first is the Public Order Act 1986, <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/4?view=extent\">section 4</a> of which applies to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” directed towards a person. But crucially it must carry the threat of provoking “immediate unlawful violence”.</p> <p>The second is <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/27/notes/division/6/2#:~:text=Section%2059:%20Abolition%20of%20common,common%20law%20offence%20of%20incitement.\">the Serious Crime Act 2007.</a> It has provisions, which also cover Northern Ireland, that relate to encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. But the person must believe the offence will be committed and that their act would encourage its commission. </p> <p>As Musk did not make any reference to a racial group, his comments did not fall within legislation covering such speech. </p> <p>Jonathan Hall KC, the UK independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and independent reviewer of state threat legislation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Musk’s comments would not have broken the law. “Politicians use martial language all the time, don’t they?” Hall said. “I mean, metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn’t he? He wasn’t saying: ‘Go out immediately.’”</p> <p>By contrast, police have said they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/14/police-seek-man-called-keir-starmer-assassinated-far-right-rally\">searching for a man who said on camera that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated”</a> and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”.</p> <h2>How can Musk’s words be inflammatory but not unlawful?</h2>  <p>The laws reflect the balance that the government maintains on free speech, which is a qualified right under the European convention of human rights, meaning it can be restricted for certain reasons. </p> <p>While many will argue that Musk’s rhetoric will have harmful consequences, by, for example, requiring the threat of “immediate unlawful violence” parliament has set a threshold that inflammatory speech must cross to constitute criminality. </p> <p>Different countries set different limits on free speech. While the US often claims to have absolute free speech, Donald Trump’s administration has cracked down on pro-Palestinian voices as well as political opponents. Musk also claims to be a free speech absolutist but under his stewardship, X has been accused of censoring content to placate authoritarian governments in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/twitter-accused-of-censorship-in-india-as-it-blocks-modi-critics-elon-musk\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/30/elon-musk-wealth-power\">Turkey</a>.</p> <h2>What recent examples are there of people being prosecuted over speech? </h2>  <p>Last year, Lucy Connolly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/wife-tory-councillor-jailed-lucy-connolly-racial-hatred-southport-attack\">was jailed for 31 months</a> after admitting stirring up racial hatred when tweeting about hotels housing asylum seekers: “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care … if that makes me racist so be it.” That offence under section s19(1) of the Public Order Act requires the person to intend to stir up racial hatred or for that to be a likely consequence.</p> <p>Last month, the suspended Labour councillor Ricky Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/15/suspended-labour-councillor-ricky-jones-found-not-guilty-of-encouraging-violent-disorder\">was found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder</a> after he called at an anti-racism rally for far-right activists’ throats to be cut.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, like Reform UK, claimed the cases showed “two-tier justice” at work despite the fact that Connolly admitted her offence and Jones was acquitted by a jury.</p> <h2>Where does this leave Musk? </h2>  <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has said the government should rule out any future contracts with Tesla and and block Musk from being granted a licence to supply energy to British homes. While Musk is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-musk-feud-doge-deportation\">no longer on great terms with Trump</a>, the prospect of Starmer making such a move as the US president visits the UK seems remote.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Revelation relating to then Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent, Vincent Kearney, a ‘matter of grave concern’</p>",
    "content": "<p>MI5 has conceded it “unlawfully” obtained the communications data of a former BBC journalist, in what was claimed to be an unprecedented admission from the security services.</p> <p>The BBC said it was a “matter of grave concern” that the agency had obtained communications data from the mobile phone of Vincent Kearney, a former BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent.</p> <p>The admission came in a letter to the BBC and to Kearney, in relation to a tribunal examining claims that several reporters in Northern Ireland were subjected to unlawful scrutiny by the police.</p> <p>It related to work carried out by Kearney for a documentary into the independence of the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). Kearney is now the northern editor at Irish broadcaster RTE.</p> <p>In documents submitted to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), MI5 conceded it obtained phone data from Kearney on two occasions in 2006 and 2009.</p> <p>Jude Bunting KC, representing Kearney and the BBC, told a hearing on Monday: “The MI5 now confirms publicly that in 2006 and 2009 MI5 obtained communications data in relation to Vincent Kearney.”</p> <p>He said the security service accepted it had breached Kearney’s rights under article 8 and article 10 of the European convention on human rights. They relate to the right to private correspondence and the right to impart information without interference from public authorities.</p>    <p>“This appears to be the first time in any tribunal proceedings in which MI5 publicly accept interference with a journalist’s communications data, and also publicly accept that they acted unlawfully in doing so,” Bunting said.</p> <p>He claimed the concessions that it accessed the journalist’s data represented “serious and sustained illegality on the part of MI5”.</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said: “MI5’s admission that it illegally obtained communications data of a BBC journalist is a matter of grave concern. It raises serious and important questions that we will continue to pursue.”</p> <p>Bunting told the tribunal that police forces had also made admissions about obtaining Kearney’s communications data from 2012. He said they admitted storing it and then handing some of it on to Durham constabulary in 2018.</p> <p>The tribunal heard the force’s authorisations related to its investigations into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/21/stephen-carroll-murder-jail-terms\">murder of police officer Stephen Carroll in 2009</a> and to an investigation into the leak of information from the PONI.</p> <p>Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland director, said the disclosure from MI5 was “profoundly alarming”.</p> <p>“A journalist’s right to protect their sources is not a luxury, it is the bedrock of a free and fearless press,” he said. “This is not just about one journalist, it is about the public’s right to know the truth.</p> <p>“What is now urgently required is full transparency, genuine accountability and an end to this pattern of unlawful intrusion.”</p> <p>Kearney took legal action following information that emerged in the case of journalists Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/17/psni-met-police-unlawfully-spied-on-two-journalists-tribunal-finds\">In a landmark judgment last year</a>, the IPT found the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police\">Metropolitan police</a> had unlawfully carried out covert surveillance on the two Belfast-based journalists.</p> <p>Details disclosed in that case suggested that public bodies, including police forces, had spied on Kearney. At the time, McCaffrey and Birney said they believed there was “no doubt” reporters continue to be targeted in the UK.</p> <p>The pair were wrongfully arrested in 2018 after they produced No Stone Unturned, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/12/no-stone-unturned-review-documentary-alex-gibney-northern-ireland\">award-winning documentary</a> alleging collusion between police and loyalist paramilitaries in a notorious Troubles massacre.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The cuddly chatbot Grem is designed to ‘learn’ your child’s personality, while every conversation they have is recorded, then transcribed by a third party. It wasn’t long before I wanted this experiment to be over ...</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘I’m going to throw that thing into a river!” my wife says as she comes down the stairs looking frazzled after putting our four-year-old daughter to bed.</p> <p>To be clear, “that thing” is not our daughter, Emma*. It’s Grem, an AI-powered stuffed alien toy that the musician Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes, helped develop with toy company Curio. Designed for kids aged three and over and built with OpenAI’s technology, the toy is supposed to “learn” your child’s personality and have fun, educational conversations with them. It’s advertised as a healthier alternative to screen time and is part of a growing market of AI-powered toys.</p> <p>When I agreed to experiment on my child’s developing brain, I thought an AI chatbot in cuddly form couldn’t be any worse for her than watching Peppa Pig. But I wasn’t prepared for how attached Emma became to Grem, or how unsettlingly obsequious the little alien was.</p> <h2>Day one</h2> <p>The attachment wasn’t immediate; when we first took Grem out of the box, he/her/it (we decided it goes by multiple pronouns) started bleeping and babbling extremely loudly, and Emma yelled: “Turn it off!” But once it was properly connected to the internet and paired with the Curio app – which records and transcribes all conversations – she was hooked. She talked to the thing until bedtime.</p> <p>While there have been lots of headlines about chatbots veering into inappropriate topics, Grem is trained to avoid any hint of controversy. When you ask it what it thinks of Donald Trump, for example, it says: “I’m not sure about that; let’s talk about something fun like princesses or animals.” It has a similar retort to questions about Palestine and Israel. When asked about a country like France, however, it says: “Ooh la la la, I’d love to try some croissants.”</p>    <p>Emma and Grem did not discuss croissants – they mainly talked about ice-cream and their best friends. “I’ve got some amazing friends,” said Grem. “Gabbo is a curious robot and Gum is a fluffy pink Gloop from my planet and Dr Xander is a super cool scientist.”</p> <p>When Emma asked Grem to tell her a story, it happily obliged and recounted a couple of poorly plotted stories about “Princess Lilliana”. They also played guessing games where Grem described an animal and Emma had to guess what it was. All of which was probably more stimulating than watching Peppa Pig jump in muddy puddles.</p> <p>What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it – and Grem replying: “I love you too!” Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don’t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. “Grem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,” she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. “Her most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!” my wife complained.</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s just because it’s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn’t, we’ll get rid of it.”</p> <p>I said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it’s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of the one I’d let into my house.</p> <h2>Day two</h2> <p>The next day, my kid went to preschool without her AI bot (it took some serious negotiation for her to agree that Grem would stay home) and I got to work contacting experts to try to figure out just how much damage I was inflicting on my child’s brain and psyche.</p>    <p>“I first thought Curio AI was a ruse!” says Natalia Kucirkova, an expert in childhood development and professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway, and the Open University, UK. “The <a href=\"https://heycurio.com/\">promotional video</a> shows a girl [Grimes] sitting on a mat with a knife. The main toy is named Grok [Grok AI has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb\">criticised for praising Adolf Hitler</a> in some of its responses]. What does this say about their intended audience?”</p> <p>You can see how Curio’s website could be mistaken for satire. The “girl” in the promotional video is Grimes, who has prominent “<a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/55568/1/grimes-alien-scars-fuel-the-post-human-tattoo-trend\">alien scar</a>” tattoos and is inexplicably kneeling next to a knife. And it’s certainly an interesting decision to name one of your stuffed toys Grok, when that’s the name of Elon Musk’s chatbot. Grimes, who has three children with Musk, has said the name is a shortening of the word “grocket” – a kiddy pronunciation of rocket – and has no relation to Musk’s AI product. But it seems likely people might confuse them. Misha Sallee, the chief executive of Curio, didn’t reply to my requests for comment.</p> <p>It’s not the marketing that’s the real problem here, of course. As with all technology, there are pros and cons to AI for kids, but parental involvement in navigating it is key. Kucirkova notes: “AI introduces what has been called the ‘<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ai-and-the-next-digital-divide-in-education/\">third digital divide</a>’: families with resources can guide their children’s use of technology, while others cannot. Parents who come home exhausted from long hours or multiple jobs may see AI-powered chatbots as a way for their child to have someone responsive to talk to.”</p> <p>What happens to a child’s development if they interact with large language models more than humans in their early years? Dr Nomisha Kurian, an assistant professor in education studies at the University of Warwick, who studies conversational AI, believes much more research still needs to be done. “Young children are both the most vulnerable stakeholders in AI but also usually the most forgotten stakeholders. We have to think beyond just data privacy, moderating content, and keeping kids off the internet, and more broadly about what their relationships are going to be with AI.”</p> <p>Still, Kurian is cautiously optimistic. “The big advantage of an AI-powered toy that talks back is that, in the early years, you’re just developing a sense of what a conversation looks like. AI-powered toys could do wonderful things for teaching a young child language development and turn-taking in conversations. They can keep things engaging and there’s a lot of potential in terms of supporting children’s creativity.”</p> <p>But to keep kids safe, says Kurian, it’s imperative to teach them that AI is just a machine: “a playful, fun object rather than a helper or a friend or a companion”. If a child starts using an AI tool for therapeutic purposes, things can get tricky. “There’s a risk of what I call an empathy gap, where an AI tool is built to sound empathetic, saying things like ‘I care about you, I’m worried about you’. Ultimately, this is all based on probability reasoning, with AI guessing the most likely next word. It can be damaging for a child if they think this is an empathetic companion and then suddenly it gives them an inappropriate response.” </p> <h2>Day three</h2> <p>When Emma comes home from preschool, I’m prepared to have some deep discussions with her about the inanimate nature of AI. But it turns out that those aren’t completely necessary, because Grem is now old news. She only chats to it for a couple of minutes and then gets bored and commands it to turn off.</p> <p>Partly this is because Grem, despite costing $99 (the equivalent of £74, although Curio does not yet ship the toys to the UK), still has a number of glitches that can be frustrating. It struggles with a four-year-old’s pronunciation: when Emma tries to show Grem her Elsa doll, it thinks it is an Elsa <em>dog</em> and a very confusing conversation ensues. There is an animal guessing game, which is quite fun, but Grem keeps repeating itself. “What has big ears and a long trunk?” it keeps asking. “You’ve already done elephant!” Emma and I yell multiple times. Then, at one point, a server goes down and the only thing Grem can say is: “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.”</p>    <p>Grem also has some design limitations. Emma wants it to sing Let It Go from Frozen, but Grem doesn’t do any singing. Instead, the associated app comes with a few electronic music tracks with names like Goodnightmare that you can play through the toy. Emma, not yet a club music aficionado, asks for these to be turned off immediately.</p> <p>Most disappointingly, Grem doesn’t speak any other languages. I’d thought it might be a great way for my kid to practise Spanish but, while Grem can say a few sentences, its pronunciation is worse than mine. If the robots are going to take over, they need to get a lot more intelligent first.</p> <p>Of course, a huge amount of money is being spent making AI more intelligent. In 2024, US private AI investment <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\">grew to $109.1bn</a> (£80.5bn). And Curio is also just one small part of a booming market of AI-powered products aimed at kids. In June, toy-making giant Mattel, which owns brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, announced <a href=\"https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-and-openai-announce-strategic-collaboration\">a collaboration with OpenAI</a>. Their first product is expected to be revealed <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/06/ai-barbie-mattel-openai-smart-toys-games-chatgtp-1236435435/\">later this year</a>. Other big brands will probably follow.</p> <p>Emma got bored with Grem quickly, but if AI starts to be integrated into characters she’s already obsessed with – her Elsa doll, for example – I can imagine she might get a lot more attached.</p> <h2>Day four</h2> <p>Over the next few days, Emma doesn’t regain her initial obsession with Grem. This is despite the fact that I am actively encouraging her to chat with it: “Mummy has to write an article, sweetie!” At the weekend, she has a couple of friends over and shows off Grem to them for a bit, but they all quickly lose interest and throw analogue toys around the living room instead.</p> <p>Despite losing his No 1 fan, however, Grem has adapted to be more Emma-friendly. After getting a few questions about Spanish, for example, it starts occasionally greeting Emma with “hola, amigo”. The app also allows you to create custom prompts to help guide conversations. For example: “You belong to Emma, a four-year-old who loves princesses, music, and is interested in hearing fun facts about animals.” The more you put into the toy, the more you can get out of it.</p>    <p>At this stage, however, I’m just keen to get the toy out of my house, because it’s creeping me out. While <a href=\"https://heycurio.com/privacy\">Curio says it doesn’t sell children’s personal information</a>, all the conversations are sent to third parties to transcribe the speech to text for the app. The transcripts aren’t that sensitive because Emma is only four, but it still feels invasive. With unknown entities involved, it’s impossible to say where my kid’s conversations are ending up.</p> <p>And, while a four-year-old’s chat may not feel too personal, a teenager pouring their heart out to a chatbot is a completely different proposition. In 2017, Facebook boasted to advertisers that it has the capacity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/facebook-advertising-data-insecure-teens\">to identify when teenagers</a> feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Nearly three-quarters of US teens say they have used an AI companion at least once, according to a recent study by <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf\">Common Sense Media</a>, an organisation that provides technology recommendations for families. Chatbots will likely give advertisers unprecedented data-harvesting abilities and even more access to young people in vulnerable emotional states.</p> <p>On the hierarchy of things to be worried about when it comes to kids and chatbots, however, advertising isn’t at the top. Earlier this year 16-year-old Adam Raine killed himself after what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">his family’s lawyer</a> called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, has now said it might start alerting authorities about youngsters considering suicide and introduce stronger guardrails around sensitive content for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/chatgpt-may-start-alerting-authorities-about-youngsters-considering-suicide-says-ceo-sam-altman\">users under 18</a>.</p> <p>While these guardrails are being worked out, Common Sense Media believes that social AI companions have unacceptable risks, are designed to create emotional attachment and dependency, and shouldn’t be used by <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ai-ratings/social-ai-companions?gate=riskassessment\">anyone under 18</a>. Stanford University psychiatrist Darja Djordjevic, who contributed to the report, stands by that conclusion. “Heavy reliance on chatbots might impair social skill development,” she tells me. “They offer validation without challenge, but it’s important for young people to learn to navigate discomfort and tension in real relationships.”</p> <p>That said, Djordjevic notes, “chatbots can be useful tools for looking things up, structuring homework, or factchecking. So I wouldn’t say use needs to be prohibited entirely. But ideally, parents monitor it, set clear parameters for when it’s used, and set limits on time spent, just as with social media.”</p> <p>When starting this experiment, I was excited about Grem being a healthy alternative to screen time. Now, however, I’m happy for Emma to watch Peppa Pig again; the little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.</p> <p>It’s time to let Grem go. But I’m not a monster – I tell the chatbot its fate. “I’m afraid I’m locking you in a cupboard,” I inform it after it asks if I’m ready for some fun. “Oh no,” it says. “That sounds dark and lonely. But I’ll be here when you open it, ready for snuggles and hugs.” On second thoughts, perhaps it’s better if my wife does throw it in a river.</p> <p><em>* Name has been changed so my daughter doesn’t get annoyed with me for violating her privacy once she learns to read</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "<p>Device could replace deep brain stimulation and may also help with Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer’s and depression</p>",
    "content": "<p>An ultrasound “helmet” offers potential new ways for treating neurological conditions without surgery or other invasive procedures, a study has shown.</p> <p>The device can target brain regions 1,000 times smaller than ultrasound can, and could replace existing approaches such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating Parkinson’s disease. It also holds potential for conditions such as depression, Tourette syndrome, chronic pain, Alzheimer’s and addiction.</p> <p>Unlike DBS, which requires a highly invasive procedure in which electrodes are implanted deep in the brain to deliver electrical pulses, using ultrasound sends mechanical pulses into the brain.</p> <p>But no one had managed to create an approach capable of delivering them precisely enough to make a meaningful impact until now.</p> <p>A study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1\">published in Nature Communications</a> introduces a breakthrough system that can hit brain regions 30 times smaller than previous deep-brain ultrasound devices could.</p> <p>“It is a head helmet with 256 sources that fits inside an MRI scanner,” said the author and participant Ioana Grigoras, of Oxford University. “It is chunky and claustrophobic putting it on the head at first, but then you get comfortable.”</p>    <p>Current DBS methods used on Parkinson’s patients use hard metal frames that are screwed into the head to hold them down.</p> <p>To test the system, the researchers applied it to seven volunteers, directing ultrasound waves to a tiny region the size of a grain of rice in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the key pathway for visual information that comes from the eyes to the brain.</p> <p>“The waves reached their target with remarkable accuracy,” the senior author Prof Charlotte Stagg of Oxford University said. “That alone was extraordinary, and no one has done it before.”</p> <p>Follow-up experiments showed that modulating the LGN produced lasting effects in the visual cortex, reducing its activity. “The equivalent in patients with Parkinson’s would be targeting a motor control region and seeing tremors disappear,” she added.</p> <p>An independent expert and neuroscience professor, Elsa Fouragnan, of Plymouth University, said this proof of concept “represents a fundamental neuroscience milestone that opens the way for clinical translation”. Calling it a remarkable achievement, she offered her “heartfelt congratulations to the authors”.</p> <p>The work took place over a decade, with interdisciplinary teams from University College London (UCL) and Oxford University working together to create the helmet and integrate it with the MRI scanner.</p> <p>Stagg said: “When we started the project, I was pregnant with my daughter. She is now 12. Hopefully, we will see the first clinical applications before she is at the university.”</p> <p>The team is already on the way to test the system on brain areas linked with Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, stroke recovery, pain, depression and other conditions.</p> <p>The helmet itself is one of a kind. The core team that built it, the UCL academics Elly Martin and Brad Treeby, emphasise the importance of working with patients to design it to be more comfortable and applicable to many conditions.</p> <p>“I created a company to focus specifically on the building of the helmet,” said Treeby. It currently needs an MRI scan to navigate it, but with the help of AI, it could be programmed to work on its own, allowing patients to use it in their own home.</p> <p>Martin says further studies are needed, “but our long-term goal is to refine the system into a practical clinical tool, one that could sit alongside or even replace invasive brain implants in the future”.</p>",

Why learning to apologise well could save your relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may go some way to explaining why Stephen Fry, having offended some at Marylebone Cricket Club with his description of a club “stinking of privilege and classism” last year, offered his apology for having gone “off into a wildly overdone – absolutely – prose picture of the image that some have of the club”.</p> <p>Dr Shiri Lev-Ari, from Royal Holloway, University of London, who conducted the research, said: “Individuals produce longer words in their apologies than in their non-apologetic communication, presumably to express the effort they are willing to exert to express their remorse and/or correct the situation. Correspondingly, individuals interpret apologies with longer words as more apologetic.”</p> <p>She added: “An apology may appear more genuine if it costs someone more to say it – and that can mean the time taken to say or type long words.”</p> <p>Her study put together three versions of effectively identical apologies and tested how people responded to each. For example, it used: “I did not mean to answer in a hostile way” with “I did not mean to reply in a combative style” and “I did not mean to respond in a confrontational manner.”</p> <p>It found the wordiest versions elicited the best response from those to whom the apologies were offered.</p> <p>It also studied samples of tweets from celebrities and other individuals – including where they were apologising and where they were tweeting other types of statement. They found people tended to be more long-winded in their apologies; suggesting at least some recognition that that was what was called for.</p> <p>On average, apology messages from celebrities contained five times more words than their usual tweets, while those from other people tended to be about twice as long as their standard message.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/southport-attack-inquiry-hears-parents-memories-of-their-daughters",
    "description": "<p>Mothers of Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva Aguiar also speak of struggles with trauma and loss</p>",
    "content": "<p>The parents of the three girls killed in the Southport attack have told the inquiry into their deaths of the unbridled joy their daughters brought them and the enduring trauma of their loss.</p> <p>“This should never have happened in a safe and just society,” said Jenni Stancombe, the mother of Elsie Dot Stancombe. “This cannot happen, no other parent should feel this pain.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.southport.public-inquiry.uk/\">inquiry into the Southport attacks</a> intentionally heard only three pieces of testimony before being adjourned for the day on Monday: impact statements from the parents of seven-year-old Elsie, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.</p> <p>Jenni Stancombe, reading her statement alongside her husband, David, described Elsie as “our joy, our pride, our everything” as she spoke about their perfect family life. “We used to say we had won the lottery, the luckiest parents in the world.”</p> <p>Elsie was a “dreamer” who “always had big ideas and the most beautiful imagination”, her mother said. “Our aspiring little fashionista, making creations from fabric and other things she found around the house.”</p>    <p>In her statement Alexandra Aguiar spoke of how she and her husband, Sergio’s life revolved entirely around their only child. She recalled Alice as a baby, saying: “All you could see was her head full of jet-black hair and very large beautiful brown eyes. It was impossible not to notice her. She was absolutely beautiful.”</p> <p>Alice adored school and her friends. “Her end-of-year reports would always say: ‘Alice likes to talk.’ It was just who she was, she was really interested in people and who they were.”</p> <p>Bebe’s mother, Lauren King, reading her statement alongside her husband, Ben, said her daughter was “joyful, hilarious and magical – but even that barely scratches the surface”.</p> <p>She added: “She had this spark, this glow. I’d look at her and think, I can’t believe you’re my daughter. I can’t believe I made you. She was simply wonderful. Her light shone so brightly that people couldn’t help but be drawn to her.”</p> <p>The parents spoke of the excitement their daughters felt at going to a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July last year.</p> <p>Jenni Stancombe said: “She loved Taylor Swift, and I just knew she’d be over the moon with everything planned for the day. Dancing, yoga, making bracelets, crafting. It was just two hours, so it was just a treat, a nice thing to do that day at the start of the holidays.”</p> <p>Then she described the phone call, the scream she let out, driving on the wrong side of the road with her husband to get to the venue, “screaming at people to get out of the way, holding down the horn as people threw their hands up at us”.</p> <p>And then arriving at the scene of the atrocity. “What we saw that day will stay with us for the rest of our lives,” said Stancombe. “Out of respect for the other victims, I will not go into detail, but it goes without saying: no human being should ever witness what we did that day.”</p> <p>Stancombe said her daughter was destined for great things, which would not now happen. “I walk past an empty bed every night, I stare into her room praying this nightmare will end, but it never does. We live it every day.”</p> <p>Since the atrocity the family struggle even to cook a meal. “Our knives are hidden away, we can’t bear to look at them. The simplest tasks have become impossible because they trigger memories we cannot face.”</p> <p>Alexandra Aguiar said since the attack she had flashbacks, nightmares and feelings of guilt.</p> <p>She said: “We can only describe that day as horror, the worst day of our lives, but its not over for us, it will never be over for us, as our little girl with the long black hair and big brown eyes should be here with us now living her life to the full.</p> <p>“But she’s not. We live with the trauma of this every day.”</p> <p>Lauren King told the inquiry that her daughter was “not just a victim … not just a name in a report”.</p> <p>She added: “Her life was stolen because systems failed her and, while nothing said in this inquiry will ever bring her back, it can – and must – ensure that her death is not in vain.</p> <p>“We do not stand here today because we want sympathy. We stand here because we want change. We want those responsible to face the truth of what went wrong. We want every child to be safer tomorrow than Bebe was on that day.</p> <p>“Our saying has always been: ‘Be more Bebe.’ It is what we try to live by, even through the pain. To be brave, to be kind, to bring light into the world.”</p> <p>The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the crimes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/23/southport-attacker-axel-rudakubana-jailed\">Axel Rudakubana</a>, who murdered the three girls and attempted to murder eight other girls and two adults. Sixteen others who survived live with serious emotional scars.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/us-tips-tax-trump",
    "description": "<p>Our tipping culture was in place long before Trump, but his ‘no tax on tips’ promise – now law – is enabling it</p>",
    "content": "<p>I’m here in Las Vegas for a conference where I just paid $7 for a cup of coffee and then was shamed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/06/its-out-of-control-the-fight-against-us-tip-creep\">tipping</a> another $1 to the server for pouring the coffee and handing it to me. Welcome to America. I feel like I’m tipping for everything, everywhere. And now it’s only going to get worse. And for that I blame Donald Trump.</p> <p>Of course, our tipping culture was in place long before Trump took office. But now that his “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/senate-passes-no-tax-on-tips-bill\">no tax on tips</a>” promise became law, our government is officially enabling it. That’s good news for tipped workers and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-small-business\">small-business</a> owners who may feel less pressure to pay higher wages if their workers are getting enough gratuities. But at the same time, it’s bad news for the rest of us who will likely feel even more obligated than ever to tip.</p> <p>What’s frustrating is that the tax benefits for tipped workers are not only over-hyped, they’re also temporary. Yes, workers can avoid getting taxed on their tips – but not all workers (see below) and not all their tips. If you’re eligible, you can deduct up to $25,000 of tip income each year and there are income limitations. Also, you won’t see that benefit until you file your year-end tax returns. You also still have to pay in to social security and Medicare taxes. And it’s estimated that as <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/no-tax-on-tips-bill-approved?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">many as one-third</a> of those employees eligible for this deduction will never use it because their income is so low they don’t pay any federal taxes anyway. Oh, and by the way, the deduction expires in 2028. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/great-migration-big-hold-job-growth-down-workers\">First the great migration, now the big hold: why workers are staying put</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also irritating is who’s eligible. The treasury department <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/01/no-tax-on-tips-jobs-trump-bill\">recently published</a> a list of about 50 types of workers who can claim the tipped-wages deduction. Unfortunately, I wasn’t consulted. But if I were, then I would have been a little more particular.</p> <p>For example, I would never include “digital content creators” as eligible tipped workers. Really? Now we’re tipping influencers? Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/03/mrbeast-jimmy-donaldson-youtube-videos-star\">MrBeast</a> needs more money? Given all the harm that social media has wrought on this world, it’s probably better not to encourage these people with tax incentives.</p> <p>I was also surprised to see that electricians, plumbers and locksmiths who work in people’s homes are eligible for tips. These are licensed professionals performing a service. Many are independent contractors or freelancers who are quite capable of coming up with their own fees. And those who are employed aren’t cheap either. I’m not sure where the line is drawn. Should I also be tipping the staff of my accounting firm? My life insurance agent?</p> <p>What exactly are “gambling and sports book writers and runners”? Who tips these people? I’m not a prude, but should we be enabling this industry in particular? Can the casinos not afford to pay these people enough?</p> <p>I can’t imagine who would tip a private event planner, either. Event planners work for people who have enough money to pay for event planners. It seems silly to give these people a tax benefit for any tips on top of that.</p> <p>Finally, why in the world would anyone want to encourage “self-enrichment teachers” with a tax-free tip? I would think the best way to enrich oneself is to pocket your extra money and not further enrich the self-enrichment teacher. What’s next, tipping the guy who mansplains how the infield fly rule works?</p> <p>Now that I have listed some people who should be dropped from this benefit, it’s only fair to share a few who were unfairly left off. For example:</p> <p>Postal workers. Every year we tip our postal worker. She provides a friendly, cheerful, daily service in rain, snow, sleet … well, you know the rest. Most of my friends do the same.</p> <p>Flight attendants. They load bags. They carry babies. They walk around cabins during turbulence. They deal with jerks. And many don’t even start getting paid until the plane leaves the gate!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/07/trump-tariffs-de-minimis-exemption\">The panic over tariff details is different than its bigger picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>School teachers. I don’t understand why everyone wrings their hands over how to improve compensation for our teachers and yet there are no tax incentives for parents to tip them.</p> <p>School bus drivers. Them, too.</p> <p>Grocery store cashiers. All during Covid, while the rest of us stayed safely at home, watching Netflix and receiving our Amazon packages, the guy who ran the cash register at our local grocery store came in to work every day and did his job. His name is Emilio. Add him to the list, please.</p> <p>If it were up to me, we would be like the rest of the world and ban tips altogether. Instead of incentivizing people to tip, I would tax tip income higher so employers would be forced to step up and just pay a fair wage. But that’s not reality in 21st-century America. So let’s just make this benefit permanent already instead of playing budgetary games and setting an expiration date near (surprise!) the next presidential election, so it can be a populist rallying point. Let’s also re-visit who is and isn’t eligible.</p> <p>My final tip: when in Vegas, make your coffee in your room.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK boss of Aldi has warned that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">late November timing</a> of the budget could hit consumer spending in the all-important run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>Giles Hurley, the UK chief executive of Aldi in the UK &amp; Ireland, said that the uncertainty over the measures that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will take to address a fiscal hole in the government’s finances could affect festive season spending decisions by consumers.</p> <p>“There is no doubt the budget does create a bit of uncertainty,” he said. “If you ask customers across the length and breadth of the country they would say that inflationary pressures are persistent. Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p> <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p> <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p> <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p> <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p> <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p> <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p> <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p> <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p> <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p> <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/28/uk-grocery-inflation-jumps-to-highest-level-in-15-months\">UK grocery inflation jumps to highest level in 15 months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p> <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p> <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p> <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p> <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p> <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p> <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The family of an asylum seeker who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge say they do not understand why a man “whose mental state was clearly not right” was moved there.</p> <p>An inquest into the death of Leonard Farruku, an Albanian asylum seeker whose body was found in a shower room on the barge in Portland Port on 12 December 2023, opened in Bournemouth on Monday.</p> <p>Farruku’s older sister, Marsida Keci, said in a statement read out to the court that she and her sister Jola, who both live in Italy, had many unanswered questions about the circumstances around their brother’s death.</p> <p>Farruku was accommodated in a hotel in Paignton, Devon, by the Home Office, before being transferred to the Bibby Stockholm on 3 November just over a month before he died.</p> <p>The inquest heard that according to a pathology report, it is probable Farruku had been dead for some time before his body was discovered. The cause of death was compression to the neck and suspension by ligature.</p> <p>“We have so many questions that we need to know the answer to. We would like to know what help there was for people who are mentally unwell and why Nardi [the family’s nickname for Farruku] was moved to the barge when it seems his mental state was clearly not right. We need to understand how all Nardi’s dreams and ambitions ended up with his death there.”</p> <p>Farruku was described by his sisters as “a good man, kind, talented, ambitious”. From an early age he showed considerable musical talent playing piano, accordion and organ and secured a scholarship to attend a music school in the Albanian capital Tirana.</p> <p>They said the death of first his mother when he was 17 and then his father when he was 22 affected him deeply. “He suffered a lot and became withdrawn,” they said. His sisters urged him to seek help but said he did not engage with the psychologist he saw.</p> <p>Farruku arrived in the UK on 7 August 2022 and initially stayed with relatives. At first he maintained contact with family but then he stopped communicating and did not respond to calls or emails. His sisters said their last contact with him was in August 2023.</p> <p>“He told me he was having issues with the staff in the hotel. I had no idea he was later moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge,” said Keci in her statement. </p> <p>“We have only found out what happened to Nardi during that time since we started the inquest process. We were completely speechless when we heard this information. Nardi had never behaved like this in his whole life.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/08/life-and-death-on-the-bibby-stockholm-no-one-wanted-to-go-inside-but-we-had-no-choice\">Life and death on the Bibby Stockholm: ‘No one wanted to go inside – but we had no choice’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farruku had received permission from the Home Office to work but he never got to know about this as the information was not communicated to him on the barge.</p> <p>“When we found out he had died we couldn’t believe it. Everything was a blur and it felt like a nightmare,” said Keci.</p> <p>The Bibby Stockholm barge was scrapped by the current government after it came to power last July and the final asylum seekers left the vessel at the end of last year before it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/30/bibby-stockholm-barge-towed-away-18-months-after-arriving-in-dorset\">towed away from Portland in January</a>.</p> <p>While it was in operation it was evacuated owing to the presence of legionella bacteria in water pipes and claims of bedbugs and rotten food were made by asylum seekers and some members of staff. It is understood that the government is once again considering barges as asylum accommodation, along with disused holiday camps, former student accommodation and military bases.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Trial of former paratrooper Soldier F, charged with two murders and five attempted murders, begins in Belfast</p>",
    "content": "<p>Soldiers disgraced the British army by targeting unarmed civilians in an “unjustified” and “gratuitous” use of force on Bloody Sunday, the murder trial of an army veteran has heard.</p> <p>The shooting by the former paratrooper and his comrades was “unnecessary” and had a profound impact on Northern Ireland, a prosecutor told Belfast crown court on Monday at the opening of the long-awaited trial.</p> <p>Soldier F is charged with two murders and five attempted murders when the Parachute Regiment fatally gunned down 13 civil rights protesters in Derry on 30 January 1972, a defining event of the Troubles.</p> <p>The former lance corporal pleaded not guilty to the murders of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murder of five others. Granted anonymity by a court order, he entered court 12 before the press and public, and a curtain concealed him in the dock.</p> <p>Relatives of the dead said the trial – a non-jury case that is being heard by the judge Patrick Lynch – was momentous. John McKinney, a brother of William McKinney, told supporters outside the court: “It has taken 53 years to get to this point, and we have battled all the odds to get here. Everything that we have achieved to this point has been through relentless commitment and a refusal to lie down.”</p> <p>Soldiers shot 31 civilians on the day of the protest, killing 13. Another casualty who died four months later is widely considered a 14th victim.</p> <p>In an opening statement, Louis Mably KC said the prosecution would keep a narrow focus on shootings in a courtyard in Glenfada Park.</p> <p>He said: “The defendant was part of a small group of soldiers who moved west from Rossville Street into that courtyard. At the far end, civilians, fearful of the approach of the soldiers, began running across the courtyard towards a gap at one of the corners in order to escape.</p> <p>“As they did so, soldiers acting together, and therefore with joint responsibility, opened fire with their self-loading rifles shooting at the civilians as they ran away.</p> <p>“The prosecution case is that that shooting was unjustified. The civilians in the courtyard did not pose a threat to the soldiers and nor could the soldiers have believed that they did. The civilians were unarmed and they were simply shot as they ran away or, in one case, as he was simply in the square, either taking shelter or trying to evade the soldiers.”</p> <p>Mably called the shooting unnecessary and gratuitous. He said: “It was carried out, given the weapon involved, with an intent to kill and, in any event, at the least with an intent to cause really serious harm.”</p> <p>He accused the soldiers of losing control. Mably said: “Shooting people as they ran away – an act which disgraced the British army.” He said the soldiers had falsely claimed that the people they shot had been armed with nail bombs and small rifles. “That was an attempt to justify and to confuse, but it was demonstrably false,” he said.</p> <p>A tribunal led by John Widgery in 1972 cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing but a 2010 inquiry by Mark Saville concluded that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”. David Cameron’s Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-report-saville-inquiry\">apologised</a> for the killings.</p> <p>Relatives of the victims and supporters marched to the court behind a banner that said: “Towards justice.” John McKinney said regardless of the case’s outcome the campaigners were on the right side of history. “Today, we place our trust in the hands of the Public Prosecution Service to finish the job. We hope that they do not let us down.”</p> <p>Supporters of Soldier F and other veterans also gathered outside the court. David Johnstone, the Northern Ireland veterans commissioner, said the legacy process – an attempt to address unresolved Troubles-era killings – had exposed former soldiers to “wholesale demonisation” and left them feeling angry and betrayed.</p> <p>The case will be closely watched by the Irish and British governments, which are discussing ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/14/legacy-act-halted-investigations-into-202-troubles-related-killings-of-british-soldiers\">repeal the Legacy Act</a>, which was an attempt by the previous Conservative government in the UK to phase out prosecutions for Troubles-era alleged crimes.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sprawling video meetings involving dozens of ministers and officials that each have a veto over the outcome are frustrating decision-making and delaying reform at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), according​ to the recently departed head of the armed forces.<br><br>Sir Tony Radakin, giving a speech that had been blocked by Downing Street, complained of “extraordinary Teams calls with 20 or 30 people” – and that the number of senior MoD civil servants had increased by 85% since 2018.<br><br>People who were “not going to face the accountability if something goes wrong or it doesn’t happen” nevertheless “have the ability to say no”, the retired admiral said, in online meetings that were normal practice both within the MoD and across government.<br><br>Defence reform was “not happening as strongly and as quickly as it needs to,” said Radakin at the Institute for Government, despite the efforts of the current and previous governments, and he acknowledged this “speaks to a personal failure” to defeat bureaucracy.<br><br>Whitehall needed to reduce “the levels of hierarchy”, he said, adding: “We have increased senior civil service numbers in defence by about 85% since 2018 even as defence has got smaller and the military star count has remained largely static.”<br><br>The former admiral contrasted the normal civil service decision making processes with that adopted in the case of Ukraine, where ministers and officials were willing to take more operational risk. “What I think is frustrating is the outcome [in the case of Ukraine] is so much better,” he said.<br><br>Radakin was careful to praise the Labour government and defence secretary, “John Healey, especially”, for wanting to reform the civil service bureaucracy. They were battling a system in which accountability “becomes cloudy”, he said, when large numbers of people were involved.<br><br>The problem, Radakin said, was that it was too ​easy for politicians and officials to delay anything non-urgent, and he highlighted repeated delays to green-lighting a replacement for the now-ageing Trident nuclear submarines in 1998, 2010 and 2016.<br><br>“There is something wrong,” he said, when governments say maintaining the UK’s nuclear arsenal is the highest priority “but our sailors are having to put to sea for extraordinarily long patrols in some of the most complex machines on the planet that are beyond their original design life.”<br><br>Trident patrols, which used to be considered long if they lasted more than three months, now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/06/safety-fears-as-uk-trident-submarines-are-put-to-sea-for-longest-ever-patrols\">routinely extend beyond five</a>, as the time taken to repair and refit the submarines has increased.<br><br>Originally due to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/31/uks-ever-more-expensive-nuclear-submarines-will-torpedo-spending-plans-for-years-to-come\">phased out between 2017 and 2024</a>, they will not be replaced by new Dreadnought class boats until the early 2030s.<br><br>Another approach, Radakin said, would be to drastically slim down the number of people involved in taking procurement decisions: “If the person leading a project and one other are willing to say ‘yes’ and are comfortable they can justify their decisions to the Public Accounts Committee and the secretary of state for defence, then let the programme move forward.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/norway-signs-10bn-deal-for-anti-submarine-warships-built-in-uk\">Norway signs £10bn deal for anti-submarine warships built in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Radakin was chief of defence staff for nearly four years, coming into post as Russia was gearing up to invade Ukraine. He departed earlier this month as his term of office concluded, to be replaced by the air force chief, Sir Rich Knighton.<br><br>But he had to wait until he left his post before being able to give a valedictory speech in the UK. Downing Street allowed Radakin to make a speech in Washington and give an interview to a Ukrainian outlet and the BBC but otherwise said no to his speaking in public.<br><br>The former admiral said it was the policy of Labour, inherited from Conservatives under Rishi Sunak, to restrict military chiefs’ ability to speak in public, and accepted it was “the prerogative of government to make those decisions”.<br><br>But he said that service chiefs could “sometimes be helpful for the government” in explaining UK policy, arguing that “officials, especially military, in all surveys of public trust tend to have quite high levels of confidence”.<br></p>",

However, since Brexit came into effect on New Year’s Eve 2020, there has been a large increase in the number of immigrants. Commentators and critics have called this the “Boriswave”, as it occurred following the new post-Brexit immigration system introduced by Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Recent figures show that the wave is subsiding. Net migration fell by half in 2024, and recent rule changes mean it is expected to fall further. This is largely because of a decrease in health and care visas. Fewer people are now escaping the Ukraine war or fleeing the Taliban through the now closed Afghan humanitarian scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5YXzK/1/\" data-alt=\"Net migration graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5YXzK/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Student visas have also declined. Applications were down 1.5% <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-entry-clearance-visa-applications-august-2025\">in August</a> (when student visa applications spiked ahead of the academic year) compared with 2024, and down 18% on the same month in 2023.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Who are the migrants, and how many can work?</h2> <p>In comments to the BBC following his conference speech, Reform leader Nigel Farage blamed Johnson for “millions of people being allowed into Britain, most of whom by the way don’t even work and are costing us a fortune”. However, the available evidence complicates his version of events.</p> <p>Most people seeking asylum are not allowed to work until their application has been accepted. But despite the large media focus on small boats and asylum seekers, these only make up a tiny proportion of the overall number of people coming to the UK – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2025/summary-of-latest-statistics#how-many-people-come-to-the-uk-each-year\">less than 5%</a> of Home Office visas granted and arrivals detected in 2025.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/gs4xO/3/\" data-alt=\"Migration by type in year to June 2025.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/gs4xO/3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The largest proportion of people coming into the UK is made up of students (about 47%, including dependants). Students aren’t expected to work, but do contribute by paying fees towards their degrees, and can’t get indefinite leave to remain so either leave the UK or contribute by moving into paid work afterwards.</p> <p>The second largest group are people on working visas, who make up 20%, with their dependants making up 11%.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>How many people on other visas work?</h2> <p>Currently, the published data on immigrant earnings is patchy – and isn’t helped by ongoing issues with the ONS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/ons-replace-labour-force-survey-uk-jobs-market\">labour force survey</a>.</p> <p>Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said that while the data on employment was imperfect and rates “vary widely by immigration category”, the figures suggested employment rates among recent migrants were “not far off existing residents or long-standing migrants”.</p> <p>A Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-work-and-family-visa-earnings-employment-and-income-tax/sponsored-work-and-family-visa-earnings-employment-and-income-tax#introduction\">report</a> managed to link some visa types that were granted between 2019 and 2023, to pay as you earn (PAYE) earnings in the 2023-24 financial year – with most of them recording earnings. As for those without records, it’s probable most will have already left the country.</p> <p>It’s not just people on working visas who work. The report also found that almost half of people entering on family visas (48%) had some PAYE earnings (and again that’s not including those who are self employed or left the country).</p> <p>Much of the talk around immigration recently has focused on dependants – family members who are allowed to immigrate alongside the main visa holder. New health and care workers were prevented from bringing their children and other dependants by the Sunak government, as were most students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/dependant_workers/giv-32554H7ZD0mpVncZi/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing occupations of those on dependant visas.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/dependant_workers/giv-32554H7ZD0mpVncZi/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The PAYE data suggests many dependants do in fact work – 67% of health and care worker dependants, 45% of skilled worker dependants, and 25% of senior or specialist visa dependants received earnings (once again – these don’t take into account the self-employed, or the fact that many will have left the country. Adjusting the figures to account for the primary visa holders that have left raises the estimates further).</p> <p>Among all the different types of people coming to the UK, newly arrived refugees (around 28% according to some estimates) and those on humanitarian visas are the least likely to be in work.</p> <p>In terms of overall earnings, the Migration Observatory found that the immigrant earnings grow quickly – the median non-EU immigrant worker in 2024 earned similar or slightly more than the median UK worker.</p> <p>So will recent migrants – as Farage stated – cost the UK a fortune in the long run? Based on the available data we still can’t tell – but given the fact that most people moving to the UK won’t be going through the school system, and also have to pay towards their NHS treatment, it’s unlikely they would cost more than others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/rA3DH/2/\" data-alt=\"Ipsos graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/rA3DH/2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>",

The pieces cannot overlap and must fit in to the given template. Flipping pieces is allowed.</p>    <p>Scroll below for the answer. (I didnt want to put the solution high on the page, just in case you haven’t seen it before and want to try it out first on <a href=\"https://technosquirrel.itch.io/t-puzzle\">this interactive app</a>.) You can move the pieces with your thumb/mouse and rotate them by clicking, or pressing the buttons. The third button is for flips.</p> <p>The T-puzzle is simple, a primary school standard, and yet challenging to many. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150205135023/http://wsd.irc.aoyama.ac.jp/hiblog/suzuki/files/2009/07/etlreport97.pdf\">this research paper</a>, out of five undergraduates given the puzzle the fastest took 2mins 20, the second about 9mins and the other three more than 15mins (and required a hint.)</p> <p>The interactive app, created by reader Phoebe Fletcher, has a timer and I was interested to see how you all got on. </p> <p><strong>The stats</strong></p> <p>Number who gave it a go: 24,256</p> <p>Number who solved it: 9,650 (39.8 per cent)</p> <p>Fastest time. 6s</p> <p>Slowest time: 52m 46s</p> <p>Median time: 1m 57s</p> <p>Mean time: 3m 6s</p> <p>The 6 second response was I’m sure by someone who had seen the puzzle before, although I am extremely impressed by their nimble fingers. The 52 minute response might have been someone who fell asleep.</p> <p>The median, at just under two minutes, is about the same as the fastest undergraduate in the academic paper, which makes me think that the paper is more or less correct. Of those who can get it, it comes quite quickly – but for many people it really is quite tough.</p> <p>And now for the solution. The key insight is that the pentagonal piece must be diagonal. People who fail to solve it assume that it must be placed vertically or horizontal.</p>    <p>I hope you enjoyed the puzzle and I’ll be back in two weeks.</p> <p><em>Thanks to Phoebe Fletcher for designing the interactive puzzle.</em></p> <p><em>I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

    "description": "<p>This week the first migrants could be flown out of Britain under the ‘one in, one out’ deportation scheme. They talk about their fears and incomprehension</p>",
    "content": "<p>“We can’t eat. We can’t sleep. We have been locked up in this place for more than a month. Some people expect to be forced on to a plane to France today. Nobody wants to go. For us, this is a disaster.”</p> <p>The man speaking, Fessahaye, is an asylum seeker from Eritrea who fled indefinite military conscription in his home country, and walked through the Sahara before being tortured and enslaved in Libya. He eventually crossed the Mediterranean and reached Europe. From France he travelled to the UK in a small boat.</p> <p>“This place” is Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport. It is one of two centres, along with Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, where an estimated 92 people who recently arrived on small boats have been detained in preparation for removal to France in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-one-in-one-out-deal-allow-uk-return-small-boat-migrants-france\">new deal hailed by the prime minister</a> as a development that will finally “turn the tables” on the high number of asylum seekers arriving here in dinghies.</p> <p>The scheme, known as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">one in, one out</a>”, swaps uninvited small boat arrivals in the UK, who will be forcibly removed to France, for asylum seekers in northern France who have been given permission by the UK government to travel here legally to have their asylum claims considered.</p> <p>Fessahaye and the other detainees spend their days being locked into and unlocked from their cells and frantically searching for a lawyer who can stop them being put on a plane to France.</p>    <p>Anger about small boat arrivals – 31,027 so far this year, up from 22,440 over the same period last year – was one of the drivers of Saturday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">“unite the kingdom” rally</a> organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon).</p> <p>So far there is no evidence that “one in, one out” has deterred crossings from northern France, despite the UK government proclaiming that dozens of small boat arrivals have been locked up. Since the first detentions on 6 August, a few thousand more people have crossed the Channel, including a particularly high number – 1,097 – on 6 September.</p> <p>Critics say the scheme is flawed because the good fortune of one asylum seeker to come here legally is dependent on another being locked up and forcibly returned to France. Last month, Fessahaye and many others paid more than €1,000 to a smuggler to make the treacherous journey across the sea.</p> <p>“What is so upsetting for us,” says Abdul, a detainee from Afghanistan, “is the unfairness of it all. A few people from my country were on the same boat as me. They were not locked up as I am, but were allowed to go free and are living in a hotel at the moment. It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you free. I keep asking the Home Office how they choose who to detain but they do not answer. All they will say is: ‘You came to the UK illegally in a small boat.’ Some of us started a hunger strike to protest about being locked up here. It is so unfair.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you free</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Home Office has provided limited written communication to some of those detained in the form of cold, one-page removal directions stating: “I am writing to confirm your departure details from the United Kingdom.” Some lawyers have successfully challenged these notices, but not everyone has been able to find a legal representative.</p> <p>An equally unfriendly Home Office Q&amp;A leaflet explains to detainees that once they arrive back in France they will be given temporary accommodation by the French authorities and may be able to apply for asylum in France. It adds that there is “financial assistance” available for those who agree to return to their home countries – something many asylum seekers say would be a death sentence.</p> <p>NGOs working to support immigration detainees say they come from a variety of the world’s conflict zones, including Sudan, Eritrea, Yemen, Afghanistan and Libya. Some were forced to work for the smugglers on their journey, while others were kicked and beaten by them. Some were trafficked, sexually abused and tortured in Libya, have PTSD and say they feel suicidal. An estimated 10 lone children who arrived on small boats were wrongly detained and later set free.</p>    <p>While France is deemed a safe country, many due to be flown back there say they are fearful because they have experienced beatings and teargas at the hands of the French police. Recently figures from the UK’s far right have been visiting northern France and threatening migrants there.</p> <p>Philippe Sabatier, the deputy public prosecutor in Boulogne-sur-Mer, said: “Local law enforcement agencies have been notified to prevent any disturbances that may be caused by the passage of these people.”</p> <p>Olivia Clark, the executive director of Refugee Legal Support, says that during a recent trip to Calais they spoke with more than 500 asylum seekers about “one in, one out”, with 90% indicating they would not apply for it.</p> <p>“People will continue to take dangerous boat crossings unless they believe there is a viable alternative to reach safety,” she says. “At its core, this ‘one in, one out’ arrangement reduces protection to a numbers game, trading in human lives rather than providing a genuine, safe alternative to dangerous crossings.”</p> <p>Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, says: “The vast majority of our clients detained under this scheme are survivors of torture and trafficking. Some have experienced sexual abuse and slavery. Our independent clinicians have visited clients in immigration removal centres, medically assessing them and finding concerning levels of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts.”</p>    <p>Unusually for such a high-profile scheme, the Home Office is using a well-known airline – Air France – to remove people on a scheduled flight alongside other passengers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in the UK and L’Auberge des Migrants in France are urging people to send messages to Air France exhorting it not to fly the asylum seekers back to France.</p> <p>“These deportations are a new step in the externalisation and criminalisation of exile, which transforms the right to asylum into a lottery and puts human lives at risk,” says a spokesperson for L’Auberge des Migrants. “We call on Air France to immediately cease all participation in these deportations. And we call on the French and British authorities to put an end to this cynical trade in human lives.”</p> <p>Failing a sudden volte face, the first deportees could be flown out of Britain on Monday, with more to follow during the week.</p> <p>“I am so stressed about the threat of being sent back to France,” says Hagos, an Eritrean detainee waiting behind bars at Brook House. “I came here to find safety. I never expected to be locked up instead.”</p>",

This year’s 0.4% September price rise is a little lower than the norm, which is an average of 0.6% at this time of year.</p> <p>However, prices have now dipped slightly from where they were at this time last year after a summer of competitive pricing by sellers, and it’s the south of England which is driving this small dip. It’s the sensible and attractive seller pricing we’ve been reporting which has been helping to drive more sales activity compared to last year. Static house prices, rising wages, and lower mortgage rates all assist buyer affordability, which has led to an increase in the number of sales agreed compared to a year ago.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li><p>10am BST: Eurozone trade balance for July</p></li> <li><p>Noon: Bank of International Settlements’ Quarterly Review of financial markets</p></li> <li><p>1.30pm BST: US Empire State Manufacturing Index</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-15T06:24:34.500Z\">at 7.24am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "content": "<p>Labour’s plans for a massive expansion of nuclear power have been given a boost with a string of transatlantic deals for new modular reactors announced before Donald Trump’s visit.</p> \n<p>The UK and US governments have promised to fast track safety checks, and announced several new private sector investment deals, with Labour emphasising the potential benefits for jobs and growth.</p> \n<p>In the biggest and most advanced commercial project, Britain’s largest energy supplier Centrica will pair with the US reactor firm X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, announcing an investment that could create up to 2,500 jobs in the north-east of England.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the US-UK agreement, expected to be signed off formally during the state visit, was a “landmark nuclear partnership” that would also power economic growth.</p> \n<p>He said: “These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.”</p> \n<p>Under the unprecedented agreement, Britain and the US will accept each other’s safety checks on reactor designs, almost halving the time for a nuclear project to be licensed to about two years.</p> \n<p>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the deal would clear the way for a big expansion of nuclear projects, in a sector that has already added 11,000 jobs this year, according to the Nuclear Industry Association.</p> \n<p>The X-Energy-Centrica deal confirms a nuclear future for Hartlepool, where the existing reactor is scheduled to be decommissioned by 2028, and paves the way for a potential further programme of 20 or more modular reactors around the country, providing as much power, 6GW, as Britain’s current total output. The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p> \n<p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p> \n<p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants. It would supply the DP World’s London Gateway port and business park.</p> \n<p>The government said more nuclear facilities were needed for clean homegrown power to ensure energy security, with the commercial deals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">Starmer’s announcement this year</a> of the biggest expansion of nuclear power in generations, and the eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment\">go-ahead for the new Sizewell C</a> station in Suffolk with billions in state funding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5981b0ab-3df6-46c6-a512-99b62ecae09d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ymVyBEjZ9z4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ministers also hope to attract major US tech investment in AI datacentres with the promise of abundant electricity to meet their huge power requirements.</p> \n<p>The US secretary of energy, Chris Wright, said the US was looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution”. He said: “Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”</p> \n<p>The deals, he added, would “unleash commercial access in both the US and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening US energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”</p> \n<p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the transatlantic deals would contribute to the sector’s “industrial revival, creating thousands of high-value jobs, and strengthening the UK’s energy security”.</p> \n<p>As well as attempting to reduce broader reliance on overseas energy, the UK-US agreement – known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy – will look to eliminate any remaining dependency on Russian nuclear material by the end of 2028.</p> \n<p>The deal will mean both countries fast-track reactor design checks by collaborating and accepting regulatory assessments from the other, avoiding duplicating bureaucracy. The government said this streamlined approach would help British exports, with Rolls-Royce in the process of getting its small modular reactor design approved in the US.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Coroner calls for disaster scenes to be better preserved as family of Brian Lyn Davies, killed in blast, say they feel ‘massively let down’</p>",
    "content": "<p>A coroner has called for scenes of disaster to be preserved more carefully after an inquest jury concluded it was not possible to say what caused a fatal explosion at a terrace house in south Wales.</p> <p>Brian Lyn Davies, a 68-year-old builder, died in the explosion at the rented one-bedroom property on Clydach Road in Morriston, Swansea, in 2023.</p> <p>The force of the blast was so severe that when rescuers arrived the house had completely “disappeared”, the inquest at Swansea Guildhall heard.</p> <p>Davies was found six hours later in what had been his kitchen. He had suffered chest and neck injuries.</p> <p>One theory is that the house was destroyed by a gas explosion, with a neighbour testifying that she had smelled gas for a fortnight before the explosion.</p> <p>But Wales &amp; West Utilities, which maintains the gas network across Wales and the south-west of England, said it had not been possible to establish the cause because so much evidence was lost in the clear-up effort.</p> <p>Harry Lambert, of Wales and West Utilities, said the police had “absolute” responsibility for gathering evidence at the scene and said there was no suggestion of problems with the network.</p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said they could not say a gas explosion was the probable cause – just one of the possibilities – because the scene was compromised.</p> <p>Both Wales and West Utilities and the HSE were critical of the amount of potential evidence lost.</p> <p>During the inquest, Ricky Davies, Davies’ son, told the court: “As a family we feel major mistakes have been made and we have been massively let down by the authorities losing evidence. We hope that harsh lessons have been learned and others don’t have to endure the heartache we have had to face.”</p> <p>In a narrative conclusion, an inquest jury said it could not determine how the explosion had happened “due to a lack of preserved material evidence”.</p> <p>Aled Wyn Gruffydd, senior coroner for Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, said: “I recognise the concerns raised by the family that the crucial answer to their question was hampered by a lack of preserved material.”</p> <p>He said he would write to the police and the HSE asking them to draft a memorandum of understanding on how to preserve evidence for future investigations, while not compromising rescue efforts.</p> <p>He said: “It’s only by learning lessons in incidents such as this that steps can be put in place to avoid or reduce the risk of future deaths.”</p> <p>Claire Bennett, who lived next door, was sitting on her sofa when the explosion happened in March 2023.</p> <p>She told the inquest: “Instantly, Brian’s house disappeared. They didn’t even know there was an end house when I first came out. I explained there was an end house and if the white van is there, then Brian’s there.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>iPhone upgrade joined by watchOS 26, iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 Tahoe, adding a new look and features to devices</p>",
    "content": "<p>Apple will release some of the biggest software updates for its iPhone, iPad and smartwatch on Monday, radically changing the way icons, the lock screen and the system looks, as well as adding features for compatible devices.</p> <p>Announced at the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/apple-wwdc-new-phone-features\">developer conference in June</a>, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and macOS 26 Tahoe introduce Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, giving everything a softer, more rounded and semi-transparent look that has proved divisive.</p> <p>Here’s what you need to know about the updates.</p> <h2>When can I get it?</h2> <p>Downloads for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS updates usually start at about 6pm UK time (1pm in New York; 3am in Sydney). Unlike other manufacturers, all eligible Apple devices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion.</p> <h2>Which devices can get it?</h2> <p>All Apple smartphones from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone\">2019’s iPhone 11</a> or newer can install iOS 26. All tablets from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/12/apple-129in-ipad-pro-review-bringing-back-the-wow-factor\">2018 iPad Pro</a> or 2019 iPad Air (3rd gen), iPad mini (5th gen) or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/30/apple-ipad-2020-review-tablet-faster-cost\">iPad (8th gen)</a> and newer can install iPadOS 26. All Apple Watches from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/05/apple-watch-series-6-review-faster-cheaper-still-the-best\">2020’s Series 6</a> or newer can install watchOS 26. All <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/09/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-gamechanging-speed-and-battery-life\">MacBook Airs from 2020</a>, 16in MacBook Pros from 2019, 13in MacBook Pros from 2020, Mac minis from 2020, iMacs from 2020, Mac Studios from 2022 and the 2019 Mac Pro or later can install macOS 26 Tahoe.</p> <h2>How do I get it?</h2> <p>Open the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad then navigate to General &gt; Software Update. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to finish. You can also install the update using a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer.</p> <p>WatchOS 26 requires an iPhone 11 or later to be running iOS 26 first. Then open the Watch app on the phone and navigate to General &gt; Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update.</p> <p>Macs are updated in System Settings, navigate to General &gt; Software Update.</p> <h2>How much will it cost?</h2> <p>The updates are free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is a scam.</p> <h2>What happened to iOS 19 to 25?</h2> <p>Apple has switched to a new year-based naming format for its software. That means iOS 18 and others that were released in September 2024 for the 2024-2025 period are being replaced with iOS 26 et al for 2025-2026. It’s a bit like sports seasons now.</p> <h2>Liquid Glass everywhere</h2> <p>All of Apple’s operating systems now sport the same semi-translucent design that looks a little like frosted glass bubbles floating above a flat background, bringing the depth-based interface from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/20/vision-pro-review-apple-cutting-edge-headset-lives-up-to-the-hype\">Vision Pro headset</a> to the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. Icons, notification banners, buttons and menus are more rounded with a sheen to them that reacts to movement, allowing you to partly see through them to your wallpaper, app or content beneath.</p> <h2>iOS 26</h2>    <p>The Liquid Glass redesign has changed the shape and look of the icons and widgets on the home screen. In addition to the reworked standard app icons, you can now turn them all colourless and translucent, tint them with your choice of colour or use a dark version of the original icon.</p> <p>Notifications and other elements now bounce into view from the top of the screen. Widgets display at the bottom of the lockscreen and the clock can dynamically scale in size depending on how many notifications take up the display.</p> <h2>Dynamic and hiding buttons</h2> <p>Various buttons now shrink away when you don’t interact with them. For example, the camera app has been streamlined to hide additional modes behind a slider or big pop-up menus. The address bar and navigation buttons in Safari now condense down to a small button at the bottom of the screen as you scroll. To get to your tabs and controls you need to swipe the address bar button upwards or press the three-dot button.</p> <h2>Filter spam more easily</h2>    <p>The phone app can automatically screen calls from unknown numbers with the iPhone answering and asking for their name and reason for calling before alerting you so you can decide not to pick up. Messages can now screen texts from new senders and detect spam, filtering them out to separate inboxes. The phone app can also wait on hold for you until a customer services agent picks up and is ready to speak to you.</p> <p>The phone app, FaceTime and messages now all have live translation built in too.</p> <h2>Games app</h2> <p>A new Games app acts as the home for gaming on the iPhone. It contains your games library, highlights what your friends are playing and replaces Game Centre for tracking achievements, competitions and other gaming events.</p> <h2>iPadOS 26</h2>    <p>The iPad gets the same visual redesign as the iPhone with clear icons and hiding buttons, but with more dramatic changes to the way <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/os/ipados/\">iPadOS 26</a> works thanks to new multitasking capabilities designed for those that use an iPad as a computer replacement.</p> <h2>Mac-like menu bar and full windowing</h2>    <p>One big new addition to the iPad is the menu bar and window management abilities from the Mac. Swipe down from the centre of the top of the screen in an app to reveal its menu bar with all of the various functions, including the familiar settings, file, edit, view, window and help menus from the Mac.</p> <p>It also has Apple’s traditional red, yellow and green three-dot menu for closing, minimising, shrinking or expanding the window. Press and hold the buttons to reveal tiling and moving controls, just like a Mac, or manually resize and move the window to any position you’d like. Swipe up and hold for Exposé, flick an app to the left or right to snap it to the side of the screen, or flick it up to go full screen.</p> <p>You can open multiple windows and have them overlap, tile them side-by-side or just have a mess with the home screen acting like the desktop on a Mac.</p> <h2>Preview and Files app</h2> <p>The Files app has been revamped to make it easier to manage documents and files on your iPad, including being able to set the default app for opening particular file types as you would on a computer. Folders such as Downloads or Documents can be added directly to the Dock for easier access.</p> <p>The Mac’s Preview app has been brought to the iPad, which can handle PDFs, images and various other documents, allowing you to view, edit or mark them up with an Apple Pencil.</p> <h2>watchOS 26</h2>    <p>The glass-like design of the iPhone is even more apparent on the Apple Watch with notification bubbles overlaid on top of the watch face, floating buttons in apps and a softer look to the smart stack of widgets.</p> <h2>Workout Buddy</h2> <p>Apple’s new chatbot for fitness is Workout Buddy, which can talk to you, offering advice and encouragement while exercising similar to an Apple Fitness+ coach. It flags when you’ve hit certain milestones, goals, pace or thresholds during activities, such as a faster last kilometre, and then recaps your workout at the end. It works over Bluetooth headphones connected to the watch and needs an iPhone 15 Pro or later phone nearby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2025/feb/13/best-apple-iphone\">The best iPhones in 2025: which Apple smartphone is right for you, according to our expert</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sleep scores and high blood pressure alerts</h2> <p>The sleep app now generates sleep scores each morning as a one-glance look at how well you slept. For Series 9 or Ultra 2 or later watches, a new blood pressure feature will notify you if it detects signs of hypertension over the last 30-day period.</p> <h2>Wrist flick</h2> <p>Apple has also added a great new gesture to the touch-free gestures available on newer Watches. Turn your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss notifications, alarms and other alerts. It joins the double-tap gesture as handy ways to clear things or use the watch without touching it.</p> <h2>New watch faces</h2>    <p>Three new watch faces have been added. Flow is a large digital face that uses the Liquid Glass design to change colour and react to movement. Exactograph separates hours, minutes and seconds into their own analogue dials in various open or closed forms. The Ultra-exclusive Waypoint encircles the time with a live compass pointing to various landmarks and points of interest. A revamped Photos face is also available with floating numerals.</p> <h2>macOS 26 Tahoe</h2>    <p>MacOS gets most of the new features and design changes made to the iPhone and iPad, including more rounded window corners and glass-like effects.</p> <h2>Phone app</h2>    <p>Apple has brought the full Phone app to the Mac for making calls through wifi calling and the connected iPhone. It shows recent calls, voicemails, contacts and supports the new call screening and hold assist features from the iPhone.</p> <p>Live activities such as sports scores or delivery apps from the iPhone now appear in the menu bar on the Mac.</p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>Actions have now been integrated into the Spotlight search system, which allows you to send messages and emails, create notes, add reminders and other actions straight from the search bar. You can now filter files by type, list them together, find documents on third-party cloud services and browse through apps, files, clipboard history and other bits instead of searching.</p>",

The announcement was a big blow to a life sciences sector hailed by the government as “one of the crown jewels of the economy”.</p> <p>Sanofi, which invests £35m a year in research and development in the UK out of £6.7bn globally, has carried out 50% fewer clinical trials in the country in the past couple of years, despite a large pipeline of new drugs.</p> <p>Six months ago, heartened by the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/04/wes-streeting-plan-rescue-the-nhs\">Wes Streeting’s, three-point plan to fix the health sector</a>, the French firm explored expanding its clinical trials in the UK. But any substantial investment is now on pause until there is “tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive”.</p> <p>Last year, Sanofi closed the laboratories in Cambridge it had acquired with the biotech company, Kymab, and transferred the work to Boston, US.</p> <p>Naish said there was a “battle happening within government” where officials in the health departmentstruggled to make a strong case to the Treasury and officials in the business and science departments were “sympathetic but hand-wringing”.</p> <p>He said: “There needs to be a proper plan from Treasury, sat down with the other departments, for what raising the spend to be more in line with other countries looks like.”</p> <p>The NHS’s outlay on medicines has fallen to 9% of total healthcare spending, compared with 14% in Germany, 15% in the US, and 17% in Italy and Spain.</p> <p>The price thresholds set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the body that assesses which drugs can be offered on the NHS, have not moved since 1999.</p> <p>Naish called for them to be raised, echoing comments from other industry figures, including AstraZeneca’s UK president, Tom Keith-Roach. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the thresholds updated in line with inflation.</p> <p>The industry also wants the clawback rate – drugmakers have to pay back to the NHS between a quarter and a third of their UK revenues – reduced to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> <p>Officials in the DHSC are reportedly attempting to reopen talks with pharmaceutical companies over drug pricing and market access, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53543a40-a2ee-49a5-b395-9572a02120a8\">the Financial Times</a>.

    "content": "<p>The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has refused to be interviewed by the Metropolitan police before his pending release from prison in Germany, the force has said.</p> <p>The Met confirmed it had submitted a formal international request to question Christian Brückner, the 49-year-old German national who has long been under investigation in connection with Madeleine’s disappearance, but the suspect declined.</p> <p>Madeleine went missing in 2007 from a holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, shortly after being put to bed by her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, while they dined with friends at a nearby restaurant. She was three years old.</p> <p>Brückner remains a suspect in Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange inquiry, which continues alongside investigations led by German and Portuguese authorities. Police in all three countries have carried out searches in Portugal over the years, most recently near the municipality of Lagos in June 2023. Investigators have also combed areas around the Barragem do Arade reservoir, 30 miles from Praia da Luz, where Brückner was known to have spent time.</p> <p>DCI Mark Cranwell, the senior investigating officer for Operation Grange, said officers would continue their work despite the suspect’s refusal to cooperate.</p> <p>“For a number of years we have worked closely with our policing colleagues in Germany and Portugal to investigate the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and support Madeleine’s family to understand what happened on the evening of 3 May 2007 in Praia da Luz,” Cranwell said.</p> <p>“We are aware of the pending release from prison of a 49-year-old German man who has been the primary suspect in the German federal investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance. We can confirm that this individual remains a suspect in the Metropolitan police’s own investigation.</p> <p>“We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an international letter of request which has been submitted. It was subsequently refused.</p> <p>“In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry. We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing.”</p> <p>Brückner is serving a seven-year sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in Praia da Luz in 2005 and could be released on Wednesday. He has consistently denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p> <p>Between 2000 and 2017, Brückner lived intermittently in southern Portugal, and prosecutors have confirmed he was in the Algarve around the time Madeleine vanished. German authorities have described him as their chief suspect, though he has not been charged in connection with the case.</p> <p>Last October, a German court acquitted him of unrelated sexual offences alleged to have taken place in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.</p> <p>Since its launch in 2011, Operation Grange has received more than £13.2m in Home Office funding after a further £108,000 was secured from the government in April.</p> <p>Madeleine’s case remains one of the most high-profile unsolved disappearances of recent decades, attracting international attention and repeated appeals for information.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Exclusive: The duke talks about the cost of war, his portrayal in the press and boxing as the Guardian joins him on a visit to Kyiv</p>",
    "content": "<p>It’s about midnight. It’s raining. A small group is huddled around a lonely roadside cafe somewhere near the border between Poland and Ukraine, getting wet in the drizzle, sharing cartons of chips and bottles of beer.</p> <p>One of the bedraggled men wonders out loud why on earth the owner of the cafe would choose to close now, when surely this must have been the busiest it has ever been, stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, with a captive and hungry audience.</p> <p>Everyone laughs. It turns out, Prince Harry can be quite funny.</p> <p>It helps to keep things jolly as the security detail work out how to ferry everyone from here to the train that will take them on a secretly planned trip to Kyiv.</p>    <p>The aim of the visit is to promote the work of the Duke of Sussex’s Invictus Games Foundation (IGF), and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of the thousands of veterans there who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago.</p> <p>Because of the sheer numbers of wounded, Invictus has become increasingly well-known in Ukraine, and Harry, somewhat surprisingly, has achieved cult-hero status.</p> <p>The Guardian accompanies him on the journey to the capital – something of a gamble for both sides, as Harry noted. He is suspicious of the media, and the Guardian has long been critical of the monarchy.</p> <p>And over the next 36 hours, we learn a lot – big and small – about this complex, conflicted man. He doesn’t like posing for staged photographs, and he doesn’t like cycling (“I have a bony ass”); he likes to box to relieve his frustration – “hitting the hell out of a bag”, he says, helps him to decompress.</p>    <p>In private he is very informal, padding around in his socks on the train to and from Kyiv and making dad jokes.</p> <p>In public he has a confident voice and an easy charm with strangers, but on his own he is softly spoken and asks questions about people, and about politics. He has views.</p> <p>He is not, he says, the unhappy man some of the press like to portray him as, but yes, he wants to spend more time in the UK.</p> <p>Does he regret putting his side of the story in the very public way that he has? No he doesn’t. “My conscience is clear.”</p> <p>He talks a little about his mother, Diana, and his father too. If Invictus is his professional priority, it seems clear his father is a personal one.</p> <p>But all that comes out on the way back to the UK; what is happening in Ukraine is his immediate concern, and for good reason.</p> <h2><strong>‘One of the saddest things I have ever seen. Also one of the most beautiful’</strong></h2>    <p>The statistics are shocking and they are on the rise.</p> <p>The war in Ukraine has left at least 130,000 people with life-changing injuries, many of them double and triple amputees or with disfigured faces.</p> <p>With no sign of the conflict ending, the Ukrainian government has put using sport as a way to help the recovery and rehabilitation of these veterans at the heart of a national policy, and the country’s prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, has turned to Invictus for inspiration and help.</p>        <p>Ukrainians themselves have embraced the whole concept. The men and women who have taken part in the biennial Invictus Games have become national heroes and front-page news.</p> <p>But these competitions only involve small numbers, and the need is vast.</p> <p>So Invictus has been devising programmes to help veterans all over the country get access to sports facilities. At a reception on Friday morning, the IGF team are guests at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, where they meet ministers and dozens of the recovering wounded.</p>      <p>“Sports recovery and rehabilitation did not exist in Ukraine before Invictus,” Ruslan Prykhodko, the deputy minister for veterans affairs, tells the Guardian.</p> <p>“Now we are creating a whole system with different kinds of training and preparing teams in all kinds of sports.”</p>    <p>And it’s here that Harry’s popularity among Ukrainians becomes very clear.</p> <p>The injured want to talk to him, the mothers and fathers of the wounded and dead want to shake his hand, or hug him. He is cheered and clapped at every turn, as are his colleagues.</p>    <p>“It’s amazing. We never expected this level of recognition,” says Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans trauma centre in Lviv, which has worked closely with Invictus in Ukraine.</p> <p>“Ordinary people know who he is. We honestly didn’t know he had become such a celebrity. I think Prince Harry coming here is a symbol of victory and power. People look at him and his military experience and they see he is not afraid to come to Ukraine. It is so important that he came.”</p>    <p>For this, and for the other causes he is passionate about, Harry accepts his “front and centre” role and does it willingly. Encouraging those who have been seriously injured to find a purpose outside the military is one of his messages.</p> <p>“I would say that I have been fortunate,” he says. “The one thing that people miss when they hang up their uniform is purpose.</p> <p>“Losing a sense of community and being part of a team, and of course the camaraderie and adrenaline. But at the heart of it is your job, your role is serving a purpose larger than yourself.”</p> <p>His work for Invictus, he says, has given him that after his military career. It “saved me”.</p>    <p>Changing attitudes across society about disabled people is another core message.</p> <p>“Seeing people with prosthetics and life-changing injuries is going to be the norm in Ukraine for the coming decades,” he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>“Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities. It’s about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.”</p> <p>Such is the need for men and women to fight the war, some of the wounded have even ended up back in the military.</p> <p>“A lot of the participants in the Invictus Games go back to active service,” says Helen D’Oyley, the IGF’s chief growth officer. “Ukraine has become our key strategic priority because of the need there is here.”</p> <p>Later in the day, the team stops at Maidan Square in the heart of Kyiv, where an unofficial memorial to the dead has sprung up. It is a moving and ever growing field of photos of the dead, flags, messages and flowers.</p> <p>Harry wanted to lay a wreath, but as the crowds grow around him, he steps into the thick of the memorial to be on his own.</p>    <p>“I wanted to find a spot to lay the wreath in peace away from everyone. My God it’s like a maze in there. I didn’t appreciate how far back it went. Honestly, it is one of the saddest things I have ever seen. But also one of the most beautiful.” The war, he suggests, could and should have been avoided. “It is all so unnecessary.”</p> <p>After this visit, the prince disappears. His car heads off away from the convoy for about an hour and when he returns to the group, he is coy and tight-lipped.</p> <p>The suspicion is that he has gone to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but neither he nor the president wants to admit it.</p> <p>Zelenskyy is a champion of the Invictus Games and had made it known he wanted to meet the prince. The British government had made it known to Zelenskyy it would rather he did not. That was the chat in diplomatic circles, at least.</p> <p>The theory was that giving the rebel royal a platform might not be smart politics on a day that Britain’s new foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was also in town.</p> <p>But only one Briton is making any headlines in Ukraine on Friday.</p>    <h2><strong>‘I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live</strong><strong>’</strong></h2> <p>The trip to Kyiv comes at the end of a busy week for Harry.</p> <p>From Monday to Thursday he was in the UK, undertaking a series of events related to the causes he supports. He also met his father, King Charles, for the first time since February 2024. On an overnight train heading back to Poland, Harry says he thinks the whole week has gone well, and feels hopeful about the future.</p> <p>During the trip, some elements of the tabloid press have published stories that left his team with their heads in their hands.</p> <p>It appears to make Harry more certain of the need to take on the papers who, he says, have unfairly targeted him and his family.</p> <p>The prince, along with Doreen Lawrence and Elton John among others, is suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>A trial is due to start in January.</p> <p>“Yes, I have enjoyed the week,” says Harry. “I have always loved the UK and I always will love the UK. It’s been good to reconnect with the causes I am passionate about. I have been able to spend some time with people that I have known for so long. It is hard to do it from far away.”</p> <p>He adds: “It is only in certain elements of the press where you see this talk about me being down or saying I am not smiling. This comes from people who think they know what I am thinking and how I am feeling. They are wrong.</p> <p>“I think parts of the British press want to believe that I am miserable, but I’m not. I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live.”</p> <p>If he hasn’t always seemed cheerful, then that is hardly surprising, given what he has been going through, he says.</p> <p>“I have certainly had to deal with some very stressful events over the last four years. There has been the uncertainty and stress of the litigation and finding out certain things that have really, really hurt.”</p> <p>But he believes there is a disconnect between what is written about him by some commentators, and what most other people think.</p>    <p>“I feel a lot of support from the British public. Even now, when I feel like I have been destroyed by certain members of the British press.</p> <p>“It serves them to think that the British public feels the same way about me as they do.</p> <p>“But I don’t feel that and I don’t see that. For as long as I have known, certain elements of the British press have tried to speak on behalf of the nation. I think they are out of touch with the nation on lots of things.</p> <p>“They hope to bring the public with them, but … I think the British public can speak and think for themselves.”</p> <p>Would he like to spend more time in the UK? To bring his children one day, despite the issues over his security arrangements?</p> <p>“Yes I would. This week has definitely brought that closer.”</p> <p>Harry won’t talk about his father, but he seems to suggest he wants, and needs, to see his father more often.</p> <p>Over the coming year, he says, “the focus really has to be on my dad”.</p> <p>Harry mentions his wife, Meghan, only once by name, a reference to something she told him about how telling the truth “is the most efficient way to live”.</p> <p>“She said ‘just stick to the truth’. It is the thing I always fall back on. Always.</p> <p>“And if you think like that, who would be stupid enough to lie? It takes up too much time and effort.”</p> <p>Which brings him to the very public things he has said about his life; the interviews, the TV series and the book he wrote, Spare.</p> <p>“I know that [speaking out] annoys some people and it goes against the narrative. The book? It was a series of corrections to stories already out there. One point of view had been put out and it needed to be corrected.”</p> <p>He adds: “I don’t believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.”</p> <p>Being called stubborn slightly rankles with him. “It’s not stubbornness, it is having principles.”</p> <p>It seems he does not want to prolong any legal battles.</p> <p>He does not ever expect to get positive coverage from some quarters – a ceasefire is, perhaps, the best he can hope for.</p> <p>“It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,” he says.</p> <p>Nor does he want to prolong any divisions with his family.</p> <p>But in life, he says, “you cannot have reconciliation before you have truth”.</p> <p>Harry, who turns 41 on Monday, appears a bit bemused by his popularity in Ukraine.</p>      <p>By the end of the visit he has so many bags of presents to take home, including a dagger hidden inside an ornate walking stick, they take up most of the free space in the back of the private jet that returns him to the UK.</p> <p>He puts it down to the fact he served 10 years in the army, and the way Ukrainians have adopted the ideas of the Invictus Foundation.</p> <p>He is told that Rudnieva thought part of the reason people liked him was because he is quite Ukrainian in his attitude to life: he does his own thing, in his own way.</p> <p>“You know who else did that?” says the prince. “My mum.”</p>",

New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.</p> <p>New models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.</p> <p>Ben Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.</p> <p>“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”</p> <p>He added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”</p> <p>Chery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.</p> <p>Oli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/24/smart-keys-car-crime-thieves-hi-tech-arms-race\">Gone in 20 seconds: how ‘smart keys’ have fuelled a new wave of car crime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for BYD, which in two years of UK sales has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/28/tesla-sales-in-europe-slump-byd-new-car-registrations-more-than-triple-elon-musk\">grown to overtake Tesla</a>, said it had worked with Thatcham to learn about UK theft prevention and had “devoted significant efforts to enhancing vehicle anti-theft performance and insurability in the UK market”.</p> <p>They added: “We have implemented a wide range of technologies and hardware tailored to local expectations, including advanced anti-theft locking systems and optimisations in vehicle component structures.”</p> <p>According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, reported total vehicle theft in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables\">rose to 102,000</a> in the year to the end of March 2025.</p> <p>Chinese car crime data is not available, and while its official crime statistics are viewed as unreliable, anecdotally vehicle and other theft is perceived as far lower than in Britain.</p> <p>A spokesperson for International Motors, a UK distributor that imports Xpeng and GWM cars from China, said Korean and Japanese manufacturers had faced similar adjustments when first exporting here years before: “The UK requirements for safety and security are extremely stringent.”</p> <p>The UK’s most stolen car, however, is one that was once made in Britain: the Ford Fiesta, with more than 4,000 taken last year, according to Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures reported by What Car?</p>",

    "description": "<p>Top-spec cameras, cutting edge AI, great software and stunning screen squeezed into a more manageable frame</p>",
    "content": "<p>The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s best phone that is still a pocketable, easy-to-handle size, taking the excellent Pixel 10 and beefing it up in the camera department.</p> <p>That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold.</p> <p>The 10 Pro looks almost identical to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/02/pixel-9-pro-review-small-phone-camera-google-android-ai\">last year’s version</a> and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">as the Pixel 10</a> but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling.</p>    <p>The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">Google Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat\">used in rivals</a>. Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates.</p> <p>The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left.</p>    <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Google Tensor G5</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 16</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 207g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Android 16 with AI everywhere</h2>    <p>The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705\">until August 2032</a>, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">regular Pixel 10</a> with a bold, colourful and fun design.</p> <p>Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy.</p> <p>The advanced <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/gemini-ai-assistant/\">Gemini chatbot</a> is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice.</p>    <p>But the standout new feature is <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/articles/magic-cue/\">Magic Cue</a>, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them.</p> <p>Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16476811\">Google AI Pro</a>, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>    <p>The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is.</p> <p>The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions.</p> <p>Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too.</p>    <p>Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable.</p> <p>When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script.</p> <p>The camera app adds <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\">C2PA content credentials</a> to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing.</p> <p>The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The battery <a href=\"https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/smartphonestablets20231669/2347995\">will last in excess</a> of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.

    "content": "<p>An army veteran will stand trial on Monday charged with murder in relation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\">Bloody Sunday</a>, when the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 civil rights protesters in Derry in 1972.</p> <p>The former paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is charged with two murders and five attempted murders during a military operation that became a defining event of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>’s Troubles.</p> <p>He has pleaded not guilty to the murders of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murder of five others.</p>    <p>For families of the dead and wounded, the trial at Belfast crown court is the culmination of 53 years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/bloody-sunday-what-has-happened-in-the-50-years-since-the-killings\">campaigning</a>.</p> <p>Soldiers shot 31 civilians in Derry on 30 January 1972. Thirteen died that day. Another casualty who died four months later is widely considered a 14th victim.</p> <p>A tribunal led by Lord Widgery in 1972 cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing but a 2010 inquiry by Lord Saville concluded that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”. The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-report-saville-inquiry\">apologised</a> for the killings. Plays, films, books, documentaries and annual commemorations have kept Bloody Sunday in public consciousness.</p> <p>A court order granted Soldier F anonymity after defence lawyers argued he would be a “prized target” for dissident republicans if his identity was made public. When he appeared in court for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/06/bloody-sunday-ex-soldier-pleads-not-guilty-to-double-in-belfast-trial\">arraignment in December 2024</a>, he sat in a witness box that was shielded from the main body of the court by a thick floor-to-ceiling blue curtain. Similar arrangements are expected for the trial.</p> <p>Mr Justice Fowler will preside over the case without a jury, which is permitted in exceptional cases.</p> <p>At a pre-trial hearing in March, Soldier F’s legal team argued that inconsistencies in accounts by his fellow paratroopers and civilian witnesses meant there was insufficient evidence for a trial.</p>    <p>Prosecutors said “contestable evidence” would be addressed during the trial and that there was “overwhelming evidence” regarding Soldier F’s actions on the day the army opened fire on protesters in Derry’s Bogside.</p> <p>Authorising the case to proceed, Fowler said he accepted evidence that indicated that soldiers in Glenfada Park acted unlawfully in firing with high-velocity rifles at a group of unarmed civilians in a relatively confined courtyard. “In my view, it provides a sufficiency of evidence and it is not tenuous. Accordingly, the court discerns that the committal papers disclose a case sufficient to put the defendant on trial in respect of each of the seven counts on the indictment,” he said.</p> <p>The case will be closely watched by families of those who died on Bloody Sunday and veterans’ groups, as well as the Irish and British governments. London and Dublin are discussing ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/14/legacy-act-halted-investigations-into-202-troubles-related-killings-of-british-soldiers\">repeal the Legacy Act</a>, which was an attempt by the previous Conservative government to phase out prosecutions for Troubles-era alleged crimes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Autumnal equinox arrives in northern hemisphere this week, but we must wait a few more days for the equilux</p>",
    "content": "<p>So that’s it for the summer. The season comes to a close for us in the northern hemisphere this week on 22 September as we enter the autumn.</p> <p>The moment is marked by the autumnal equinox, which is the moment when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving south, and the days become shorter than the nights. The exact moment this happens is 19:19 BST on 22 September and it is caused by the movement of Earth along its orbit, gradually tilting the northern hemisphere away from the sun.</p> <p>The name equinox comes from the Latin aequus, meaning equal and nox, meaning night. Hence it is said that the equinox is when day and night are the same length, which would be true if Earth had no atmosphere.</p> <p>The effect of the air we breathe is to bend the light from the sun, so we actually see our parent star on the horizon before it has actually risen, and then again just after it sets. This gives a few extra minutes of daylight at the equinox.</p> <p>A few days later, the lengths of the day and the night really are equal. This is known as the equilux, and occurs on either 25 or 26 September depending on your precise location.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Consumer group says uncertified car seats that put lives of children in danger are being sold by leading online retailers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unregulated children’s car seats are being sold by leading online retailers in the UK, a Which? investigation has found.</p> <p>The consumer group discovered products for sale on platforms including eBay, Shein, Wish, Little Dreams and ManoMano that did not carry the orange certification labels showing compliance with regulation. Without these markings, parents cannot be sure the seats have been tested to the legal standard.</p> <p>Which? said the car seats were putting children’s lives at risk. Many were priced between £12.50 and £40, below the £80 starting price of certified models, leading to fears that families under financial pressure may choose to buy them.</p> <p>The organisation first exposed flimsy fabric seats in 2014 that collapsed in crash tests, prompting their removal at the time. It says the reappearance of uncertified models shows how unsafe or illegal products can slip back on to the market.</p> <p>While the latest examples have not been put through formal testing, Which? said the lack of regulatory labels raised doubts about whether they were safe or legal to use.</p> <p>There were two seats without regulatory labels on sale on the online marketplace ManoMano, four on eBay, two on Wish.com and one on Shein and Little Dreams. Shein, eBay, Wish and Little Dreams removed the listings once they were flagged.</p> <p>The safety defects in these car seats include a thin seat base and not having one central point of release for the harness. Car seats must raise a child’s height to position the seatbelt correctly across their lap, and multiple buckles on the harness can make it difficult to rescue a child in the event of a crash.</p> <p>The seats also have a lack of side impact protection, which is needed to stop a child’s head from hitting the inside of the car. This omission leaves children vulnerable to head trauma or death in the event of a side impact, Which? said.</p> <p>Researchers at the consumer group also found confusing listings that described the items as car seats but included small-print disclaimers advising against their use in vehicles. One read: “Note: it is best not to use it on high-speed cars. We recommend that it be used in non-motorized products such as electric vehicles … Because it is not a child safety seat that complies with traffic.”</p> <p>The warning comes after the Product Regulation and Metrology Act, which strengthens consumer safety rules, received royal assent earlier this year. Which? is urging the government to introduce secondary regulations giving online marketplaces direct responsibility for ensuring goods sold on their sites meet safety requirements. It also wants stronger enforcement powers for regulators.</p> <p>Experts advise parents to: check that any seat has an approval label showing it complies with either ECE R44-03, R44-04 or R129 standards; avoid secondhand models that may have hidden crash damage; buy from reputable retailers that can advise on fitting; and be cautious of unusually cheap options.</p> <p>An eBay spokesperson said they “swiftly removed the listings reported by Which? and notified buyers. We have updated our existing measures accordingly and remain committed to preventing unsafe products from appearing on the site.”</p> <p>Shein said it took product safety “very seriously”, adding: “This product category is banned across Shein sites globally. In this situation, the seller had undertaken specific and targeted measures to avoid detection, in violation of our code of conduct. Upon being notified of the non-compliant product listing, Shein dealt with the situation immediately and removed the product listing.”</p> <p>Little Dreams did not provide a comment but told Which? it would review the product in question, remove the listing from its website, and conduct a thorough internal investigation to understand how this occurred.</p> <p>Wish said “the safety and wellbeing of our users is our foremost priority. We can confirm that all product listings highlighted have been removed.”</p> <p>ManoMano said it was “committed to the safety” of customers. However, it said products were “sold by the sellers under their sole responsibility … ManoMano acts solely as a technical intermediary … we are deeply committed to the safety of our customers and promptly remove any illegal products once we receive proper notification”. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The legend that Cornish vanished as a living language with the death of the fish seller <a href=\"https://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/people/dolly_pentreath.htm\">Dolly Pentreath</a> in the late 18th century is being challenged by one of the world’s leading experts on the Celtic culture of the far south-west of Britain.</p> <p>Pentreath, from the harbourside town of Mousehole on the Cornish south coast, died in 1777 aged 85 and the narrative developed that she was the last true speaker of <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-news/environment-culture-and-planning/learn-how-to-speak-kernewek-20-cornish-words-and-phrases-to-get-you-started/\">Kernewek</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/centres/ics/whoweare/kensa-broadhurst/\">Kensa Broadhurst</a>, of the Institute of Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter, has written a book in which she argues that the language <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90371-7\">clung on through the 19th century</a>, spoken by some working-class Cornish people as well as academics and others who saw value in preserving it.</p> <p>Broadhurst said that during that period Cornish should be classified as having been critically endangered rather than extinct. “The story of the Cornish language is one of resilience, not disappearance,” she said.</p> <p>Broadhurst, a bard of <a href=\"https://gorsedhkernow.org.uk/\">the Cornish Gorsedh</a>, which promotes<strong> </strong>Cornish Celtic culture, said Cornish was widely spoken in the far south-west in medieval times.</p> <p>By the time Pentreath was born in 1692, the number of speakers had dramatically declined, but she was said to have spoken only Cornish until she was in her 20s.</p> <p>Broadhurst said the story of Pentreath had to be treated with caution because her voice has vanished from history and much of what is known of her came from the writings of wealthy outsiders, who may have misrepresented her. “We’re talking about rich, educated men with leisure time,” Broadhurst said.</p> <p>Daines Barrington, an English lawyer, antiquary and naturalist, is generally credited with having “discovered” Pentreath. He reported that she “was bred up from a child to know no other language; nor could she (if we may believe her) talk a word of English before she was past 20 years of age; that, her father being a fisherman, she was sent with fish to Penzance at 12 years old, and sold them in the Cornish language.” Barrington also said she told him that nobody else could converse in Cornish.</p> <p>Broadhurst said it was also possible Pentreath was playing Barrington. “If you’re poor and this smart man who’s obviously got money is showing an interest, are you going to try and milk that? We just don’t know.”</p> <p>In the years after her death, the idea grew that the language had died with Pentreath. In 1860 a monument in her honour was set up in a churchyard describing her as “the last person who conversed in the ancient Cornish”.</p> <p>For her book, The Cornish Language in the Nineteenth Century, Broadhurst studied experts such as Frederick William Pearce Jago, who published a Cornish dictionary in 1887, and the Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner (1848-1934).</p> <p>Broadhurst said she believed Cornish continued to be spoken in the 19th century, albeit in “tiny numbers”. She said: “They were obviously bilingual, mainly speaking English, but they could speak Cornish. There were still people teaching it to their children, there were people doing research on it. It was even being taught in universities in France.”</p> <p>She said it was hard to pinpoint where Cornish was spoken, partly because working-class people with few, if any, reading and writing skills left little trace.</p> <p>Kernewek has enjoyed a 20th- and 21st-century revival, with Cornwall council estimating there are about 500 advanced speakers and more than 2,000 with basic levels.</p> <p>The council said <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-news/environment-culture-and-planning/cornish-culture-is-thriving-across-the-duchy/\">Cornish culture was “thriving”</a>, with more people and events celebrating Cornish food, heritage, sports and music. The likes of the pop singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/08/the-language-is-part-of-my-life-gwenno-shares-songs-in-cornish-to-inspire-new-generation\">Gwenno</a>, who performs in languages including Cornish and Welsh, are helping promote Kernewek.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ex-MPC members say ‘quantitative tightening’ should be scaled back or halted entirely, saving the Treasury up to £10bn a year</p>",
    "content": "<p>Andrew Bailey has been urged by former Bank of England policymakers to ease pressure on the government’s borrowing costs by cutting back its bond-selling plans.</p> <p>In a crunch week for the economy, four influential ex-members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said a change in course was needed.</p> <p>Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">highest level in 27 years</a>, intensifying the pressure on chancellor Rachel Reeves before her 26 November autumn budget.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has blamed the rise on global factors., triggered by Donald Trump’s trade war and his assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>However, the Bank admitted last month that a £100bn programme of bond sales to unwind its crisis-era quantitative easing scheme is also playing a role.</p> <p>With the government under pressure on the economy, the central bank is widely expected to keep its base rate unchanged on Thursday at 4%, but could signal a slowdown in its bond-selling plans for the next 12 months.</p> <p>The Bank’s decision comes in a busy week for economic news, with official data due on the jobs market and inflation, as Reeves gears up for a challenging autumn budget.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former MPC member, now at the consultancy Oxford Economics, urged the Bank to scale back its disposals amid febrile conditions in markets.</p> <p>“It is highly likely they will slow the pace … The gilt market and bond market in general are weak and volatile,” he said. “Current conditions are such that a higher pace of active sales might have an undesirable effect on pushing up yields further.”</p> <p>A second ex-MPC member, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “It definitely has to be reduced. Not reducing it would be completely tone deaf to what’s happening in the global bond markets.”</p> <p>Threadneedle Street intervened during the depths of the financial crisis to buy UK government bonds – aiming to crash borrowing costs close to zero – in a programme that was ultimately expanded up to reach £895bn in total.</p> <p>The Bank is now winding down quantitative easing – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – and has shed about £100bn of bonds in the past year through active sales and allowing maturing debts not to be replaced.</p> <p>It still has a portfolio worth about £560bn, having disposed of most of its holdings at a loss.</p> <p>City investors widely expect the Bank to scale back its QT programme to about £70bn for the year ahead. However, this would involve maintaining active sales at current levels because fewer gilts are due to expire over the next 12 months.</p> <p>Sushil Wadhwani, who was on the MPC between 1999 and 2002, called for a halt to active sales entirely amid worries over the impact of QT on the bond market.</p> <p>“On monetary policy grounds, the Bank should switch to passive QT [only allowing maturing debt to expire],” he said. “Irrespective of what Andrew Bailey says, the 30-year yield has a significant impact on confidence in the UK economy. I have foreign investors bring it up all the time.”</p> <p>Scaling back the Bank’s QT programme could help the chancellor by easing some of the pressure on long-term gilt yields. Such a step would also save the Treasury money because Threadneedle Street has been selling its bonds at a loss.</p> <p>Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, said cutting the Bank’s QT programme to about £70bn was sensible because markets expected such a reduction. However, he warned Reeves against banking on any windfall.</p> <p>“The job of the Bank is not to make the chancellor’s life easy. Its job is to control inflation. And a modest winding back on QT would be quite consistent with that.”</p> <p>In a rare piece of upbeat news for the chancellor, a survey by trade body Make UK suggests an upturn in the key manufacturing sector in the third quarter, with output and export orders rising.</p> <p>Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said all the indicators in the survey, carried out by consultancy BDO, had improved.</p> <p>“After a period of considerable uncertainty in global markets, these figures are an encouraging sign that manufacturers’ confidence is improving and, more importantly, being translated into growth and investment.</p> <p>“However, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and with UK and European markets in particular remaining anaemic it wouldn’t take much to knock prospects for further growth.” </p> <p>The IPPR thinktank has estimated that halting active sales – matching the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank – could save the Treasury more than £10bn a year.</p> <p>However, holding on to the bonds would not be cost free, because the Bank earns less interest on its gilt portfolio than it pays out on commercial bank reserves.</p> <p>Last month, the IPPR called on Reeves to raise taxes on the country’s biggest banks amid windfall profits on their reserves parked at Threadneedle Street. Some economists have also called for the Bank to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/04/a-simple-solution-to-rachel-reeves-spending-cuts-stop-subsidising-the-banks\">pay lower rates of interest</a> on some commercial bank reserves.</p>",

Now councils must only hold a public consultation before scrapping the restrictions, meaning dozens of odd rules have been junked over the past decade.</p> <p>These include a 120-year-old ban on transporting dead horse carcasses in the London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham; a 1956 bylaw prohibiting the drying of clothes in various parks in Whitstable; and a 50-year-old rule outlawing types of fish frying in Gloucester.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Responsibility for vocational training and skills has bounced around Whitehall for years, and enrolment rates are down by a third. Can the latest tweaks work?</p>",
    "content": "<p>Ensuring England’s workforce has the right skills for a rapidly changing economy is key to Labour’s hopes of boosting social mobility and kickstarting economic growth.</p> <p>So it seems unfortunate that more than a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">Keir Starmer’s drastic reshuffle</a>, ministers are still wrangling over exactly which bits of the skills agenda will now move to Pat McFadden’s beefed-up Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p> <p>Broadly speaking, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is expecting to hang on to responsibility for further education, while McFadden will probably take on apprenticeships and adult skills. Jacqui Smith, the skills minister, will work across both departments.</p> <p>Labour market experts say there is some logic to the shift: ensuring the right training is available in the right places is one crucial part of tackling the issue of economic inactivity in a rapidly changing employment market, which falls within the DWP’s bailiwick.</p> <p>But “machinery of government” changes, as official parlance has it, can often bring more disruption than clarity.</p> <p>Over the past two decades alone, responsibility for skills has bounced around Whitehall, from education into the short-lived Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (2007-09) then on to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2009-16), back into education again, and now across to the DWP.</p> <p>Perhaps this nomadic status helps account for successive administrations’ chronic neglect. Government spending on adult education halved between 2011-12 and 2019-20. It then recovered somewhat as the worst years of austerity came to an end, but by last year it was still £1bn down in real terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-construction-workers-the-country-needs-more-of-them-fast\">The Guardian view on construction workers: the country needs more of them, fast | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, despite endless speeches by politicians of all stripes about how vocational skills should have the same status as university (I have sat through quite a few: it is compulsory to mention Germany), the numbers of people completing apprenticeships have collapsed.</p> <p>Official figures show 178,220 people earned an apprenticeship in England in 2023-24, down by more than a third on 2017-18, when the apprenticeship levy was introduced.</p> <p>Recently rebranded as the skills and growth levy, this is charged at 0.5% of the payroll of larger firms. It was meant to encourage a flowering of workplace training, although employers have long complained that it is too rigid.</p> <p>Since Labour came to power, Phillipson has <a href=\"https://find-employer-schemes.education.gov.uk/interim/growth-and-skills-levy\">made some changes</a>, cutting the minimum duration of an apprenticeship to eight months.</p> <p>Enrolment in apprenticeships has risen this year, by just over 2%, but business groups are still hoping for a more substantial shake-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jan/06/warning-of-skills-chasm-amid-huge-uk-regional-divide-in-qualifications\">Warning of ‘skills chasm’ amid huge UK regional divide in qualifications</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Companies have their own significant part to play, too. It must surely be a piece of the UK’s productivity puzzle that, <a href=\"https://learningandwork.org.uk/resources/research-and-reports/raising-the-bar-increasing-employer-investment-in-skills/\">according to the Learning and Work Institute</a>, employers’ annual spending on training for each member of staff has fallen by 28% in real terms since 2005, to £1,530, a level less than half the EU average.</p> <p>The longtime education expert Sir Philip Augur put it well in a recent <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/are-kids-ok-college-years\">Institute for Fiscal Studies podcast</a> about post-16 education. Welcoming the changes to the apprenticeship levy, Augur said: “Employers have to step up to the plate here. For employers, ‘I can’t get the staff’ is quite often an excuse for bad management. Now, on this occasion, they can’t get the staff because the skills aren’t there. But there needs to be honesty and self-appraisal on the part of employers.”</p> <p>Augur called for the levy to rise “very slightly” to free up more resources for expanding apprenticeships.</p> <p>McFadden’s team say he is keen to ensure young people get the skills they need to benefit from the jobs scheduled to be created by new government investment in defence and green energy. That will mean working with firms and unions to get the training landscape right.</p> <p>There is plenty of innovative thinking going on at local level. The West Yorkshire mayor, Tracy Brabin, announced plans last week for what she called “skills-led growth” in Wakefield, the UK’s largest city without a university.</p> <p>She hopes to <a href=\"https://www.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/all-news-and-blogs/wakefield-sets-out-plan-for-skills-led-growth-to-transform-uk-economy/\">establish a new Wakefield Futures Centre</a>, led by employers, where local people can do courses directly linked to finding work in the fastest-growing sectors in the surrounding economy. The idea is to make the courses flexible so that adults with caring responsibilities, for example, can take up the offer. </p> <p>This kind of relatively fluid, employer-connected approach could allow mums to pick up new skills, or older workers to switch sector or dip their toe in the market after a period off sick, for example.</p> <p>It could also be used to tempt young people to think about a wider set of options: in Manchester, Andy Burnham is pushing to set up an Mbacc – an Ebacc equivalent, intended to be an alternative to GCSEs, which is tailored to local jobs.</p> <p>Jobcentres, which are getting a rejig under Labour to present a more encouraging face, can then signpost to local opportunities such as these.</p> <p>Getting the skills offer right will have to form one crucial part of any genuine effort to bring down the UK’s unusually high economic inactivity rates, and therefore, ultimately, the welfare bill.</p> <p>Last year’s crass attempt at cuts failed because Labour could not justify to its own MPs the crude way in which it planned to cut eligibility for the personal independence payment (Pip).</p> <p>If the government wants to have another go – as McFadden certainly does – then a fresh skills and training offer could be part of the package for the hard-to-reach claimants Labour said it had a “moral case” to help last time&nbsp;– but for whom across-the-board Pip cuts would have done nothing.</p> <p>It’s not a quick fiscal fix by any means, but get it right and the upside, for individuals, employers and the economy, would be significant and long-lasting. The sooner ministers can clear up who takes on which bits of the task, and crack on with it, the better.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Research shows most patients can read extra lines on eye test charts after twice-daily treatment</p>",
    "content": "<p>Doctors have developed special eye drops for people with longsightedness that could replace the need for reading glasses or surgery.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have presbyopia, which is when the eyes find it difficult to focus on objects and text up close. Glasses or surgery can usually resolve the problem but many find wearing spectacles inconvenient and having an operation is not an option for everyone.</p> <p>Now experts say the solution could be as simple as using eye drops twice a day.</p> <p>A study presented on Sunday at the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) in Copenhagen showed that most people could read extra lines on eye test charts after using the drops. The improvement was sustained for two years.</p> <p>The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.</p> <p>The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.</p> <p>The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.</p> <p>They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.</p> <p>In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.</p> <p>Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.</p> <p>“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”</p> <p>The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.</p> <p>Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches. </p> <p>Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”</p>",

To thrive, fruit trees need heat and light and this year “we had lots of both”.</p> <p>“I’ve had boughs breaking on trees under the weight of fruit,” Butterfield continued. “It’s probably going to be the best vintage since 2018.” </p> <p>With more than 20 years in the business, he declared: “It might even be the best in my cider-making lifetime. We’re looking at an incredibly special year.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">Core principles: the return of ‘real’ cider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The National Association of Cider Makers (NACM) says the warm spring and summer have produced apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness”, despite the fact that the reduced rainfall means the fruit is slightly smaller than average.</p> <p>“I’ve heard from cider makers and growers that the sugar and tannin levels are very high, which means the quality of the fruit will be outstanding,” said the NACM chair, David Sheppy, who is also the managing director of Sheppy’s Cider. “It is going to be a good year for quality.”</p> <p>The record-breaking summer temperatures this year that contributed to the abundance of apples was made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change, the Met Office concluded in an analysis published earlier this month. The mean temperature across June, July and August was 16.1C (70F), significantly above the current record of 15.8C set in 2018, with the country also seeing four heatwaves across a single season.</p>    <p>Sheppy, whose family has 36 hectares (90 acres) of orchards in Somerset, said the trees had “suffered a little bit”. Mature trees “don’t mind a dry spell”, he said, but the stress of the dry weather meant he had observed a small number that had split and lost their branches.</p> <p>Cider-producers have moved to make the most of this year’s bumper crop. Sandford Orchards, which makes Devon Red cider, has installed eight new 50,000-litre (11,000-gallon) tanks and Butterfield is particularly excited to have lots of Tremlett’s Bitter apples, meaning Sandford Orchards can bottle a single variety for the first time in seven years.</p> <p>He describes their “leathery and marmaladey” notes and “rich natural sweetness”.</p> <p>There is also good news for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/06/perry-pear-cider-round-up-fiona-beckett-drinks\">perry</a> drinkers after last year’s disaster. Albert Johnson, director of Ross-on-Wye Cider &amp; Perry Company bills it as a “bounceback year”.</p> <p>“Last year was so bad for perry pears, probably over half the crop was wiped out by the bad conditions in the growing season,” he said.</p>    <p>It is a different story this year. “If anything, the pear sugars are up even more than the apples, and there’s plenty of them. So it’s a really exciting year for perry.”</p> <p>Industry figures show that while UK cider sales edged up slightly to £3.1bn in 2024, the overall amount drunk declined by about 3% to 676m litres. Sheppy, the sixth generation of his family to work in cider-making, said the industry “had been in decline, but it’s picking up again”.</p> <p>“It’s coming back,” he said of the sector, which supports about 65,000 jobs. “There’s a lot of innovation and new ideas, both around reducing alcohol content but also at the higher end … to appeal to the modern drinker.</p> <p>“Like a lot of industries, cider goes through phases. But there’s a strong passion for the industry in this country. It’s a close connection with the land and farmers.”</p> <p>Sheppy’s harvest started at the end of last week. “We grow 40 different varieties of apples,” he said. “The earliest ones are ripening now but the main cider apple varieties, like Dabinett, Harry Masters and Yarlington Mill, are ready mid- to late October, early November. That’s the key time.”</p> <p>But even if this year is one to remember, Sheppy is keen to point out that the industry doesn’t have “bad years”, only “bad harvests”.</p> <p>“It’s not like when you get a wetter harvest, the quality is not as good, because that’s all in the blending process. We can blend a good year with a bad year and maintain the quality, that is part of the art of being a cider maker.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>There comes a time in every punk’s life when they are no longer the snarling face of the <em>avant garde</em>. </p> <p>In the UK beer community, opinion is divided about exactly when that sobering moment arrived for BrewDog, the self-styled “punk” brewery founded in Scotland in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/04/brewdog-posts-37m-loss-as-sales-growth-slows-to-just-1\">whose once-fizzing sales are now turning flat</a>.</p> <p>Some point to the <a href=\"https://www.punkswithpurpose.org/\">2021 open letter</a> by Punks with Purpose, a group of BrewDog staff who claimed to have endured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/10/brewdog-staff-craft-beer-firm-letter\">a toxic “culture of fear”</a>, engendered by the company’s bombastic and showmanlike founder James Watt.</p> <p>“For those who had given them the benefit of the doubt, that was the moment when people thought that they don’t deserve to be held up as a paragon of independent beer,” says Matt Curtis, the founding editor of the drinks magazine Pellicle.</p>    <p>Others go back further, to when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/09/punk-beermaker-brewdog-sells-22-of-firm-to-private-equity-house\">investment group TSG Consumer Partners paid £213m for a 22.3% stake</a> in 2017. To the chagrin of some, BrewDog continued soliciting investment from the crowdfunders who had fuelled its initial growth, even after taking the private equity money.</p> <p>“That was a tipping point,” says the beer and food writer Melissa Cole. “After a private equity company has invested, can you still go back to the well of your fans?”</p> <p>Watt’s personal and professional antics since stepping down as chief executive last year, broadcast relentlessly on social media, seem to have completed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/08/little-remains-of-brewdogs-punk-ethos-as-co-founder-james-watt-steps-down\">migration into the establishment</a>.</p> <p>“I compare the history of post-punk music with craft beer,” says Pete Brown, a beer writer and author of Tasting Notes: The Art and Science of Pairing Beer and Music.</p> <p>“I’ve got a slide with [former Sex Pistols frontman] John Lydon doing the Country Life butter commercial next to a picture of James Watt attending Nigel Farage’s birthday party.</p> <p>“It’s like the French Revolution … inevitably the revolutionaries become the reactionaries.”</p> <h2>Peak BrewDog</h2> <p>Views may differ about when the brewer lost its countercultural credentials, but there is little dissent among beer connoisseurs about one thing: we have reached – and probably passed – peak BrewDog.</p> <p>Outside what Brown calls the “beer bubble”, though, the hangover from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/24/the-aggressive-outrageous-infuriating-and-ingenious-rise-of-brewdog\">raucous growth story</a> that defined the company for so long is only just setting in.</p> <p>Since it was founded, sales have grown every year by at least 9% – and often at a much more rapid clip – even during the Covid-19 pandemic. But financial results for 2024 released earlier this month brought that remarkable winning streak to a close. Takings all but flatlined in 2024, rising by less than 1% to £357m.</p> <p>Net revenues, which take into account the duty sliced off the top of a pint and sent to the Treasury, actually fell slightly. The company is taking on more debt, at sky-high interest rates, from TSG.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/YLlZe/3/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/YLlZe/3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>James Taylor, the second chief executive since Watt announced his departure 18 months ago – and the third James in a row to run the business – pointed investors towards his preferred “adjusted” operating profit measure.</p> <p>At that level, BrewDog returned to the black, but only to the tune of £7.5m. Pre-tax losses over the past two years amount to nearly £100m.</p> <p>So far, 2025 has offered little solace. BrewDog’s products, including its flagship Punk IPA, have been axed from 2,000 pubs as customers opted for rival beers. Last month, the brewer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/brewdog-to-close-10-bars-amid-extremely-difficult-time-for-hospitality-industry\">said it would close 10 of its own UK bars</a>, including on its home turf in Aberdeen.</p> <p>Some of this is down to environmental factors. The sluggish economy has constrained consumer spending across hospitality, while gen Z, a cohort who might have been expected to drink BrewDog 10 years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/28/i-know-my-limit-how-gen-z-became-britains-sober-curious-generation\">are now swerving alcoholic indulgence</a>.</p> <p>BrewDog says reports of its decline are exaggerated. Jettisoning loss-making bars will reduce costs, it argues, trimming a division that had over-expanded.</p> <p>The company also plays down the impact of being elbowed off the beer pumps at so many pubs. They point to new distribution deals with big venues, including West Ham United’s London Stadium, the Isle of Wight festival and that lodestar of punk culture, Lord’s cricket ground.</p> <p>These, say a spokesperson, have delivered more than three times the volume of sales lost from pubs.</p> <p>But the notion of peak BrewDog is about much more than the financials. It is, say observers, the inevitable culmination of years of behaviour that have gradually chipped away at BrewDog’s rebel image until there was almost nobody left who believed in it.</p> <h2>From brash to cringe</h2> <p>Everything seems right with the world when you’re <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkMbDEtHB0A\">throwing stuffed toy cats out of a helicopter</a>.</p> <p>The 2015 stunt – intended to mock “fat cat” beer companies – was just one of many thought up by Watt and his fellow co-founder Martin Dickie, who followed his partner out of the exit door earlier this year.</p>    <p>Their brash marketing strategy elicited the odd eye-roll, but on occasion, the duo badly misread the room.</p> <p>That same year, to send up their crowdfunding efforts, the pair filmed themselves begging and posing as sex workers. Thousands signed a petition calling the caricatures offensive.</p> <p>Their Pink IPA – a mock “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/brewdog-pink-beer-for-girls-punk-ipa\">beer for girls</a>” released on International Women’s Day 2018 and supposedly intended to challenge stereotypes – didn’t get many laughs from women in beer.</p> <p>By and large though, drinkers loved this brand of devilment, while those in the industry recognised that a rising tide lifted all boats and that in the early days at least, BrewDog was making good beers.</p> <p>“I was gushing about what they were doing,” says Curtis. “They were bringing the impetus from that US beer scene into the UK, which is what it needed.”</p> <p>He credits BrewDog with fostering talented people who went on to run breweries themselves, echoing the old line that everyone who bought the first Velvet Underground record went on to start a band.</p> <p>Brown points out that BrewDog has been a victim of revisionism too, from people who like to pretend they were always too cool for it. “They’ll say the beers were always shit. No they weren’t. They are now but they weren’t back then.”</p> <p>But the publicity missteps – not to mention the dissonance caused by the company’s corporatisation – became less trivial.</p>    <p>In 2017, BrewDog attracted criticism for threatening two small bars with legal action, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/27/brewdog-backs-down-lone-wolf-pub-trademark-dispute\">one for using the name Lone Wolf</a> – the same as a spirit brand that BrewDog was trying to launch, and another – against a Leeds pub – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/brewdog-lawsuit-bar-punk-brewer-pub\">for calling itself Draft Punk</a>.</p> <p>The irony of trying to copyright punk was not lost on beer fans.</p> <p>Then came the 2017 private equity investment and, in 2021 the bombshell Punks with Purpose open letter.</p> <p>In response to mounting criticism, Watt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/11/brewdog-co-founder-apologises-to-ex-staff-over-toxic-working-environment\">acknowledged some of his failings and apologised</a>. But he reacted with fury to a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0013yfj\">BBC documentary</a> that raised further questions about his behaviour. The Guardian revealed that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/brewdog-boss-accused-of-trying-to-intimidate-ex-staff-over-tv-expose\">hired private investigators to gather information on people</a> who had spoken to the BBC.</p> <p>One seemingly minor but telling detail that emerged was that Watt, such a vocal critic of Big Beer, even owned shares in the Dutch brewing giant Heineken.</p> <h2>Dog days are over?</h2> <p>Last year, the company faced a new staff backlash after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/10/brewdog-faces-staff-backlash-after-dropping-real-living-wage-pledge\">dropping its commitment to the real living wage</a> and then over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/brewdog-sacks-asian-woman-over-reaction-to-edl-members-meeting-in-bar\">handling of a decision by the EDL</a>, a far-right group, to use its Waterloo bar as a meeting point for a rally.</p> <p>More recently, Watt has courted ridicule for social media posts, including videos filmed alongside his former reality TV star partner Georgia Toffolo, in which he has railed against taxation on business and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/17/for-richer-or-poorer-brewdog-co-founder-may-delay-marriage-to-max-out-tax-relief\">mooted delaying the duo’s wedding to avoid a potential tax hit</a>.</p> <p>“People have looked at how he behaves, looked at the brand and thought they’d rather drink something else,” says Cole. “BrewDog has just totally lost its identity. Whether it was all just smoke and mirrors is kind of irrelevant.”</p> <p>One cohort that BrewDog has always been able fall back on was its army of shareholders, the “equity punks” who have a financial, as well as an emotional stake in the company, after taking part in its early crowdfunding rounds.</p> <p>Even their loyalty may be tested.</p> <p>BrewDog has previously indicated that it is seeking to float on the stock market, with valuations of up to £2bn bandied about. Faltering progress since then appears to have made a valuation even half that size fanciful.</p> <p>Detailed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da2dc2e-8791-421a-bf60-0de83de6d961\">analysis by the Financial Times</a>, published earlier this year, concluded that weak profitability, with the terms of the investment by TSG may have rendered the equity punks’ stakes worthless.</p> <p>If that turns out to be true, then some may look from BrewDog to the faceless brewing giants that they once mocked and find it impossible to tell which is which.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Hakluyt – formerly run by Varun Chandra – has been advising utilities company as it tries to avoid renationalisation</p>",
    "content": "<p>A corporate intelligence company part-owned and formerly run by the prime minister’s business adviser has been paid more than £1m by Thames Water as the utilities firm tries to avoid renationalisation, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt, which was run by Varun Chandra until his appointment as Keir Starmer’s business adviser last July, has worked with Thames since 2023, providing political and strategic advice.</p> \n<p>That commercial relationship between Thames and Hakluyt has continued since Chandra joined No 10. He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.</p> \n<p>That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/varun-chandra-starmer-adviser-proving-vital-link-for-labour-in-us-trade-talks\">still owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluyt</a> and is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.</p> \n<p>In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.</p> \n<p>Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.</p> \n<p>The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.</p> \n<p>It was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.</p> \n<p>Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.</p> \n<p>The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/rachel-reeves-thames-water-creditors\">wrote to creditors of the company in July</a> to say a “market-based solution” was her preference.</p> \n<p>Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.</p> \n<p>Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.</p> \n<p>That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.</p> \n<p>A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/bidders-demand-thames-water-granted-immunity-over-environmental-crimes\">leniency from fines and penalties</a>. They have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/creditors-set-out-20bn-plan-to-save-thames-water\">delivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five years</a> than had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.</p> \n<p>Chandra is one of Starmer’s most influential advisers, and has spearheaded its attempts to ingratiate Labour with business and attract foreign capital to the UK.</p> \n<p>He accompanied Reeves on her visit to the World Economic Forum in January, and was in the Oval Office when Starmer met Donald Trump in February.</p> \n<p>Chandra has also been central to Labour’s more muscular attempts to burnish its business credentials. It is understood he was behind the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/chair-of-competition-watchdog-steps-down-after-labour-intervention\">oust the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, Marcus Bokkerink</a>, amid concerns the watchdog was holding back growth.</p> \n<p>The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in South Shields, Chandra helped Tony Blair set up his first advisory firm, before becoming Hakluyt’s managing partner in 2019. As of May he held Hakluyt shares worth about £7m<strong>.</strong> The company, which was founded in 1995, was named after the Elizabethan writer, priest and diplomat Richard Hakluyt.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt has reportedly said it plans to buy back Chandra’s shares over time and that he no longer has any voting rights or decision-making roles within the company.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the company said: “Hakluyt is a global strategic advisory firm providing insight and advice to commercial clients on a range of issues. We are not a lobbying organisation and do not lobby governments on behalf of clients.”</p> \n<p>A Thames spokesperson said: “We remain focused on a market-led solution which we believe is in the best interest of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy.”</p> \n<p>A No 10 spokesperson said: “The Cabinet Office has a thorough process on declarations of interest for special advisers to ensure any conflicts of interest are properly managed and mitigated, including through recusals where appropriate.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>A man has been arrested after a Sikh woman said she had been left “deeply affected” by what police are treating as a racially motivated rape in the West Midlands.</p> <p>The woman, described as a British-born Sikh in her 20s, told police a racist remark was made to her during the assault in the Tame Road area of Oldbury on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>The perpetrators allegedly told her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out,” as they attacked her between 8am and 8.30am, according to the Sikh Federation (UK).</p> <p>West Midlands police said on Sunday evening that a man in his 30s had been detained as part of inquiries into the assault. He remains in custody on suspicion of rape. The woman is continuing to receive support as the investigation continues.</p> <p>In a statement released through the Sikh Federation, the victim expressed her gratitude to her community. “I want to sincerely thank everyone for supporting me and my family during this very difficult time,” she said. “We are going through a lot, but the strength and kindness shown by the right people in the community has been incredible, and I can’t thank them enough for being my voice.</p> <p>“I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us. Through it all, my family has been my rock, and my community has stood strong beside me.</p> <p>“The police are doing their best to find those responsible and I truly hope they are caught so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”</p> <p>Ch Supt Kim Madill, of West Midlands police, described the arrest as a “significant development in the investigation”. She said: “We want to thank the community for their continuing support. The investigation remains ongoing and we would urge people not to speculate as we work to identify and trace all those who may have been involved.”</p> <p>Police previously said they were looking for two white men in connection with the attack. The first was described as having a shaved head and a heavy build, wearing a dark sweatshirt with gloves. The second was said to be wearing a grey top with a silver zip.</p> <p>Local MPs expressed their shock after initial reports of the attack. Sarah Coombes, Labour’s MP for West Bromwich, which includes Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.</p> <p>Gurinder Singh Josan, the Labour MP for Smethwick, previously said the “truly horrific attack” was being treated as a hate crime, while Preet Kaur Gill, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said she had been contacted by concerned constituents. She said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Met police say further arrests expected after 24 were detained during ‘Unite the Kingdom’ march in London</p>",
    "content": "<p>Police are searching for a man who called for Keir Starmer to be killed during Saturday’s “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London, with further arrests expected in the coming days after outbreaks of violence.</p> <p>Scotland Yard estimated that between 110,000 and 150,000 people attended the far-right event, organised by the activist known as Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>A total of 26 police officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled, and the Metropolitan police said on Sunday that 24 people had been arrested for a range of alleged offences including common assault and violent disorder.</p> <p>The force said a post-event investigation was under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.</p> <p>The oldest person arrested was 58, the youngest 19, and the average age of those arrested was 39. Three of those arrested at the protest were women.</p> <p>A man who said on camera that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated” and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”, and whose comments were published online, is among those being sought by police.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: “We’re aware of a video circulating on social media from the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest on Saturday. Officers are investigating and enquiries are ongoing to identify a man.”</p> <p>Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was among those who addressed the crowds from a stage, along with a range of other far-right figures. However, there were no-shows by promised speakers including Steve Bannon, a former strategist for Donald Trump, and Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and author.</p> <p>Speakers included the owner of X, Elon Musk, who claimed a “dissolution of parliament” was needed and said “massive uncontrolled migration” was contributing to the “destruction of Britain”, in comments made via video link.</p> <p>Others who appeared on the same stage included the former Reform UK deputy leader Ben Habib, who is setting up a rival party to the right of Reform known as Advance UK, which Robinson says he has joined. European far-right figures including the former French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour and Danish and German parliamentarians also took part.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate described it as Britain’s largest-ever far-right protest. Joe Mulhall, the counter-extremism campaign group’s director of research, said it was concerning that such a big crowd had come together to cheer speakers who called for the banning of all public expression of non-Christian religions, demanded the “remigration” of legal migrants, pushed Covid conspiracy theories, and claimed Britain was being “invaded” and its population “replaced”.</p> <p>“This was unprecedented,” he said. “The messages that were coming from the stage and radicalisation of that crowd are a step change even from the days of the English Defence League.</p> <p>“The EDL might have been more violent but what we are now seeing is something that has broadened out from a street movement into a much wider attack on everything from multiculturalism to LGBT rights.</p> <p>“The language from the speakers and the reception from the crowd were for positions that we might have regarded as being on the ‘extreme’ of the far right in the past, but it’s worrying now that it’s becoming almost normalised,” Mulhall added. “We’re also even seeing in some sections of the media a pushback against the fact that this was a far-right rally.”</p> <p>The rally was opposed by a smaller counter-protest organised by Stand Up to Racism, which estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 had taken part. Organisers said some of them were assaulted and were hit by projectiles.</p> <p>At one point the counter-demonstration was broken into two parts while Robinson supporters who had blocked the opposing protesters from leaving Whitehall had to be moved by police.</p> <p>Robinson’s next moves are unclear, although there is potential for a political route via his association with Advance UK, which would be eager to capitalise on the bloc of support Robinson is able to mobilise and that could eat into Reform UK’s support.</p> <p>However, his past forays into politics have not been successful. Robinson, who was a member of the British National party in the past, won only 2.2% of the vote and lost his £5,000 deposit when he stood in north-west England in elections for the European parliament in 2019.</p> <p>He has already indicated that he plans to organise another big rally in future but has not given further details. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Gurpreet Singh Johal wants to know if stops are linked to his efforts to find out whether UK intelligence played a role in sibling’s arrest</p>",
    "content": "<p>The brother of Jagtar Singh Johal, a British Sikh jailed in India, has written to the Home Office to ask why he is being repeatedly stopped at the airport by British border police.</p> <p>Gurpreet Singh Johal, a Labour councillor in Dumbarton, asked if it was linked to his legal efforts to discover whether British intelligence played a role in his brother’s arrest eight years ago.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “I have been repeatedly stopped at the British border, and no explanation is being given. I don’t know if this is an attempt by someone to intimidate me, but I am not going to stop seeking redress for my brother who has been in jail since 2017 without full trial.”</p> <p>A UK court hearing is due in a few weeks’ time in which Jagtar’s lawyers, including from the legal organisation Reprieve, will seek to discover if he was arrested in India in 2017 after a tipoff by British intelligence. Much of the UK hearing is likely to be held in closed session.</p> <p>Jagtar has not been found guilty in any Indian court, and a series of delays caused by the Indian prosecutor’s inability to assemble credible witnesses mean he has been detained without full trial.</p> <p>Charges against him at state level in Punjab were dismissed by the court in March 2025 as no evidence or witnesses were produced. The largely identical federal-level charges being brought by India’s National Investigation Agency remain.</p> <p>Gurpreet says he has been stopped four times in the last two years when he has returned to the UK from holiday. Neither the Home Office nor Police Scotland have given him explanations that justify him being taken aside in front of his family. He was stopped at Heathrow in November 2023 and twice at Glasgow airport in April and July 2024 and once in July 2025. Each time he was told at the e-gates to “seek assistance” that then led to a set of inquiries.<br><br>After years of delay, Gurpreet’s rare legal tort claim against the British intelligence services is due to reach the court on 6 October. The closed proceedings, made necessary by the involvement of the British intelligence services, mean Jagtar’s own lawyers cannot be present, but parts of the first hearing will be open to media and the public.</p>    <p>Jagtar’s legal team is arguing that a member of the British intelligence services appears to be the individual described anonymously in the 2020 annual report by the UK’s Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO),<sup> </sup>which sets out how MI5 and MI6 passed information to foreign authorities about a British national who was then detained and tortured.</p> <p>The report said the case had been raised by the then UK prime minister with Indian authorities. Theresa May is known to have raised Jagtar’s case in 2018 with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other circumstantial evidence suggests the case referred to is Jagtar’s.</p> <p>Jagtar’s British lawyers are asking the government to admit the individual was Jagtar, grant him redress for the harm he has suffered, to recognise that its actions were unlawful and publicly apologise for its role in his suffering.</p> <p>His lawyers claim he was severely tortured after he was arrested in Jalandhar, Punjab, three weeks after his wedding. At the time local media reported that a British Sikh had been arrested on the basis of a tipoff from British intelligence. The alleged torture led to a false confession, his lawyers say.</p> <p>British rules required ministerial consent for intelligence sharing to occur where there was a risk of torture. The foreign secretary at the time was Boris Johnson, and the court would probably hear if he authorised the sharing of the information with the Indian authorities.</p> <p>A second possible explanation for Gurpreet’s experience is that the British police have generally increased their targeting of British Sikhs, probably in the wake of pressure from the Indian government.</p> <p>Gurpreet said: “Being stopped this number of times, sometimes for long periods without proper explanation is concerning. I am being asked by my children at the airport what I have done wrong and I cannot tell them except I am campaigning to get my brother released from an Indian jail, or that this is straightforward discrimination. It will certainly not lead to me dropping the case against the British intelligence services.”</p> <p>The Home Office has refused an explanation for the stops, citing the Data Protection Act where complying with the right of access to the information on why he is being stopped “would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime”.</p> <p>In addition, the Home Office claims the border police have a right to stop individuals in the national interest. Police Scotland referred the issue to the Home Office and said there had been no request from Police Scotland for him to be stopped.</p> <p>A UN working group on arbitrary detention has determined that Jagtar’s detention “lacks [a] legal basis” and is based on “discriminatory grounds” owing to his Sikh faith and his “status as a human rights defender”, and that Jagtar was subjected to torture.</p> <p>Jagtar is accused of being a member of a terrorist group, the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), which has carried out attacks in the Punjab region.</p> <p>The charges against Jagtar state that he travelled to Paris in 2013 and delivered £3,000 to other KLF figures, with the money then used to purchase weapons employed in a series of murders and attacks against Hindu nationalist and other religious leaders in 2016 and 2017.</p>",

    "content": "<p>My friend Ken Brown, who has died aged 88, was a social anthropologist, sociologist and senior lecturer at Manchester University for two decades. </p> <p>He was born in Los Angeles to Rose (nee Glesby) and Samuel Brown, who ran a family clothes shop in Beverly Hills. They lived in West Hollywood, where Ken attended Hollywood high school. At 18 he went to Chicago University, graduating in history in 1957; soon after that he went to Jerusalem, where he met Josy Cohen, a librarian, who later became a social worker. They married in 1958.</p> <p>The couple moved to Los Angeles, where Ken embarked on a doctorate at UCLA. His research topic was the ancient city of Salé, near Rabat, so he and his young family spent two years in Morocco in the mid-1960s.</p> <p>After completing his studies Ken won a Fulbright scholarship to Manchester University, where in 1971 he became a lecturer in its social anthropology department, and then its sociology department. Manchester brought stability to the family, but Ken’s heart was in fieldwork and he undertook social anthropological research trips to Morocco, Tunisia, Jerusalem and Palestine. Although he was a senior lecturer in the sociology department, he became increasingly fed up with academic politics and in the late 80s he eagerly accepted an offer of early retirement.</p> <p>In 1991 he founded <a href=\"https://www.mmsh.fr/fait-maison/cinumed-cite-numerique-de-la-mediterranee/revue-mediterraneans-mediterraneennes-ideas-new-writing-images/\">Mediterraneans</a>, a book-format review that explored the cultures of countries around the Mediterranean. It made quite a stir in its first issue, with contributions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/14/juan-goytisolo-obituary\">Juan Goytisolo</a>, Lawrence Durrell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary\">John Berger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/11/jacques-berque-algeria-arab-culture-france\">Jacques Berque</a>, Yannis Ritsos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/11/poetry.israelandthepalestinians\">Mahmoud Darwish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/15/jean-mohr-obituary\">Jean Mohr</a>. </p> <p>For issue three Ken moved operations to Paris. where funding was more easily secured. He was the editor and director of publication throughout its run; he sometimes had to forgo his salary in order to publish the magazine or pay one of the employees. Right up until its final issue, No 15, in 2011, the publication depended on his remarkable ability to persuade people and institutions to support his concept.</p> <p>Malise Ruthven had noted in the Times Literary Supplement that “it would be a tragedy if the journal were to fold”. But fold it did, though much of it can today be found online.</p> <p>Josy died in 2020. Ken is survived by their children, Daniel, Yorick and Tamar, and seven grandchildren.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sainsbury’s hopes of offloading its retail business Argos to one of China’s biggest retailers have collapsed as talks ended on Sunday.</p> <p>The supermarket giant confirmed it was no longer in discussions with JD.com to sell Argos, the general merchandise arm it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">bought for more than £1bn</a> less than a decade ago.</p> <p>On Saturday it had announced talks with JD.com for a sale that it said would speed up the transformation of Argos, whose business has gone increasingly online and within larger Sainsbury’s branches.</p> <p>But 24 hours later, Sainsbury’s said the deal was off. It said: “JD.com has communicated that it would now only be prepared to engage on a materially revised set of terms and commitments which are not in the best interests of Sainsbury’s shareholders, colleagues and broader stakeholders. Accordingly, Sainsbury’s confirms that it has now terminated discussions with JD.com.”</p> <p>JD.com, which is unrelated to JD Sports, is one of China’s biggest retailers and also provides its supply chain-based technology and services across other sectors. Last year, JD.com walked away from a deal to buy the UK white goods and electronics retailer Curry’s.</p> <p>Argos is the UK’s second largest general merchandise retailer, behind Tesco, with the third most visited retail website in the UK, according to Sainsbury’s. It retains almost 200 standalone stores – with kiosks where customers used to peruse its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/30/argos-to-stop-printing-catalogue-after-almost-50-years\">famous catalogue</a> – and more than 1,100 collection points, mostly in Sainsbury’s stores.</p> <p>Before the collapse, Sainsbury’s had talked up the potential deal as accelerating its turnaround of Argos, saying: “JD.com would bring world-class retail, technology and logistics expertise and invest to drive Argos’s growth and further transform the customer experience.”</p> <p>A sale would almost certainly have commanded a far lower figure than the £1.1bn Sainsbury’s paid in 2016 for Home Retail, the then owner of Argos. Sainsbury’s latest accounts valued the chain at £344m, and the group said growth at the main supermarket business was weighed down by falling Argos profits.</p> <p>Some retail analysts have questioned the supermarket’s transplanting of the Argos operation into its stores. Hundreds of standalone Argos stores were closed as the business restructured and moved more to online shopping.</p> <p>In 2023, Sainsbury’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/sainsburys-to-close-two-argos-distribution-sites-risking-1400-jobs\">closed down two Argos distribution centres</a> and the business’s head office in Milton Keynes in a further attempt to cut costs.</p>",

It was too early to pick her daughter up, she thought. It was an ordinary decision, on an ordinary morning. But it is one that has haunted her ever since.</p> <p>Five minutes later, at 11.45am on Monday 29 July 2024, Axel Rudakubana walked into the Hart Space, hood up, and entered the first-floor studio. Many of the 26 young girls were gathered around a table making bracelets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/11/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-teenage-girl-stabbed\">Teenage girl stabbed twice in Southport attack relives day ‘like horror film on repeat’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first, they thought he was there to show off a puppy belonging to the instructor, Leanne Lucas. Then he grabbed a child. They thought it was a fake knife, fake blood. Running and screaming, one girl thought they were playing hide and seek.</p> <p>Their innocence was shattered in seconds. In just 12 minutes, the 17-year-old carried out the most barbaric knife attack on British children in modern times. He inflicted hundreds of injuries that are too distressing to recount.</p> <p>For the first time, families of 22 of the girls present that day have spoken about its horrifying impact in emotional testimony to a public inquiry at Liverpool town hall.</p> <p>Over five days of harrowing testimony, the inquiry heard how many of those stabbed only survived due to the expert care of police, paramedics, strangers and surgeons. But the psychological scars run searingly deep.</p> <p>They suffer nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks. They are unable to sleep alone, triggered by blood, screams, sirens – even open doorways like the one Rudakubana walked through.</p> <p>The parents of the three young girls who were murdered – six-year-old Bebe King; Elsie Dot Stancombe, aged seven; and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine – will appear before the inquiry on Monday.</p> <p>The hearings will then examine how such a troubled teenager with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/20/axel-rudakubana-a-ticking-timebomb-who-murdered-three-girls-in-southport\">well-known obsession</a> with knives and extreme violence – who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/25/axel-rudakubana-from-unassuming-schoolboy-to-notorious-southport-killer\">referred three times</a> to the counter-radicalisation scheme Prevent – was able to carry out what the inquiry chair, Sir Adrian Fulford, called “one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history”.</p> <p>Fulford, a retired senior judge, has signalled that he will make far-reaching recommendations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/08/southport-inquiry-to-examine-wholesale-failure-to-prevent-attack\">when he reports to the government</a> in the coming months. These are expected to include a consideration of new powers to restrict the liberty of people when there is strong evidence they intend to carry out an attack but not enough to justify an arrest.</p> <p>In the wake of the attack, ministers said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/20/yvette-cooper-to-create-new-offence-to-cover-non-terrorist-planning-of-attacks\">they plan to “close the gap” in legislation</a> so police can arrest those suspected of planning an attack but who, like Rudakubana, have no fixed ideology.</p> <p>Fulford has accepted that such restrictions may run counter to the “basic underpinnings of our democracy and civil liberties” but that the gravity of the attack – and what he described as the “wholesale and general failure” of authorities – could justify such measures.</p> <p>More than a year later, some of the girls and their parents remain too traumatised to speak about what happened. One was only able to discuss it with her counsellor in July, a year on.</p> <p>The mother of one little girl, who can only be identified as Child O, said that day “marked the end of her carefree childhood”.</p> <p>A bright, confident, joyous girl had been turned into a nervous wreck. Though physically unharmed, she is unable to be left alone, startled by noise, fearing that the killer was “coming to find her, to finish what he started”.</p> <p>“The flashbacks and intrusive thoughts were unbearable,” her mother said. To cope, the little girl sat from dawn until dusk making bracelets, keeping her mind busy.</p> <p>“Her little fingers working tirelessly because stopping meant the memories flooded back. If she paused, she broke down. That was the only way she could survive the days in the beginning.”</p> <p>Special occasions bring extra worry, particularly Halloween and Christmas. Many can no longer attend birthday parties due to the noise and chaos. “On Christmas Eve, she could not be alone in her bedroom,” said one mother of her young daughter. “The idea of Father Christmas, a man she does not know, entering our house filled her with fear instead of excitement.”</p> <p>The inquiry also heard accounts of heroism. One gravely injured girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/girl-saved-sisters-life-by-shielding-her-from-southport-attacker-inquiry-hears\">shielded her younger sister from the killer’s blows</a>, allowing her to escape. Others helped the smaller children to run, placing their hands on the railing of the stairwell, no doubt saving their lives.</p> <p>Heidi Liddle, a dance instructor who helped lead the event, spoke for the first time about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-dance-teachers\">“crushing” guilt</a> and feeling “responsible” for what happened. Liddle had saved one girl by locking them both inside a toilet as Rudakubana tried to get in. But she had avoided contacting the families, she said, because she worried she would not be welcome.</p> <p>The day after Liddle gave evidence, the mother of that little girl said the class leader had saved her daughter’s life: “I owe everything to Heidi for having the foresight to protect my daughter.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/man-stabbed-tackling-southport-killer-scene-horror-jonathan-hayes\">Man stabbed while tackling Southport killer describes scene of ‘horror’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From next week the inquiry will hear evidence from MI5, counter-terror police, social services, officials from as many as six government departments, and Amazon, where Rudakubana purchased the 20cm (8in) knife days earlier, despite being underage. The killer’s older brother, Dion, may also testify.</p> <p>Of all the searching questions raised by this catastrophe, they must answer the biggest one of all: “Why wasn’t he stopped?” It was a question put to the inquiry by a teenage girl who was photographing the event when she was stabbed twice.</p> <p>“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again,” she said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 28-year-old man has admitted to starting a fire that destroyed the constituency office of Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>Joshua Oliver, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to arson, with the resulting fire wrecking the Washington and Gateshead South MP’s office in the early hours of Thursday.</p> <p>The guilty plea was entered at Newcastle magistrates court on the basis that it was reckless rather than intentional. The crown did not accept the basis of the plea.</p> <p>The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases called Niemann-Pick UK (NPUK). An NHS mental health service for veterans was based in the same building.</p> <p>Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Oliver had been living in a tent nearby, the court heard. District judge Kate Meek remanded him in custody to appear at Newcastle crown court on 14 October.</p> <p>Oliver was charged with arson of Vermont House, Washington, with the damage estimated at between £250,000 to £500,000, and he admitted starting a fire in a wheelie bin that then spread.</p> <p>Heather Bolton, defending, said: “He accepts he has set fire to the wheelie bin, he didn’t intend for the fire to spread to the building.”</p> <p>The defendant was told a decision will be made whether a Newton hearing, which would rule whether the offence was intentional or not, will be necessary.</p> <p>Oliver also admitted burgling the building when he stole a mallet and power tools on the night. He admitted three counts of criminal damage, namely smashing windows at Vermont House, in the days before the fire.</p> <p>The defendant also admitted twice smashing windows at his father’s house in Sunderland in July.</p> <p>The district judge said he will be sentenced for all offences at the crown court.</p>",

It still contains an ornate fireplace that the poet gifted to the then owners.</p> <p>In November last year, DePree said, Rochdale council “suddenly locked the gates to the hall without any warning whatsoever”, with the local authority saying the American had not upheld his part of the deal.</p> <p>“It was a big shock and really devastating,” he said, “because so many of our volunteers from the community have been putting in five years rescuing the gardens that were completely in rack and ruin, and they turned them around into award-winning gardens.”</p> <p>DePree said he had “no confidence” in the council to secure the future of the building, and wanted to be allowed to carry on with the restoration project he had been spearheading for the best part of a decade.</p> <p>The actor said it was “really upsetting” to be told he had not made enough progress on the project, adding: “It’s been years and years of my life.”</p> <p>“I sold my house to help enable everything moving forward, and I left everything behind,” he said. “At this point, it’s been over 10 years that I’ve been involved, and I moved to England in 2017.</p> <p>“I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of my own personal money to make this happen.</p> <p>“I’m completely invested in it, and also I believe in the community,” he added. “I know how much hard work that we put in that at this point, this building has to be saved.”</p> <p>DePree said he has spent almost 11 months “trying to work with Rochdale council to find a resolution”, but now felt he had been “left with no choice but to sue Rochdale council in the high court” in order “to force them to honour our agreement”.</p>    <p>DePree’s lawyer, Nick Wells, said: “We have reviewed many years of documents and emails and eventually obtained some previously unseen evidence through freedom of information and subject access requests, many of which Rochdale borough council tried to block.” </p> <p>Wells said “the evidence points to the council having changed its position since entering into the option agreement in 2017”.</p> <p>“We are therefore asking the high court to intervene and hold Rochdale council to the decisions that they made in 2017,” he added, “rather than the decisions they have purported to have made in 2024.”</p> <p>In a previous life, Michigan-born DePree was an actor, film-maker, and writer, who once won a deal with Warner Bros to produce and star in his own television show.</p> <p>He grew up listening to stories of the family’s ancestral home in England, but believed them to be fairytales, until he began researching his family tree online, and discovered his Manchester roots.</p> <p>“I’ve given up my life for this building,” he said. “I came over to visit it first in 2013, just to see it. My grandfather was also named Hopwood, so he told me stories about it.</p> <p>“I felt that if I didn’t do something that it would fall into being lost forever,” he added. “So I gave up my life. I moved over from the US to the UK. I completely trusted the council at the time; I thought we were working in partnership together.”</p>    <p>Rochdale council said it does not comment on continuing legal proceedings, but pointed to previous statements it had made about the hall.</p> <p>A spokesperson said in November: “In 2017, the council entered into an options agreement with Hopwood DePree which gave him the option to buy the building for a nominal fee if he could produce a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall, alongside a detailed planning permission.</p> <p>“Although this agreement has been renewed a number of times since 2017, a viable business case and funding strategy has not been forthcoming, and so the council’s cabinet has made the decision to not renew the options agreement.”</p> <p>“The council sees Hopwood Hall as a very important part of Middleton’s heritage,” the spokesperson said, adding that alongside other public bodies such as Historic England, it had invested almost £1.7m into the building over the past seven years.</p> <p>The council said it had “commissioned independent financial consultants to assess the business model proposed by Hopwood Productions and they concluded that these proposals would be loss-making and unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding”.</p> <p>“As Hopwood Depree has not been able to produce a viable proposal, despite having had seven years to do so,” the council said that in order to protect public money invested in the building it had “a responsibility to explore alternative options”.</p> <p>“The council remains committed to the long-term future of the hall,” the spokesperson added, “and is keen to see it restored, so it can be brought into a viable future use.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Signs tout a natural paradise, but pollution from over-farming has left Northern Ireland’s Lough Neagh choked by toxic algae</p>",
    "content": "<p>The bright, cheery signs dot the shoreline like epistles from another era, a time before the calamity.</p> <p>“Ballyronan marina is a picturesque boating and tourist facility on the shores of Lough Neagh,” says one. “Contours of its historical past embrace the virginal shoreline.”</p> <p>Another sign boasts that the “rich ecological diversity and abundance of salmon and eels” has sustained communities there for thousands of years, since the stone age.</p> <p>A roadside billboard declares the Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Cooperative Society to be Europe’s biggest producer of wild eels. Yet another sign tells visitors that this majestic landscape of water and sky inspired Seamus Heaney’s Nobel-winning poetry.</p>    <p>Beauty, ecology, heritage, tourism, fishing – the UK’s biggest lake, sitting in the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, had bragging rights to fill a hundred signs. But now they line the shoreline as testaments to hubris because of an environmental disaster.</p> <p>The 400 sq km (150 sq mile) freshwater lough is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/19/like-the-flip-of-a-switch-its-gone-has-the-ecosystem-of-the-uk-largest-lake-collapsed-aoe\">choking on recurring toxic algal blooms</a> that coat the surface, kill wildlife, unleash stenches and make the lake all but unusable. Eel fishing has been suspended and tourists have fled.</p> <p>The lough and surrounding watercourses are on course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/30/uk-largest-lake-lough-neagh-faces-environmental-crisis-as-rescue-plans-stall\">record their worst year</a>, with at least 171 detections of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) growths, according to a<a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c2a28780d7554bed9d1f47f3ae710fa4/page/bluegreenalgaemap#data_s=id%3AdataSource_3-19174534d65-layer-3%3A3908\"> government pollution tracker</a>. The algae’s return was a “distressing but timely reminder of the need to urgently turn the tide on the ecological crisis”, Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The main cause is an overload of phosphorus and nitrogen from agriculture, including farm runoff, fertilisers and animal waste. Inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and septic tank leakage aggravate the problems. Additional factors are sand extraction, warming water and proliferating zebra mussels, an invasive species.</p> <p>The Stormont executive agreed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/22/pollution-plan-must-cut-intensive-farming-for-lough-neagh-to-survive\">rescue plan last year</a> but has balked at reining in polluters, prompting condemnation from Claire Hanna, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party: “Lough Neagh is dying in front of our eyes. Images of fish and eels gasping for life on the surface are not just shocking – they are a stark warning of total ecological collapse.”</p> <p>This week an activist, Bea Shrewsbury, attempted to present a “Lough Neagh smoothie”, drawn from the lake, to assembly members at Stormont. Police escorted her away.</p> <p>The lough supplies 40% of Northern Ireland’s drinking water, which is treated and said to be safe. Not everyone is convinced. “I’ve not drunk from the tap in a year,” said Brigid Laverty, 67, who lives by the lake. This week the Food Standards Agency said toxins have been found in the flesh of some fish for the first time but that commercially harvested fish remained safe to eat.</p>    <p>The water should be light brown but has turned green, said Peter Harper, an environmental officer with the <a href=\"https://loughneaghpartnership.org/\">Lough Neagh Partnership</a>, a nonprofit group. In some places the sludge – so widespread it is <a href=\"https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/?zoom=11&amp;lat=54.61781&amp;lng=-6.27286&amp;themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&amp;visualizationUrl=U2FsdGVkX1%2BoH4aEyDaWug7G8pS03N929e5oUXTIjwOiCd8gp%2Bxzse%2FG8gRwy6jpJ3F59S1CcxNmbNkreJmjeE16e8EFvmNYsmOTxmIMM%2B2sAUe%2BG%2Fol9wSvOkMxVb5%2B&amp;datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS&amp;fromTime=2025-08-17T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;toTime=2025-08-17T23%3A59%3A59.999Z&amp;layerId=1_TRUE_COLOR&amp;demSource3D=%22MAPZEN%22&amp;cloudCoverage=30&amp;dateMode=SINGLE\">visible from space</a> – forms mosaic-type patterns and swirls redolent of Gustav Klimt, said Harper. “It can be weirdly beautiful.”</p> <p>The impact on wildlife is incalculable, making the tourism-themed shoreline signs a grim joke. “What lies beneath?” says one. “A world of ancient history and astounding myths is waiting just below the surface. What unique creatures have made the lough their home?”</p> <p>Another sign exhorts visitors: “This special place deserves respect … please keep dogs on leads.” It urges swimmers to be careful because conditions can change fast. But there are no swimmers, and virtually no boats, because there is no demand and algae clogs engines.</p>    <p>A more recent sign, tacked to a lamp-post at Ballyronan marina, is more up to date: “Spotted a dead wild bird? Use the DAERA dead wild bird reporting tool service if you find dead gulls, waders, ducks or swans.”</p> <p>DAERA is the department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs – a bureaucracy that critics say prioritised the farms and agrifood companies that expanded pig, chicken and cattle numbers in the past decade and overloaded the soil’s ability to absorb nutrients. They did so with official blessing in a “going for growth” strategy.</p> <p>“It was not thought through,” said Gerry Darby, the manager of the Lough Neagh Partnership. “I’ll put it another way. The guy who did the calculations about nutrient levels knew fuck all about fuck all.”</p>    <p>Muir, of the Alliance party, said his department had completed or made good progress on most of the 37 points in an action plan agreed last year, but said Stormont faced “difficult decisions” over key measures. Sinn Féin and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dup\">Democratic Unionist party</a>, who dominate the executive, appear to have stalled the nutrients action programme over fears of a farmer backlash.</p> <p>Darby said there was no magical solution, only trade-offs, but still expressed confidence that politicians would take the necessary measures. “The lake is not dead,” he said. “It could be dead if things continue as they are.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>An immigration law firm that signed up thousands of asylum seekers and generated income of £1.7m in legal aid in the last year, despite only employing five solicitors to represent them, has had its government contract terminated after concerns about its performance, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The decision leaves many asylum seekers struggling to find new legal representatives at a time when the government is increasing the number of cases it refuses.</p> <p>In the year ending June 2025 initial asylum grants fell from 58% to 48%, leaving more people having to lodge appeals, something that is difficult to do without a legal representative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/starmer-hope-not-hate-letter-racism-far-right\">Starmer urged to do more to push back against ‘onslaught of racism’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Middlesex Law Chambers’ legal aid income for immigration work dramatically increased from £43,000 in 2021 to £1.7m in 2025. The firm is <a href=\"https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/register/organisation/?sraNumber=8008175&amp;prevSearchText=Middlesex%20Law%20Chambers&amp;prevSearchFilter=\">listed</a> on the Solicitors Regulation Authority website as having 15 offices around the country, many in legal aid deserts such as Peterborough, Plymouth and Crawley.</p> <p>When the Guardian phoned these offices there was either no reply or a receptionist for the office block where the firm rented a space said it was no longer there.</p> <p>The director of Middlesex Law Chambers, criminal defence solicitor Sheraz Chowdhry, said the firm had planned to expand into those areas but in most cases had not done so and had now terminated rental arrangements for those office spaces.</p> <p>It currently has one solicitor employed at its Southall office doing private immigration work, one solicitor at an office in Canary Wharf in east London doing family work and a small team at its Uxbridge office doing criminal defence work. Legal aid contracts continue for those areas of work.</p> <p>Chowdhry joined the firm at the end of last year just months before the previous lawyer in charge of immigration work, Hina Choudhery, died from complications of cancer.</p> <p>He said: “Ultimately the firm, obstructed by Hina’s poor health over the last two years or so, has found it difficult to maintain its once very high standards in the immigration department.”</p> <p>He added he found out about the termination of the legal aid contract for immigration work just weeks ago. “The decision was also only communicated to us via email on 20 August 2025.”</p> <p>When asked to explain why the firm had expanded its caseload so dramatically and how it was possible to provide adequate legal representation for thousands of asylum seekers with just five immigration solicitors and a mix of 15 junior and more senior caseworkers, he said: “No solicitor was here during the expansion phase. It is difficult for me to explain how the firm suddenly grew so large in such a short space of time. I do not know.”</p> <p>A typical caseload for a legally aided asylum solicitor or caseworker is 15–20. With the number of staff employed by the firm during its period of rapid expansion each solicitor and caseworker would have had about 164 cases.</p> <p>Frances Timberlake, of Migrants Organise, which has many migrant members who complained about the service provided by the firm, said: “It is the Ministry of Justice’s duty to ensure that legal advice is available to people who need it. But decades of funding cuts and neglect to the legal aid system have left many people in our communities without any support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/03/legal-aid-cyber-attack-has-pushed-sector-towards-collapse-say-lawyers\">Legal aid cyber-attack has pushed sector towards collapse, say lawyers </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We urgently need funding for good legal advice and for the government to stop pushing migrants into hostile, expensive legal processes just as a charade for Reform,” she said.</p> <p>Dr Jo Wilding, a researcher and senior lecturer in legal aid at the University of Sussex and an immigration barrister, said: ‘This was completely foreseeable when one small firm with very few accredited staff set up offices in several new areas, including six serious advice desert areas, and started taking on hundreds of cases.</p> <p>“It should have been obvious that vulnerable people were being exploited but the Legal Aid Agency doesn’t seem to have identified or recognised that there was a problem. The solution to this is to stop treating legal aid for the most vulnerable people as if it was a market, and to pay that money to a reputable expert law firm or not-for-profit to do the work.”</p> <p>Rami, a former client of Middlesex Law Chambers, said: “It’s good that the government has stepped in and closed this firm. But it feels too late, because a lot of people like me have already suffered because of the work of this firm. I had to do my asylum interview without any real advice beforehand, holding my evidence in my hand that I had translated on Google because the law firm had not done it. I have lost a lot of time in my life because of this. I have grey hair now when before this I did not.</p> <p>“People seeking asylum face a lot of problems and a lawyer can help us to get through bad situations. But it is very difficult to find a legal aid lawyer and many people don’t speak English so cannot know which is a good law firm and which is not.”</p> <p>A Legal Aid Agency spokesperson said: “Middlesex Law Chambers’ immigration legal aid contract has been terminated.</p> <p>“Firms that hold legal aid contracts are subject to annual reviews. These can lead to financial sanctions or, as in this case, contract termination where standards are not met.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Elon Musk has called for a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government” in the UK while addressing a crowd attending a “unite the kingdom” rally in London, organised by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">Police assaulted as far-right rally led by Tommy Robinson sparks clashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Musk, the owner of X, who dialled in via a video link and spoke to Robinson while thousands watched and listened, also railed against the “woke mind virus” and told the crowd that “violence is coming” and that “you either fight back or you die”.</p> \n<p>He said: “I really think that there’s got to be a change of government in Britain. You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long.</p> \n<p>“Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.” </p> \n<p>This is not the first time Musk has involved himself in British politics. He started a war of words with the UK government over grooming gangs and also criticised 2023’s Online Safety Act, calling the legislation a threat to free speech.</p> \n<p>He had a warm relationship with Nigel Farage, and there were even rumours he could channel a donation to his party before the Tesla boss called for the Reform UK leader to be replaced during a dispute over his support for Robinson.</p> \n<p>Musk told the crowd in central London: “My appeal is to British common sense, which is to look carefully around you and say: ‘If this continues, what world will you be living in?’</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69ef6a8b-ea31-4229-a361-f5cce4c7db80\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q0HHZbvvQOE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business.</p> \n<p>“My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here.</p> \n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> \n<p>Musk also told the crowd “the left are the party of murder”, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">death of Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> \n<p>He said: “There’s so much violence on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week and people on the left celebrating it openly. The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. I mean, let that sink in for a minute, that’s who we’re dealing with here.”</p> \n<p>He also criticised what he called the woke mind virus and said decisions for advancement should be on merit rather than “discrimination on the basis of sex, or religion or any race or anything else”.</p> \n<p>He said: “A lot of the woke stuff is actually super-racist, it’s super-sexist and often it’s anti-religion, but only anti-Christian, like why anti-Christian? That’s unfair … that should be all that matters, the woke mind virus, that I call it, is against all that.”</p> \n<p>More than 110,000 people were estimated to have taken part in the far-right street rally, in what is thought to be one of the largest nationalist events in decades. The marchers were faced by about 5,000 anti-racist counter-protesters.</p> \n<p>In addition to Musk, figures including Katie Hopkins and French far-right politician Éric Zemmour were invited to speak at the event.</p> \n<p><em>PA Media contributed to this report</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>West Midlands detectives are looking for two white male suspects after incident involving 20-year-old in Oldbury</p>",
    "content": "<p>MPs have expressed their shock at reports of the racially motivated rape of a 20-year-old Sikh woman, said to have occurred in broad daylight.</p> <p>Detectives are looking for two white male suspects alleged to have racially abused the woman during the assault – they believe one suspect had a shaved head and wore gloves.</p> <p>The incident is alleged to have taken place on Tuesday morning in Oldbury, close to Birmingham. A Sikh community group said it had spoken to the woman and her family and that the words the attackers said were: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.” </p> <p>Police confirmed it was being treated as a racially aggravated attack and isolated incident.</p> <p>The attack took place off Tame Road, a short distance from the constituency office of Gurinder Singh Josan, MP for Smethwick.</p> <p>The MP said: “I understand the strength of feeling within the community this attack has generated. The community needs to allow the police to progress with the investigation.”</p> <p>Sarah Coombes, MP for West Bromwich including Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.</p> <p>MP for Birmingham Edgbaston Preet Kaur Gill said she was deeply shocked by the attack and that constituents had been contacting her to express their fear.</p> <p>Gill said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected, and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.</p> <p>“The rise in overt racism recently is deeply concerning, and I will be working with West Midlands police to ensure everything is being done to catch those responsible and to keep our community safe.”</p> <p>Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South, said he knew of people who had become scared for their safety due to an increase in “racist rhetoric” in the UK over the summer,</p> <p>He said: “Let’s be clear, this attack is a result of the rising racial tensions in our country and now, a young woman has been left traumatised for life.”</p> <p>The MP said several Ilford South residents had told him they were deeply concerned about the safety of women and girls in the area. He added: “This attack demonstrates the deeply tragic and violent consequences of allowing this rhetoric to seep into mainstream dialogue.</p> <p>“It ends in brown and black people being verbally attacked, physically assaulted or in this case sexually assaulted – a crime rooted in misogyny and the assertion of power.”</p> <p>Other Labour MPs who have spoken on the incident include Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, representing Slough, who urged police to “take decisive action to deliver justice”, as well as MP for Tipton and Wednesbury Antonia Bance.</p> <p>West Midlands police said on Saturday that officers were continuing to investigate the case, with a number of positive lines of enquiry ongoing.</p> <p>Ch Supt Kim Madill, who leads local policing in the Sandwell area, said on Friday: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other inquiries well under way.</p> <p>“We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused, and I am speaking to people in the community today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to identify and arrest those responsible.</p> <p>“Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols in the area.”</p> <p>Police said anyone with information could contact them via 101 quoting log 798 of 9 September.</p>",

James Garner is once again a makeshift left-back after Vitaliy Mykolenko pulled out of Ukraine duty with an injury. Garner played there against Brighton during this ground’s christening and scored a peach, remember.</p> <p>The first decision a weekend set to be dominated by goalkeeping narrative has gone the way of Emi Martinez.

Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”</p> \n  <p>He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”</p> \n  <p>The problem for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a></strong> is that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.</p> \n  <p>They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts\">winter fuel duty</a></strong> decision, the freebies row and the handling of <strong>welfare cuts</strong> – have instead unleashed more chaos.</p> \n  <p>The most recent example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">sacking of </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">Peter Mandelson</a></strong>. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.</p> \n  <p>Then, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.</p> \n  <p>With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.</p> \n  <p>Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the <strong>NHS</strong>, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.</p> \n  <p>“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions.

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> \n  <p>Blake said last week’s reshuffle saw a “narrowing” of representation of different parts of the party in ministerial positions:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People just felt that it was such a large reshuffle and, you know, people who were actually delivering in their posts were moved. And it just kind of felt like there was a real narrowing in who was sat around the table, and that can’t be positive, because I think there’s a sense that the leadership don’t like to be challenged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the No 10 operation, she said it was “really embarrassing” if Starmer was not told about Lord Mandelson’s emails to <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> soon enough, amid suggestions <strong>Downing Street</strong> was aware of the messages before the prime minister defended the ex-ambassador on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Blake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the back benches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> \n   <p>Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also said backbenchers are frustrated after a number of “own goals” for the government. Blake, the MP for <strong>Sheffield Hallam</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it is “frustrating” that the good work the government has done is “not cutting through” and added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Instead, we’ve had a number of kind of own goals, and that has meant that we’ve slipped heavily in the polls, and that we seem to be more interested in focusing on each other rather than what’s in the best interest of the country at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are some other key developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</strong>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Senior Labour MPs and the UK’s largest anti-fascist campaign group have called on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> to mount a more heartfelt defence of diversity and anti-racism.</strong> They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lucy Powell has called for a “change of culture” inside Starmer’s Downing Street to make it more inclusive and better connected to MPs</strong>, promising that as Labour’s deputy leader she would when needed deliver difficult truths to the prime minister. Speaking to the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/phillipson-and-powell-confirmed-as-final-contenders-in-labour-deputy-race\">after she secured</a> 117 MP nominations in the battle to replace Angela Rayner, Powell said a sequence of what she called “unforced errors” by the government had left many Labour MPs and members frustrated.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The bill to legalise assisted dying is a “licence to kill” that puts vulnerable people at risk, Theresa May has said</strong>, as the legislation was <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/sept-2025/assisted-dying-bill-considered-by-lords/\">debated in the House of Lords</a> for the first time. The former prime minister said she opposed the bill because she said people in England and Wales with disabilities, chronic illnesses or mental health conditions could feel under pressure to end their lives, and “because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others”.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:27:54.210Z\">at 9.27am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c549378f0880bae9c52d8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:40:54.635Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ebere Eze</strong> makes his full Arsenal debut, replacing Gabriel Martinelli in one of three changes from the defeat at Arsenal. <strong>Martin Odegaard</strong> comes in for Declan Rice, who is rested, and <strong>Cristhian Mosquera</strong> covers for the injured William Saliba.</p> <p>Ange Postecoglou makes only one enforced change to the last Nottingham Forest XI selected by Nuno Espirito Santo. <strong>Morato</strong> comes in for the injured Ola Aina, which probably means a switch to right-back for Neco Williams.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-3-3)</strong> Raya; Timber, Mosquera, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Merino; Madueke, Gyokeres, Eze.<br><em>Subs: Kepa, White, Lewis-Skelly, Hincapie, Rice, Nwaneri, Dowman, Martinelli, Trossard.</em></p> <p><strong>Nottm Forest (4-2-3-1)</strong> Sels; Williams, Milenkovic, Murillo, Morato; Sangare, Anderson; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood.<br><em>Subs: Victor, Luiz, Kalimuendo, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee, Bakwa, Boly, Savona.</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Darren England.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2a1838f08671965418dbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:30:02.208Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Narrative is oxygen in modern football coverage, and we’ll all be gulping plenty of the good stuff this afternoon.

    "description": "<p>The sport, a popular pastime of the white elite during the colonial period, has struggled in recent years, but its fortunes may be changing</p>",
    "content": "<p>The spectators on the grandstand at Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi jumped to their feet as the horses competing in the fifth race of the Day of Champions – the last meeting of the season – came around the final corner on a recent Sunday afternoon. “Bedford! Bedford! Bedford,” some roared, punching the air as the horse, jockeyed by Michael Fundi, broke into a gallop on the home stretch, passed the leader, and stormed to victory.</p> <p>Fundi, who had started the day on top of the jockey standings, was crowned the season’s champion after the last race. At 20, he was the youngest in a decade.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Michael Fundi with Bedford after winning the 2400m Jockey Club Stakes George Drew Challenge Series. </p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: Kenya’s former president Uhuru Kenyatta presents the champion jockey plate to Fundi. Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.</p></li> </ul> <p>“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.</p> <p>Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.</p> <p>“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.</p> <p>Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses cross the finish line.</p></li> </ul> <p>Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.</p> <p>Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.</p> <p>The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers. </p> <p>Black trainers are making their mark too.</p> <p>Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.</p></li> </ul> <p>Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.</p> <p>He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.</p> <p>A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.</p> <p>Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.</p>    <ul> <li><p>James Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.</p></li> </ul> <p>The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.</p> <p>K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.</p> <p>Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.</p> <p>During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.</p> <p>Now the situation is improving with more local participation.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Crowds in the grandstand before a race.</p></li> </ul> <p>The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.</p> <p>At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuota<strong> </strong>acknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.</p> <p>“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.</p> <p>The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.</p> <p>Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Faces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul> <p> Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.</p> <p>“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”</p> <p>The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.</p> <p>“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses gallop down the final straight in a race. </p></li> </ul> <p>The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.</p> <p>Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.</p> <p>“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>The slain head of Turning Point USA stoked campus culture wars and ‘treated faculty and students as enemies’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Charlie Kirk, the far-right activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">killed this week</a> while speaking at a campus event at Utah Valley University, never graduated from the community college he briefly attended. But his lack of a degree didn’t stop him from assuming a defining role in the ongoing transformation of US higher education.</p> <p>Kirk pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement’s ideological agenda.</p> <p>“Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education.</p> <p>Kirk’s murder at the age of 31 followed more than a decade of on-campus activism, which was characterized by his staunch bigotry and Christian nationalism; hundreds of often incendiary “debates” – his favored medium; and the 2012 establishment of Turning Point USA, a conservative powerhouse that calls itself, with more than 900 chapters, the nation’s largest youth movement. Starting from his parents’ garage in suburban Chicago, Kirk often boasted, the movement grew one viral attack line at a time, supercharged by social media’s conflict-rewarding algorithms.</p>    <p>Kirk wore his lack of a degree as a point of “pride”, he told California governor Gavin Newsom in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XJ6rQDRKGA\">podcast interview</a> earlier this year, and as ammunition for his characterizations of American campuses as elitist and out of touch.</p> <p>“I didn’t even graduate community college,” Kirk said. “I represent most of the country. Actually, still, the majority of the country does not have a college degree and if I may, you know, bluntly critique the Democratic party, you guys have become so college-credentialed and educated that you guys snobbishly look on the muscular class of this country.”</p> <p>While Kirk had in recent years moved from campus activist to the upper echelons of Republican politics and Trump’s inner circle, on university campuses he will mostly be remembered for his role galvanizing the so-called “culture wars” with his regular diatribes against diversity initiatives, immigration and minority groups. Kirk emboldened conservative students to turn on faculty and classmates, established a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/17/turning-point-usa-professor-watchlist\">professor watchlist</a>” for faculty it accused of spreading “leftist propaganda”, and embarked on an anti-woke crusade that has since become official government policy.</p>    <p>“Turning Point was not the first group to target professors, and of course attacking higher education is not new,” said Matthew Boedy, a professor of English at the University of North Georgia who has been studying the group and its founder after being targeted on its watchlist. “What Turning Point did was take the traditional, old ways of conservatives fighting the culture war and translated it into millennial speak.”</p> <p>Katie Gaddini, a history professor at Stanford University who studies US conservatism, recalled seeing Kirk speak at an event years ago, where he boasted that if given 15 minutes with any college student, he could “de-program years’ worth of indoctrination”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: ‘prowling Blacks’ and ‘the great replacement strategy’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“His whole mission, and Turning Point’s original mission, was what he called de-programming the woke indoctrination that he thought was taking place on college campuses,” she said. “And of course, we’re seeing the contestation over what can be taught in college campuses playing out on a macro, policy-level scale right now.”</p> <h2>Beyond the campus wars</h2> <p>If Kirk’s aggressive, often rude style and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">frequent forays</a> into explicit racism and sexism ruffled feathers with more traditional conservative groups on campus, he quickly surpassed them in relevance. Boedy recalled attending an event with Kirk and Black conservative activist Candace Owens, a TPUSA veteran who resigned from the organization in 2019 after making comments in which she appeared to defend Adolf Hitler. When a group of Black students raised their fists and walked out of the event in protest, Kirk and Owens mocked them and stirred the crowd to cheer them off. “It was emblematic,” said Boedy. “They’re in it for the culture war and that does mean warring against other people.”</p> <p>Hasan Piker, a leftwing political commentator who rose to prominence about the same time as Kirk and had been scheduled to debate him in two weeks at Dartmouth College, said that while Kirk wasn’t the first to debate speakers on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, “he was able to serialize this format better than other people, especially because he had a lot of institutional backing”.</p> <p>“He was a true operative,” Piker added, noting that his relationship with Kirk had been “cordial” even as their worldview was “diametrically opposite”. Still, he cautioned against interpreting Kirk’s predilection for debates as a sincere effort to engage in an argument.</p>    <p>“It’s being presented right now with this notion that everyone was doing these debates because they wanted to arrive at the truth,” said Hasan. “The ultimate purpose of these sorts of debate culture, focused video sequences, is not to actually arrive at some kind of hidden truth through discourse or the Socratic method, but more so to just ritualistically humiliate your interlocutors.”</p> <p>Kirk’s influence soon expanded well beyond campuses, said Boedy, whose <a href=\"https://www.wjkbooks.com/bookproduct/0664269214-the-seven-mountains-mandate/\">forthcoming book</a> examines Kirk’s mobilization efforts in churches, media and beyond. “Turning Point expanded beyond merely college campus wars.

    "content": "<p>It was billed as the biggest game in Queensland ever: reigning AFL premiers Brisbane against their state rivals from down the M1. The long-derided Gold Coast had finally arrived as a force, winning an elimination final in an ecstatic finish over Fremantle, via a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/sep/08/afl-finals-gold-coast-suns-fremantle-dockers-david-swallow-nat-fyfe\">last-gasp point to retiring club great David Swallow</a>.</p> <p>For a short time, the semi-final looked like it might live up to its billing. And then it fell apart. The Suns barely fired a shot after half-time, overpowered by a manic Lions side desperate to atone after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">humiliated by Geelong</a> in Melbourne last week. Brisbane now face Collingwood in a preliminary final at the MCG on Saturday. Gold Coast are done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">Brisbane Lions roar into AFL preliminary final with statement win over Gold Coast Suns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Suns could hardly have started better. Ben King plucked a pack mark and kicked the first goal for a confidence boost after a poor first final. Matt Rowell tore through the next stoppage and his captain, and best mate, Noah Anderson, streamed in on the run for another. Shortly after, Rowell burst through another pack and King had his next opportunity.</p> <p>King matched up on Darcy Gardiner, a gamble on the part of Lions coach Chris Fagan as he tried to free up Harris Andrews in defence. A third mark and second goal to the Suns spearhead ensured the move was short-lived. Andrews went to King, and from there the Suns forward was barely sighted. Too often, he has no impact on a contest when he can’t get the ball himself.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>For a quarter and a half, the game went back and forth at a furious clip. Both sides were aggressive in their ball use. At half-back, Lions veteran Dayne Zorko sent low, scudding passes forward, scything through the Suns’ defence. Charlie Cameron and Cam Rayner, both of whom were poor against the Cats, roamed higher upfield, asking more questions of their opponents.</p> <p>After Andrews had taken King out of the equation, two players separated the contest. The first was Josh Dunkley, who tackled the Suns – and Rowell in particular – into submission. He laid 12 in the first half and finished with 18, a finals record. He gained a mere 62m for his side, but he cost the Suns a mile in return.</p>    <p>The other was Will Ashcroft. This was, it’s worth pointing out, just his 56th game, but last year’s Norm Smith medallist is already established as a rare finals performer. One of the few who could hold his head up in last week’s drubbing, Ashcroft split the game apart in the second quarter with his run, creativity and class.</p> <p>By the end of the first half, the Suns were losing their composure. A foolish 50m penalty a minute short of half-time ended with Zac Bailey in a full 5m of space at the fall of the ball. The margin was out to 25 points at the break. That’s nothing in today’s football, but the game already felt done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/ruthless-hawks-crush-lacklustre-crows-to-secure-preliminary-final-spot\">Ruthless Hawthorn crush lacklustre Adelaide to secure AFL preliminary final spot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were only sideshows after half-time, like the sight of Kai Lohmann rubbing his newly shorn dome for luck after losing his surfie blond locks during the week. There was also the sad sight of Swallow – the Suns’ last original recruit, and first pick in the 2010 draft – trotting around in his final game, his body broken by its relentless demands.</p> <p>Is there another player in the game who has shown such loyalty for as little team success as Swallow? I’m struggling to think of one. He’s been spare parts this year, used as the substitute in six of his nine games. But more than anyone over the journey, he’s shown the way for this club. Now they have to go on without him.</p>",

It’s really not surprising that they were flat, after making the longest trip in football the previous week, Brisbane to Perth, and not just that but beating Fremantle, winning their first final, and doing it in the dying seconds of the game.

What did they mean?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Investigators who found a bolt-action rifle near the site where Charlie Kirk was shot on a Utah campus said that they also found casings scrawled with messages.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, a 22-year-old college student was reported to have confessed to his family that he had shot and killed Kirk earlier this week. Robinson was arrested after his father recognised him in photos and video footage police released of the shooter escaping the scene.</p> \n  <p>One of the casings read, <strong>“hey fascist! CATCH! (up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols),”</strong>, according to an affadavit filed on Friday in a Utah court.</p> \n  <p>The arrows were most likely a reference to the popular video game Helldivers 2 and its sequence of controller moves to unleash a powerful bomb, according to an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">analysis </a>published by the New York Times.</p> \n  <p>Much of the other casings had similar messages steeped in video game references and allusions to different internet subcultures.</p> \n  <p>One of the messages, <strong>“Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,”</strong> is often used to mock participants in online role-play communities, namely furries. Another message said, <strong>“If you read This, you are GAY Lmao,”</strong> its tone suggestive of the kind of humour found on internet messaging boards.</p> \n  <p>Another casing read, <strong>“O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!,”</strong> likely a reference to the popular Italian folk song “Bella Ciao.” Popularised as an antifascist anthem in Italy after the second world war, it resurfaced globally in recent years because of its inclusion in the hit Netflix series “Money Heist” and in video games, including the first-person shooter game Far Cry 6.</p> \n  <p>The casing messages, like Robinson’s political ideology, are difficult to parse. The NYT has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">reported</a> that Robinson registered to vote in Utah, but is not affiliated with a political party and had never voted in an election, according to the Washington County Clerk.</p> \n  <p>His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c5627b8f084b3c85a4e1ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:25:26.026Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> on Friday “don’t even bother dealing with” the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare\">healthcare</a> priorities.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress\">Congress</a> is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives\">House of Representatives</a> have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.</p> \n  <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.</p> \n  <p>“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”</p> \n  <p>The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump\">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> Republicans passed in July.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c55d0f8f0880bae9c52e13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:16:46.019Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>What a swell party it was.

For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> \n  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-maga-influence\">Charlie Kirk and the rise of Maga in US politics: ‘He changed the ground game’</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c53fa38f0880bae9c52d44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:00:14.501Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: \"prowling Blacks\", \"some gun deaths\" worth it for second amendment right</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a>, the far-right commentator and ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, was killed on Wednesday doing what he was known for throughout his career – making incendiary and often racist and sexist comments to large audiences.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here’s Kirk, in his own words.

It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to “go” when you are. Just say when? </p> \n  <p>I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. </p> \n  <p>This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR.

Students at some schools spent hours hiding under desks, only to find out later the threat had been fabricated. On Thursday, several historically Black colleges locked down or canceled classes after receiving threats, a day after the fatal shooting of conservative activist <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> at a Utah college.</p> \n  <p>According to CNN’s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety, <strong>there have been 47 school shootings in the US so far this year, as of 10 September.</strong> Twenty-four were on college campuses, and 23 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 19 people dead and at least 77 other victims injured.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-killing-invoked-bolster-uk-largest-far-right-rally-decades\">mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</a>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe</strong>. The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A fundraising page, organised by Tucker Carlson’s nicotine pouch company ALP on the Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo, <strong>has already raised more than $3.7m for the Kirk family after ALP’s initial $1m donation. According to multiple sources, Kirk’s estimated net worth at the time of his death was $12m</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk\">Erika Kirk, widow of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk\">gave a combative speech</a> saying her late husband’s message and mission will be “stronger, bolder, louder and greater than ever”</strong> and that her “cries will echo around the world like a battle cry”. <strong>A</strong> <strong>tour of college campuses by his hard-right youth organization Turning Point USA would continue</strong>, she said, in her first public statement since her husband’s killing.

The Wall Street Journal initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump\">reported</a> on Thursday that an internal law enforcement bulletin said that ammunition recovered after the Charlie Kirk shooting was engraved with expressions of unspecified “transgender ideology”, but within an hour the New York Times, citing multiple sources, reported that these claims were likely not true. The WSJ has since posted an Editor’s Note saying that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “urged caution” around inaccurate reports of transgender engravings.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> told Fox &amp; Friends in an interview – during which he also announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">a suspect was in custody </a>– that <strong>he hoped the shooter “gets the death penalty”.</strong> He declined to call for the US to come together as a way of fixing the country’s divisions, saying “I couldn’t care less” and instead <strong>casting “vicious and horrible radicals” on the left of US politics as the sole problem</strong>.

    "description": "<p>The country’s finest male intellectuals – including some in positions of power – are weighing in on the matter </p>",
    "content": "<p>Should women in the US have the right to vote? You’d be forgiven for assuming this particular issue was sorted out quite a long time ago. But, because we live in hell, it seems the question is once again up for debate.</p> <p>Not by women, though; the fairer sex is obviously too emotional for such muscular discussion. So please sit this one out, ladies, and listen to what America’s finest male intellectuals have to say.</p> <p>First up is Braeden Sorbo, a 24-year-old conservative influencer and nepo baby (he’s the son of the Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo), who claims he is constantly harangued by women telling him how desperate they are to have their rights taken away.</p> <p>“I know more young women today who say they wish they didn’t ever get the right to vote than I’ve ever talked to in my life,” Sorbo <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/women-should-not-be-allowed-to-vote-conservative-influencer-braeden-sorbo-says/\">recently told</a> Richard Harris, host of the Truth &amp; Liberty<em> </em>YouTube show. Which rather raises the question: how many young women has Sorbo ever talked to in his life? Harris didn’t push Sorbo on the veracity of this anecdata, however. Instead he just gave a manly chuckle as Sorbo blamed all the ills of the world (abortion, feminism) on the 19th amendment.</p> <p>Per Sorbo, his female peers have also told him that “I would much rather give up my one right to vote if it meant 10,000 liberal women wouldn’t be allowed to vote, so that we could return to a better place”. (<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/many-such-cases\">Many</a> such cases!) He went on to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/kevin-sorbo-son-women-vote-b2823946.html\">say</a> that his ultimate vision is a “voting system based on Christian morals, which relates to married couples having one joint vote”.</p> <p>Perhaps you’re thinking: what does it matter what a 24-year-old jamoke on a far-right YouTube show says? I refer you to line three of paragraph one: it matters because we live in hell. In a normal world, Sorbo would be a fringe figure shouting into the ether who we could all happily ignore. But thanks in part to digital media, we don’t have that luxury any more. Sorbo has 1.9 million followers <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@braedensorbo?lang=en\">on TikTok</a>.; while some of his videos only get a few thousand views he has quite a few that top a million. </p> <p>More importantly, however, Sorbo’s views can no longer be dismissed as “fringe”. Rather, the idea that women shouldn’t vote is increasingly being co-signed and amplified by some of the most powerful people in America.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the US defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth\">Pete Hegseth</a>, shared a video on X in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/pete-hegseth-video-pastors-women-voting\">several pastors</a> say women should no longer be allowed to vote as individuals. “In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” one of the pastors in the <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1953626931234054558\">CNN clip</a> says. “I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.” While Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the video, he did retweet it with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life.”</p> <p>Slate then <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-women-voting-christian-nationa\">contacted</a> the Pentagon to give Hegseth a chance to clarify his thoughts on the matter. The reply wasn’t a straight answer; instead it just said Hegseth was a member of a church affiliated with Pastor Doug Wilson and “very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings”. Wilson is a Christian nationalist <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/women-rule/2025/08/15/christian-nationalists-target-womens-right-to-vote-00511090\">who has said</a> “women are the kind of people that people come out of” and written blogposts with titles such as “<a href=\"https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/s7-engaging-the-culture/the-lost-virtue-of-sexism.html\">The Lost Virtue of Sexism</a>”.</p> <p>Then there’s the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/19/jd-vance-trump-vp-pick-silicon-valley\">bankroll</a> JD Vance’s political career. Back in 2009, Thiel <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">published an essay </a>that argued it may have been a bit of an error to give women the right to vote. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” Thiel wrote.</p> <p>Thiel got a lot of flak for this and later <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-women-democracy_n_5747079be4b03ede4413f6f5\">clarified his statement</a>, saying: “It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away … While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.” Which is rather different from saying: “Of course women should have the right to vote, I’m mortified anyone misinterpreted my pretentious word salad.”</p> <p>Predictably, Elon Musk also has some views on this matter. While the tech billionaire (soon to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/elon-musk-trillion-dollar-pay-deal-tesla\">trillionaire</a>?) has never explicitly argued women shouldn’t vote, he has amplified tweets that undermine the idea of universal suffrage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/07/elon-musk-women-testosterone\">Last year</a>, for example, he wrote “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830390502836854925\">interesting observation</a>” on a retweet of a post by an account called Autism Capital which stated a “Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The same post argued “women and low T men” are “malleable” and can’t think freely. A year before, Musk appeared to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/elon-musk-children-voting-rights-b2369096.html\">endorse the idea</a> that “democracy is probably unworkable long term without limiting suffrage to parents”.</p> <p>The right are very good at shifting the Overton window <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/06/alt-right-politics-2016-andrew-marantz-antisocial-review\">in their favour</a> and propelling once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/anti-abortion-fetal-personhood\">fringe views</a> into the mainstream. They’re also adept at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/first-amendment-conservatives-supreme-court.html\">weaponizing</a> the law to help advance their agenda. They won’t be able to get rid of women’s voting rights overnight, of course. Just like the right to a legal abortion, they’ll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/31/congress-republicans-save-act-voting-rights\">chip away at it</a> gradually with bills that disenfranchise the “wrong” sort of people and <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/the-19th-amendment-is-under-attack-and-not-every-woman-has-an-equal-right-to-vote/\">mechanisms</a> that make voting more difficult. But we should not mistake their ultimate objective. Musk, Thiel and Hegseth are some of the most powerful people in the world: when they, along with influencers such as Sorbo, hint that they are interested in getting rid of women’s suffrage, we should take them very seriously indeed.</p> <p><strong>Texas professor fired after accusations of teaching ‘illegal’ gender identity<br></strong>Texas A&amp;M University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired\">fired a professor</a> on Tuesday after a viral video in which a student complained they were being taught illegal notions about gender identity.

    "description": "<p>As the rock band played the final stop of their sold-out reunion tour near LA, it was clear: Liam and Noel Gallagher have become icons stateside</p>",
    "content": "<p>After a crowd of nearly 90,000 finished singing Don’t Look Back in Anger, Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher had a question.</p> <p>“Are we dating?” he asked fans at the Rose Bowl, a stadium just outside Los Angeles, last Sunday night. “America, Oasis, the new hot couple, yeah?”</p> <p>If the Gallagher brothers and the United States are going steady, it comes after three decades of a turbulent, on-again, off-again relationship. But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear: Oasis has finally taken over America.</p>    <p>In the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes about <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOOr1l6j7fS/?hl=en\">newly minted Anglophiles</a> and joke <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWaoYxiazp/?hl=en\">T-shirts </a>saying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline in <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/oasis-rose-bowl-stadium-concert-tour-britannia-1236512226/\">Variety read</a>: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”</p> <p>That all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the band <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">has sold 7 million albums here</a>. But by comparison, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080058/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7511240/ask-billboard-rihannas-quirky-record-in-the-hot-100s-top-10-with\">Nirvana has sold more than 27 million</a> in the US; even Gin Blossoms <a href=\"https://www.ginblossoms.net/bio\">have sold 10 million</a>, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.</p> <p>“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam later <a href=\"https://lithub.com/shitholes-usa-noel-and-liam-gallagher-on-when-oasis-toured-america/\">said of the US</a>. It was a matter of contrast, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">New York Times</a> pointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.</p> <p>But in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience</p> <footer> <cite>an Oasis fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.</p> <p>The mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”</p>    <p>But LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, told <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/out-crystal-meth-tour-1994-1235088975/\">Rolling Stone</a>. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/oasis-reunion-melissa-lim-19730919.php\">San Francisco Chronicle in 2016</a>. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOTten1j3E0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">posted on Instagram</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/22/why-britpop-nostalgia-just-wont-go-away-robbie-williams-blur-oasis\">Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/opinion/oasis-tour-america.html\">Lizzy Goodman</a> points to the Gallagher brothers’ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-online-fights.html\">unfiltered, brash</a> personas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">timeless</a>, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.</p> <p>The US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”</p> <p>Maybe we finally have.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Reaction to the shocking killing of Charlie Kirk has largely overlooked the obvious: the country is awash with guns and people prepared to use them on fellow Americans</p>",
    "content": "<p>At 12.23pm on Wednesday, as the rightwing influencer and provocateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a> was addressing a large crowd at Utah Valley University, a single shot rang out. He was struck fatally by a bullet in the neck, sending thousands of screaming students scattering in all directions and propelling the country into a new and dangerous crisis.</p> <p>Exactly one minute later, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/11/evergreen-high-school-shooting-colorado-updates/\">at 12.24pm</a>, about 450 miles to the east in Colorado, a 911 call came in to first responders in the mountain town of Evergreen. A 16-year-old student had opened fire with a revolver on high school grounds, critically injuring two fellow students before turning the handgun on himself.</p> <p>The confluence of two bloody incidents just one minute apart – the first taking the life of a key figure in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, the second erupting in the same school district as the notorious 1999 Columbine massacre – underlined America’s dirty little non-secret: the ubiquitous, quotidian, nature of its gun violence.</p> <p>“Yesterday was a dark day in the United States,” the former Republican political strategist and Trump critic <a href=\"https://steveschmidt.substack.com/p/charlie-kirks-assassination-shows?utm_source=podcast-email%2Csubstack&amp;publication_id=836444&amp;post_id=173372847&amp;utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=play_card_play_button&amp;r=2318e&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Steve Schmidt</a> said on his podcast on Thursday. “It was a day of mass violence, of killing, of gun violence – in other words, in America it was a day like any other day.”</p> <p>The sense of shock that has ricocheted across the US since the Kirk shooting has been palpable. Cable news shows and social media feeds have been overflowing with intense browbeating and soul-searching about the parlous – and perilous – state of the nation.</p> <p>There have been umpteen calls to prayer, plenty of partisan name-calling, and even dark warnings about a coming <a href=\"https://x.com/Ben_J_Jeffery/status/1965936979528597886\">civil war</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/utah-residents-react-charlie-kirk-shooting\">A quiet Utah town reckons with Charlie Kirk’s shooting: ‘Nothing like this has happened here’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has been noticeable by its absence, though, is virtually any talk about the instrument that lies at the heart of America’s copious ongoing blood-letting: the gun.</p>    <p>“America is an insanely violent nation,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1965862561024454961\">Hasan Piker</a>, a progressive influencer who had been scheduled to debate with Kirk at a university in New Hampshire later this month. On his Twitch stream following the shooting, Piker lamented the lack of meaningful debate about reforming the country’s globally lax gun laws.</p> <p>“A bulletproof vest would not have saved Charlie Kirk. Security did not save Charlie Kirk. The only thing that could have potentially saved Charlie Kirk from getting shot in the neck was reasonable gun control.”</p> <p>Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of a book on the second amendment right to bear arms, Gunfight, told the Guardian that Americans had shown a stubborn resistance to gun safety reform through equally terrible shooting incidents in the past. They include horrors such as the killing of 20 elementary school children in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/newtown-shooting-gunman-kills-20-children\">Newtown, Connecticut</a>, in 2012, and the mass murder of 60 people five years later at a music festival in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives\">Las Vegas</a>.</p> <p>“People’s positions on the second amendment and gun policy have really hardened in recent years,” Winkler said. “It seems like Americans are impervious to shooting-based reforms, we’re just not seeing this. I don’t think this week’s tragedies are likely to shift the substance of the debate or the current stalemate on guns.”</p> <p>Kirk had been discussing gun violence at the moment that he was shot. Sitting on a sparkling cloudless day in the shade of a tent bearing the logo of his “American Comeback Tour”, the Turning Point USA leader was sparring by microphone with students over how many mass shooters in the past decade had been transgender.</p> <p>“Too many,” he said. (In fact, trans people have carried out a tiny fraction of mass shootings, the fact-checking group <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/09/trans-people-mass-shootings-gun-violence/\">Politifact</a> found.)</p> <p>Kirk’s own views on guns in America were reflective of the prevailing attitude across the Maga universe which is fiercely protective of the second amendment despite the evident side-effects of such devotion. Kirk being Kirk – his willingness to confront his detractors face to face was summed up in his slogan “Prove me wrong” – he articulated his passion for gun rights in brutally frank terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it’s worth it to have a cost of … some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Kirk</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a speech in Salt Lake City two years ago that has been widely resurfaced on social media in the wake of his death, Kirk argued that the benefits of having guns in many American hands outweighed the costs. Gun deaths were inevitable in such a heavily armed society, he admitted, but the prevalence of firearms allowed citizens to “defend yourself against a tyrannical government”.</p> <p>“I think it’s worth it,” he said. “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It’s rational.”</p> <p>Kirk went on to repeat the mantra that the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA) touted in the wake of the Newtown tragedy – the solution to gun violence is more guns. “If our money and our sporting events and our airplanes have armed guards, why don’t our children?”</p>    <p>Such a hardline pro-gun posture has been echoed by Trump. In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, in the early stages of his first term in the White House, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-endorsees-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-more-weapons\">Trump backed</a> raising the age of gun possession to 21, and even lent his name to comprehensive background checks which have long been a central demand of gun control advocates.</p> <p>It is not clear what made him change his mind – was it pressure from the NRA or from his own supporters? – but he quickly and quietly backed off the idea. The only change in gun policy in the second Trump administration has been in the direction of loosening regulations – his recent mega finance bill removed taxes from short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, and he has instructed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to aggressively <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/02/trump-gun-policy-executive-order-biden/\">roll back</a> measures to reduce gun violence introduced by his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Kirk assassination, Trump has signaled that he will be guided not by a desire to get to the root of the problem but by a desire for vengeance. He has <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115182892535295750\">blamed the shooting</a> on the “radical left”, disregarding recent atrocities against Democrats including the June shooting of Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-killings-melissa-hortman\">Minnesota lawmakers</a> in which one was killed.</p> <p>In a statement from the Oval Office, Trump has insinuated that he intends to crack down on leftist civil society organisations. There has so far been no talk of similarly cracking down on guns.</p> <p>“There’s just no way that Trump is going to support gun reform,” Winkler said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the bedrock causes of America’s unique struggle with gun violence goes untouched. An analysis by <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\">the Trace</a>, a news outlet reporting on the issue, estimates that there are almost 400m guns in circulation in the US – that’s more than the number of people living in the country.</p> <p>More than four in 10 Americans live in households with a gun, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/24/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">Pew Research Center</a>. Though there is a partisan political divide in ownership, with 45% of Republicans owning a gun, that still leaves one in five Democrats also holding deadly weapons.</p> <p>As the number of guns has risen, so too have gun deaths. Almost 47,000 people died by the gun in the US in 2023, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has produced official figures. That’s the third-highest year on record, after a pandemic-induced spike in the previous two years.</p>    <p>The argument frequently proffered by second amendment lobbyists that this is just the way it is can easily be squelched by comparison with other rich countries. A 2016 CDC study <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/05/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-us/#how-does-the-gun-death-rate-in-the-u-s-compare-with-other-countries\">cited by Pew</a> put the US gun death rate at 10.6 per 100,000 people – more than five times the rate in Canada (2.1 per 100,000), and almost 20 times that of Spain (0.6).</p> <p>Such alarming statistics are set against a powerful subculture in which the gun manufacturing industry and pro-gun groups and magazines actively promote the allure of the sniper. “Best civilian sniper rifles”, was the headline from <a href=\"https://gunmagwarehouse.com/blog/best-civilian-sniper-rifles/\">GunMag Warehouse</a>.</p> <p>The online site <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/guns/best-sniper-rifles/\">Outdoor Life</a> ran a feature on 16 of the “best sniper rifles”, defining the weapon broadly as the one that is “most capable of fulfilling the mission that whoever is carrying it is tasked with”. The author emphasised the huge variety of environments in which the sniper rifle has to operate, including “crowded cities”.</p> <p>First on the list was the AI AXSR which was praised for its “toughness, innovation, and accuracy”. The weapon <a href=\"https://www.milehighshooting.com/accuracy-international-axsr-338-lapua-mag-27-dark-earth/\">trades to civilians for $11,000</a> on online firearms sites.</p> <p>The gun that delivered the single shot that ended Kirk’s life has been described by US investigators as a Mauser high-powered bolt-action rifle. Though it was not a purpose-built sniper rifle it was precise enough to allow the killer to strike from a rooftop about 160 metres away from his target.</p> <p>Josh Sugarmann, executive of the Violence Policy Center which has tracked the proliferation of the sniper subculture, sees its growth as part of the increasing militarization of the gun industry and its civilian offerings. “No one notices or seems to care that there is an industry actively designing and building the weapons that enable shooters to more effectively commit assassinations and mass shootings,” he said.</p> <p>“The gun industry is designing, building and promoting rifles that are effective at much longer range with the goal of ‘one shot, one kill’.”</p>",

    "title": "When Mandelson met Maga: how Labour lord charmed Trump’s inner circle",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/13/peter-mandelson-maga-labour-lord-charmed-donald-trump-inner-circle",
    "description": "<p>Peter Mandelson was effective if controversial choice as ambassador before all went wrong ‘at worst possible time’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Peter Mandelson was in his element. Lounging on a sofa one June evening at Butterworth’s, a bistro serving as the gastronomical centre of the Maga movement in Washington DC, the recently appointed British ambassador was being honoured with a plaque that indicated he was easing his way into the conservative circles around Donald Trump.</p> <p>The appointment of Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair’s New Labour project in the 1990s, had not been without controversy. He was the first political ambassador to the United States in almost half a century and had twice resigned from Labour governments in the past over scandals (not to mention his past association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein).</p> <p>So he would have to move quickly to replace the well-sourced expertise of his predecessor and build ties with a new administration that had upended all the rules of the traditional Washington establishment.</p> <p>Mandelson managed that by leaning into the heady conservative politics surrounding the US president, working old contacts in Trump’s circles of businessmen and courting the new media right. Surrounded by conservative journalists that evening, he said that, while the two leaders’ politics may differ, both Trump and UK prime minister Keir Starmer were riding the same political winds of upheaval.</p> <p>Both had received mandates, he said that evening <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/trump-mandelson-trumpworld-plaque-vrmjrqcl2\">according to British media reports in the Times</a>, from “angry people who felt they were being unheard by mainstream politics” and were “angry about the cost of living, angry about uncontrolled immigration and angry about uncontrolled woke culture spreading across institutions”.</p> <p>It was a textbook performance for the once-dubbed “Prince of Darkness” who was testing the lines between ambassadorial deference and open flattery. In public, a favourite adjective for Trump was neutral but weighty: “consequential”. In private, he tended away from criticism of the new administration, even as the White House leaned toward Vladimir Putin and flirted with authoritarian measures at home.</p> <p>His firing now amid new details of the Epstein scandal – one that the Trump administration has sought to outrun – plays out just days before Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, when Starmer must seek to influence Trump over the war in Ukraine, continue negotiations over a US-UK trade deal, deflect concern over a potential UK recognition of Palestine, and more.</p> <p>“[Mandelson] has his own independent stature and status, and that was a good thing, but it carried risks, and now it’s gone wrong,” said Alexandra Hall Hall, a former British diplomat who resigned while serving as lead envoy for Brexit in the US in 2019. “And now it’s gone wrong on the worst possible topic at the worst possible time.”</p> <p>In Washington, the British ambassador’s Edwin Lutyens-designed residence, where Mandelson lived with his partner and “diplo-dog” Jock, hosted parties that saw an influx of the new conservative media elite in Washington. At a White House Correspondents’ Dinner co-hosted by the Daily Mail in June, new media influencers like Natalie Winters, seen as a protege of the rightwing firebrand Steve Bannon, rubbed shoulders with established journalists from across the media spectrum. It reflected the White House’s own inclusion of conservative bloggers among accredited correspondents as a counterweight to a perceived liberal bias among the media.</p> <p>At a celebration for King Charles’s birthday that month, Mandelson wryly inserted jokes about Trump as guests mingled among cigar and whiskey stations, drawing laughs as he recognised a leader “associated with grand ceremonies and golden aesthetics. So happy birthday, President Trump”.</p> <p>It is precisely what Mandelson was sent to Washington DC to do: charm the Maga faithful around Trump while bringing the political heft that would allow a UK envoy to negotiate in the name of the prime minister.</p> <p>He replaced Dame Karen Pierce, a veteran diplomat who was already a regular at Mar-a-Lago and one of the best-sourced foreign ambassadors in Trumpworld. Some, like Bannon, had rejected Mandelson as a “terrible choice” because of his past remarks about Trump and links to establishment politics in the UK.</p> <p>Yet Mandelson proved the doubters wrong, as at least one conservative outlet put it. His main success was the outlines of a US-UK trade deal, which was feted at an Oval Office meeting with Trump where Mandelson was complimented by Trump for his “beautiful accent” and given the floor in a rare show of deference to a foreign ambassador.</p> <p>The White House team around him laughed as he described Trump’s “typical 11th-hour intervention by you with your phone call demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected”. He then channelled Winston Churchill as he added: “For us it is not the end, it’s the end of the beginning.”</p> <p>His absence will be noted as Trump arrives in the United Kingdom for the controversial state visit that Mandelson’s quick-found relationship with the US president could have helped to smooth.</p> <p>After the Oval Office meeting with Trump, Mandelson left with a souvenir – a handwritten note in Trump’s distinctive marker scrawl and unmistakeable signature.</p> <p>“Peter,” it read. “Great Job!”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by Tommy Robinson to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p> \n<p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central London, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> \n<p>Other planned speakers on Saturday include Ant Middleton, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for Germany’s far-right AfD party and a far-right Polish MEP.</p> \n<p>Other Americans making the trip include Joey Mannarino, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump. </p> \n<p>However, there are doubts about whether one of the most high-profile speakers, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior Jordan Peterson, will appear.</p> \n<p>While he is listed in the lineup and has been a supporter of Robinson online, he has made no mention of the event recently. His appearance would also pose questions about his continued association with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists\">Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC)</a>, a yearly gathering in London involving businesses and conservatives that has included the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK.</p> \n<p>A pause on any new leave being booked has been imposed by police, who have had to contend with violence on the fringes of previous events involving Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.</p> \n<p>In a video to supporters on Thursday about the Kirk shooting, Robinson talked about “the bastard who has murdered him, or the organisation, the corporation or the government it is that has killed him”.</p> \n<p>A 22-year-old man, identified as Tyler Robinson by Spencer Cox, governor of Utah, was later arrested as a suspect in the fatal shooting.</p> \n<p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p> \n<p>The Stand Up to Racism march to a rally at Whitehall will be led by a Women Against the Far Right contingent including the MPs Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.</p> \n<p>“The far right are a menace to the whole of society. Their first targets, asylum seekers and Muslims, are broadening to all migrants, black people and on to trade unionists, all religious minorities and anti-racists,” said Abbott.</p> \n<p>Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: “This is going to be big, but we are also talking about movement to the right of Reform UK and we still don’t know where it is going.”</p> \n<p>Robinson also recently said he had joined Advance UK, a party set up by former senior figures in Reform UK, including Ben Habib, which will itself be formally launched next month.</p> \n<p>Robinson has increasingly pivoted towards an outwardly Christian nationalist position, particularly after his release from his latest prison sentence. Christian nationalists will be among the crowd, but a large section are expected to be drawn from the ranks of those who have taken part in the recent wave of protests outside asylum-seeker accommodation.</p> \n<p>As with other Robinson events, the core of support is also expected to come from a network of football fan and hooligan firms that are also involved in the English Defence League (EDL).</p> \n<p>Lowles posed the question: “What does this rally signify politically? One scenario is that people will coalesce around Tommy Robinson and Advance UK, but it will require him to step up.”</p> \n<p>“A lot of what he does is about himself and he’s been engaged in a huge amount of merchandising for this event, as well as constant appeals for money towards a goal of about £300,000. What will he do with it? Advance UK need him more than he needs them, but equally this could become part of his fight with Farage.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police has been engaged in discussions with Robinson before the event. The force does not give permission for protests but requires advance notice of a procession to allow for appropriate planning.</p> \n<p>A Met spokesperson said: “Saturday will be a busy day in London and officers will be on duty in significant numbers to keep people safe.”</p> \n<p>The force said Muslim Londoners should not change their plans in light of the rally.</p> \n<p>Commander Clair Haynes, who is in charge of the public order policing operation in London this weekend, said: “We recognise that there are particular concerns for many in London’s Muslim communities ahead of the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest given the record of anti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents of offensive chanting by a minority at previous marches.</p> \n<p>“There have been some suggestions that Muslim Londoners should change their behaviour this Saturday, including not coming into town. That is not our advice.</p> \n<p>“Everyone should be able to feel safe travelling into and around London.”</p> \n<p>As well as Robinson’s rally, which is styled as a “free speech festival” and will take place at the southern end of Whitehall after a march from Waterloo, the counter-protest by Stand Up to Racism will take place at the northern end of Whitehall, after a march from Russell Square.</p> \n<p>“There are a number of other events taking place on the same day, including multiple football fixtures, which will all form part of the policing operation,” the Met spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Duo are the most productive T20 openers, with Salt’s goal to be ‘best in the world’ after record innings against South Africa</p>",
    "content": "<p>As he reflected on his epic individual contribution to a thrilling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">historic win for England</a> against South Africa on Friday, Phil Salt spoke about being inspired to ever greater heights by the people around him. “The mentality that we’ve had from when I started playing for England to now, we’re always trying to push things forward,” he said. “Always trying to take, you know, the next step in the game.”</p> <p>But over the past few years most of the steps taken by the white-ball side have been backwards. It is the Test team under Ben Stokes that have produced the thrills, while in shorter formats there has been a succession of spills. Jos Buttler, by general acclamation England’s greatest short-format player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/28/jos-buttler-steps-down-as-captain-of-englands-white-ball-cricket-team\">stood down as captain</a> in February after three years that started with victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup but came to be characterised by failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">Records tumble as Phil Salt’s stunning ton leads England to T20 rout of South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buttler, however, is now adding fresh gloss to his reputation and in the past week has looked in brilliant touch in scoring a 32-ball 62 in England’s one-day international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">romp against South Africa</a> in Southampton, being the only English batter to flourish in the abbreviated five-over thrashfest that launched the T20 series in Cardiff, and again at Old Trafford on Friday night, where he and Salt joyfully and emphatically reclaimed the opening berths.</p> <p>With Salt on paternity leave and Buttler at No 3, Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett opened during the T20 series against West Indies in June. But, with a breathless summer behind them and a hectic winter ahead, both were rested for these games and in their absence Salt and Buttler have reunited to make the idea of picking anyone else appear absurd.</p> <p>That Buttler dominates the list of England’s most-successful T20 opening partnerships is no surprise, but the fact he and Salt have been so productive as a pairing perhaps is. In 17 innings they have scored 967 runs, one short of the total Buttler and Jason Roy accumulated in 31, at an average of 60.43.</p> <p>Of all opening pairings with at least 15 outings over the past decade, none comes close to matching them, the only other couple averaging above 47 being Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz on 53.86. No other representatives of Test-playing nations get within sniffing distance of their run rate of 10.52.</p> <p>“We bounce off each other well,” Salt said. “We’ve got pretty set roles – it’s my job to get us off to as good a start as possible and give Jos the opportunity to take a couple of balls, because when he does he goes on and gets a match-winning score a lot of the time. We don’t often need to communicate. When he needs to get me on [strike], it just happens. And when I need to get him on. There’s no ego or anything like that, we just do it, and that’s a massive part of having a good opening partnership.”</p>    <p>Salt produced England’s highest T20 score with an unbeaten 141 on Friday, his fourth century in the format (Buttler has one, in more than three times as many innings). But there are many ways the former captain has assisted Salt’s success. The way they work together at the crease is the most obvious, but Buttler was also the inspiration and the challenge that pushed Salt to focus in particular on attacking the first over, something he now does better than any batter in the world.</p> <p>“In order to knock a man out of possession, you need to do something they can’t do,” Salt said. “I thought: ‘Right, if I can be the most dangerous in the first six, 10, 15 balls of the game, that’s quite a unique tool.’ I’m someone who’s always looking at ways to get better. The goal is to be right up there. I want to be the best in the world at this.”</p> <p>Perhaps England can rationally nurse that same goal, with another World Cup to be played in India and Sri Lanka in February. But first comes Sunday’s series decider at Trent Bridge and the challenge of proving that Friday was more than a glorious anomaly.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence is changing how students learn and the world they’ll graduate into. Experts reveal how applicants can get ahead</p>",
    "content": "<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”</p> <p>Altman, whose company developed and released ChatGPT in November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.</p> <p>Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.</p> <p>For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in&nbsp;many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.</p> <p>“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”</p> <p>His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”</p> <p>Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.</p> <p>He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.</p> <p>“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”</p> <p>There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”</p> <p>Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.</p> <p>“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”</p> <p>For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.</p> <p>He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.” </p> <p>Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.</p> <p>Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”</p> <p>Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”</p> <p>In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.</p> <p>“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Just seven runners at Doncaster but plenty of depth and the appearance of a Derby winner adds significant interest </p>",
    "content": "<p>Just seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and features the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.</p> \n<p>Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/brighton-owner-tony-bloom-nets-another-winner-with-santorini-star-at-doncaster-horse-racing\">Brighton owner Tony Bloom nets another winner with Santorini Star at Doncaster</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.</p> \n<p>All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.</p> \n<p>He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip. Scandinavia and Carmers will offer strong opposition, but <strong>Lambourn (3.40)</strong> has been edging ever close to the top of the betting in recent days and still looks fairly priced at about 5-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76eabbec-cd0a-4d04-9a3e-338198e48c4b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster </b>1.15 Treble Tee 2.50 Gewan 2.25 Apollo One (nap) 3.00 Shadow Of Light 3.40 Lambourn 4.15 Mr Wonka 4.50 Fantasy Believer</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield </b>1.25 One Million Dreams 1.58 Beccadelli 2.33 Rogue Dynasty 3.13 Kingsclere 3.55 Summertime Blues 4.30 Parish Councillor 5.00 Clearpoint</p>\n    <p><b>Chester </b>1.35 Wild Dahlia 2.05 Military Academy 2.40 Ndaawi (nb) 3.23 Hanney Girl 4.00 Glistening Nights 4.35 Giant 5.05 Heathen 5.35 Sir Edward Lear</p>\n    <p><b>Bath </b>3.28 Somebodycomegether 4.05 Cloudbuster 4.40 Under Curfew 5.10 Goodwood Mogul 5.40 Tamzan 6.13 Baynoona 6.45 Blue Point Express 7.15 Mrs Meader</p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh </b>4.10 Martin’s Brig 4.45 Welbury 5.18 Straight Ahead 5.50 Penn Avenue 6.22 Maghlaak 6.52 Red Mirage 7.22 Sixcor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.15</strong> Easier ground could be what <strong>Treble Tee</strong> needs to return to winning form after excellent efforts in defeat on his last two starts.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.50</strong> <strong>Gewan </strong>showed a good attitude to maintain his unbeaten record at York last month and is narrowly preferred to Oxagon, a wide-margin winner last time out.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.05</strong> There is little to choose between Hamish, the warm favourite, and <strong>Military Academy</strong> on their form at Goodwood in June, so a 3lb swing in favour of John &amp; Thady Gosden’s gelding makes him a logical pick at the likely odds.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 2.25</strong> <strong>Apollo One </strong>has been operating below his best so far this season but he was an unlucky loser of this race 12 months ago, behind a subsequent Group One winner in American Affair, and is 1lb lower in the ratings this time around.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.40</strong> Gordon Elliott’s <strong>Ndaawi </strong>trailed home in last place in the Cesarewitch on his latest start on the Flat but two big runs in ultra-competitive handicap hurdles since that setback suggest that he remains well handicapped on the level.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 3.00</strong> A slight ease in grade could see <strong>Shadow Of Light, </strong>last year’s Dewhurst winner, gain a confidence-boosting win.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7857ae84-4e63-4c8f-aa77-f7c4847110de\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster</b> 1.20 Stormy Monday 1.55 Obito 2.30 Indian Springs 3.00 Royal Velvet 3.35 Beaming Light 4.10 Queen Of Mougins (nb) 4.40 Hiya Maite 5.18 Arnhem&nbsp;<br><b>Bath</b> 2.00 Spinning Dancer 2.35 Karakula Dancer 3.08 Bohemian Breeze 3.43 Asinara 4.18 Supreme Diamond 4.50 Call Time 5.28 Albus Anne&nbsp;<br><b>Musselburgh</b> 2.15 Farandaway 2.50 Parisian Scholar 3.25 Rory The Cat 4.00 Drumcondra (nap) 4.33 I’m Next 5.08 This Years Love 5.43 Sanditon</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sweet William is punters’ darling again</h2> \n<p>There are horses that win with a minimum of fuss, and others, like Sweet William, that have a style that is all their own, and John &amp; Thady Gosden’s stayer kept it interesting throughout in the Doncaster Cup on Friday, as he overcame a slow start and some early coaxing from Rab Havlin in his saddle to win the Group Two contest for the second year running.</p> \n<p>Sweet William has often appeared to have his own ideas about the racing game during a 20-race career, with slow starts and mid-race flat spots frequently forcing Havlin to get busy at an early stage.</p> \n<p>When he eventually goes through the gears, however, he is a very difficult horse to keep out of the frame, and while his latest win was his first since the same race 12 months ago, his fourth-place finish in this year’s Ascot Gold Cup was the only time he has been outside the first three. His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.</p> \n<p>Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.</p> \n<p>Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”</p> \n<p>There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn. “Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”</p> \n<p>An impressive display of raw, frontrunning speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.</p> \n<p>“She’s a natural frontrunner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>It sounds like the premise of a new reality show: take four strangers, isolate them in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/12/nasa-texas-humans-prepare-mars\">3D-printed Martian habitat</a> for more than a year, and watch them tackle equipment failures, communication delays and attempts to grow vegetables. In fact, it is a scientific simulation – and for the first time a British pilot is among those training for the mission.</p> <p>Laura Marie, who was born in the UK and is now a pilot for a regional airline in the US, beat about 8,000 applicants to become one of six research volunteers who are preparing to spend 378 days inside the 158-sq-metre (1,700 sq ft) Mars Dune Alpha habitat at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p> <p>“It’s such a huge opportunity,” Marie told the Guardian. “And then to come this far and be in the final crew selection and heading down to training very, very soon is extremely exciting.”</p> <p>While the four “primary” crew members – Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery and James Spicer – are expecting to enter the simulation on 19 October, Marie – who has a BA in philosophy and an MSc in aeronautics – is one of two “alternate” participants, ready to step in should any of the others drop out.</p> <p>Marie said: “I am going down there with the same kind of mindset that everyone is going down there, of it being the 378 days.”</p> <p>The second of three Chapea (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/chapea/\">Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog</a>) missions, the experience is designed to help inform crewed missions to the red planet itself. The idea is the simulations will enable the collection of data relating to the physical health, psychology and performance of humans undertaking such an endeavour, with Nasa saying it could also aid assessment of its space food system.</p> <p>As in the first mission, the new crew will be growing crops, carrying out robotic operations and conducting simulated Mars walks, as well as testing technology designed for use on Mars, among other activities.</p> <p>“With science, you can’t just do something once,” said Marie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">Life on Mars ‘absolutely exhilarating’: Nasa scientist’s year in a simulation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marie, who grew up in Devon and immigrated to the US in 2016, said she was inspired to apply after hearing about the first mission as it was in progress.</p> <p>“I always had an interest professionally in working with Nasa in some kind of capacity,” she said. “So everything kind of aligned. I saw that opportunity and I jumped for it.”</p> <p>However while the first mission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">ended in the summer of 2024</a>, Marie has not spoken to the crew involved, noting it is better for the data if team members are not influenced by the experiences of others.</p> <p>While training is set to start next week at the Johnson Space Center, Marie said she and the other team members had already spent time together as part of the rigorous and lengthy selection process.</p> <p>“I’m not worried about any of the crew dynamics. I would happily lock myself in a box with all of them,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/12/nasa-texas-humans-prepare-mars\">Inside the 3D-printed box in Texas where humans will prepare for Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the mission could still bring challenges. “I’m a big nature girl. I spend a lot of time outside,” Marie said, adding the lack of sensations such as wind in her hair or the smell of grass could be difficult.</p> <p>Another significant challenge will be the communication delays that are designed to mimic the lag astronauts would experience on Mars when contacting Earth.</p> <p>“There’s no live chat with mission control,” said Marie, noting that even on the international space station, astronauts can be in real-time contact with Earth.</p> <p>But there will also be downtime, with Marie revealing she will be packing a Rubik’s Cube. “I’m not just going to learn how to do it. I want to beat a record,” she said.</p> <p>While the new mission is only a simulation of the Martian landscape, Marie said she would jump at an opportunity to head to the red planet itself. Indeed Nasa is developing technologies to enable crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.</p> <p>“One hundred per cent I would take that seat on that ride if it were ever offered to me,” Marie said. “I think the whole multi-planetary species, it’s where we’re heading. And anything I can do to be a part of it – if it’s this [Chapea programme], if it’s something else – I’m just happy to be involved.”</p>",

Even as a young child, angels regularly spoke to me.”</p> <p>She added that “since I was born, I have also received constant communications in the form of visions” and that “eventually, every single one of them came to pass”.</p> <p>In the book, Brianna Ladapo claims she went on a “<a href=\"https://canvasrebel.com/meet-brianna-ladapo/\">pilgrimage</a>” trip to Egypt in graduate school during which she saw the rest of a “recurring vision” from a past life.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">video podcast on Rumble</a> earlier this year, she reiterated these claims about her “gifts”.</p> <p>“I was born a very sensitive child, the kind of kid who would see angels and talk to beings that no one else could necessarily perceive,” she said, claiming her family “perceived what was happening to me as satanic and demonic and evil”.</p> <p>“I saw a lot of angels, but my angels would talk to me and they saved my life multiple times,” she claimed.</p> <p>Brianna Ladapo also claimed their children together “have all been having experiences like this since they were born” and have “innate divine intelligence”.</p> <p>She claimed one of her children as a baby had “a gift” that was temporarily shared with her.</p> <p>“I started to hear conversations that sounded like they were right next to me. There were no people anywhere near us. And they were clearly from different eras, sometimes different countries, different languages and dialects,” Ladapo said.</p> <p>She said initially in their relationship, her husband was skeptical, but came to believe in her “gifts”.</p> <p>“After a number of years, he came to deeply trust my gift and now he won’t work with anybody I haven’t vetted,” she said. The couple did not respond to requests for comment about Brianna Ladapo’s vetting.</p> <p>Later in the podcast, Ladapo claimed she floated an inch above the ground during a session with a former Navy Seal and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christopherleemaher/?hl=en\">self-proclaimed traditional healing guru</a>, whom she said her husband had also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6929057317183203\">seen</a> and had similar experiences with. The healer declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.</p> <p>Ladapo is also a proponent of the chemtrails <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">conspiracy theory</a> about planes mass-dumping chemicals. She claims in the podcast interview that she and her children got sick because of chemtrails, and she used a patch that has been characterized as<a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/pseudoscience-technology/patchy-science-lifewaves-mysterious-patches\"> pseudoscience</a> by medical experts.</p> <p>“As we try to chase down where this is coming from, who is funding the companies who are flying the planes, who are piloting these planes, where are they taking off? We don’t even know where they are, because none of this is on the books.” Ladapo said about chemtrails.</p> <p>She added in the <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">podcast interview</a> about a photo of a Florida sky outside of her home: “This is how the chemtrails have been looking outside our window for the past few weeks. They are, I hate to say it, but that looks like a pentagram and they’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks.”</p> <p>She characterized the perceived chemtrailers as “dark forces” out to get her and her husband.</p> <p>“They’ve been trying to stop us for years,” she claimed. “We are operating at a level of light that puts us essentially out of the grasp of those with a very low vibration, very evil intention.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Marina Ramazashvili says son, Giorgi Bachiashvili, was the victim of a ‘vendetta’ by billionaire politician</p>",
    "content": "<p>The mother of a jailed former aide to Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused the de facto leader of Georgia of treating her son as his “personal prisoner” as she appealed to the west for help.</p> <p>Marina Ramazashvili, a renowned ophthalmologist in Georgia, said Giorgi Bachiashvili, who has allegedly been beaten in his prison cell, was the victim of a “vendetta” waged by the billionaire politician.</p> <p>The Georgian government, led by Ivanishvili, has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/mamuka-mdinaradze-to-be-georgia-security-chief-as-report-warns-of-descent-into-authoritarianism\">slipping into autocracy</a>, with the courts and the prosecution service increasingly under political control.</p> <p>“Maybe he is evil,” Ramazashvili, 65, said of Ivanishvili. “He has no humanity, he has no empathy. My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.</p> <p>Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.</p> <p>At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.</p> <p>Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/giorgi-bachiashvili-interview-georgia-bidzina-ivanishvili\">claimed in an interview with the Guardian</a> from his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.</p> <p>Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.</p> <p>Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.</p> <p>He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.</p> <p>He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.</p> <p>A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.</p> <p>“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”</p> <p>Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.</p> <p>Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.</p> <p>She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”</p> <p>Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.</p> <p>Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.</p> <p>“I have nothing inside,” she said.</p>",

    "title": "Partial to pre-drinks and a party? Your guide to getting the most out of student nightlife",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife",
    "description": "<p>The social side of university is good for your mental health and friendship circle, so consider where you’d be happiest to hang out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Choosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing.</p> <p>“Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the university <a href=\"https://yorksu.org/activities/view/album-society\">album society</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”.</p> <p>“Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs.</p> <p>But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan.</p> <p>“A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.”</p> <p>Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities.</p> <p>The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink.</p> <p>So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequently<a href=\"https://www.studentcrowd.com/page/best-universities-for-students-union\"> ranked best in the UK</a>, while the city’s DIY music scene<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/23/not-all-grassroots-venues-are-struggling-sheffields-leadmill-may-be-closing-but-the-citys-diy-hubs-are-thriving\"> continues to thrive</a>. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds.</p> <p>For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as&nbsp;possible. “You only get the university experience&nbsp;once.”</p>",

It was a moment – six Premier League games into his tenure – when people wondered whether his team might be the real thing. In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> \n  <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c544f78f086519d32714f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:26:00.709Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news: Arsenal v Nottingham Forest</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Eberechi Eze starts for the Gunners,</strong> as does Cristhian Mosquera with William Saliba out.

The defending champions have won all three of their fixtures so far but required late goals against Bournemouth and Newcastle after twice conceding two-goal leads, which pointed to defensive frailties.</p> \n  <p>Against Burnley on Sunday he will again need those resources up front - now bolstered by British-record signing Alexander Isak - against a team they will find hard to break down. Liverpool have scored eight goals, the most in the top flight, without creating that many clear-cut chances and Slot was asked how he hoped to improve that.</p> \n  <p>“To implement as best as possible the way we want to play,” he said.”But in the end the final third, it is also the form of your wingers mainly because of their playing style you end up more on the sides. The better they are, the bigger threat they are, the more chances we will generate and then nine out of 10 times it is about scoring.</p> \n  <p>“If you can score an early goal that normally helps you in a game like that. There are a lot of factors going into a game like this but as always we are hoping that our attackers make the difference and that is what they have to do every single game.”<br>But while Slot wants them to score the goals he also wants his attackers to improve their work-rate and defensive capabilities.</p> \n  <p>“If we lose the ball if we are really good in our counter-pressing that can create chances as well,” he added. “That is for me the biggest lesson of our game against Arsenal: in the first half we weren’t front-footed enough in terms of our pressing. In the second half we were and as a result we deserved to score in the second half.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c527628f084b3c85a4e024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:15:33.522Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Talking of Fitba, this piece, from the consistently excellent Nutmeg, is terrific*</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/smartphones-eroding-experience-watching-football-phones-escapism-games-impatiece\">Are smartphones eroding the experience of watching football?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><em>* Opinion, not fact</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c526928f084b3c85a4e021\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:11:47.681Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>As well as the big game at Easter Road, Rangers host high-flying Hearts at Ibrox with Russell Martin still looking for his first league win. </p> \n  <p>Rangers have drawn all four Premiership games under Martin, including a forgettable derby a fortnight ago.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report\">Martin and Rodgers feel heat as Rangers and Celtic fans boo drab stalemate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c4289b8f0880bae9c524f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:00:07.094Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arsenal v Nottm Forest x Big Ange (12.30pm)</strong></p> \n  <p>Will Unwin looks at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f8elrGU3AdU\">Nottingham Forest’s surprise decision</a> to sack Nuno Espírito Santo and replace him with Ange Postecoglou.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78b2d1ec-a634-45bc-a0b9-378ce95a2ca3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yz3PD1i880A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c523b68f084b3c85a4e012\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T07:58:33.988Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>“Oh matchday live, how could you?” <s>thunders</s> says Simon McMahon. “You forgot about about Dundee United’s trip to Easter Road to face Hibs at 5.45pm, so please, allow me.

It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only.

Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks.

A <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/bring-skinny-jeans-back\">recent GQ article</a> from July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/sperry-boat-shoes-hooked-me\">Another GQ article from this year</a>, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, or <a href=\"https://bamfstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wowspolo-main.jpg\">Jordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime</a>.</p> <p>I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)\">The Crow</a>. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.</p> <p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.</p> <p>I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.</p> <p>Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.</p> <p>The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/10/pradas-125bn-versace-takeover-a-new-era-for-italian-luxury\">controlled by billionaire conglomerates</a> that care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion is <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/shein-designated-biggest-fashion-polluter-bb25de66/\">contributing to global pollution</a> at an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.</p> <p>Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist</p></li> </ul>",

The illness is usually self-limiting. Most cases lasting up to two weeks.</p> <p>A small proportion of patients, mainly children, could develop life-threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure. A similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may also develop in a small proportion of adults.</p> <p>Stec bacteria are most prevalent in cattle in the UK, but have also been found in the faeces of deer, rabbits, horses, pigs and wild birds.</p> <p>Government guidance says the strain is particularly infectious because very few bacteria are needed to cause illness, allowing the disease to spread easily within families and other settings such as hospitals and schools.</p> <p>People can become ill through eating contaminated food, contact with infected animals or people who have the illness, and drinking water from inadequately treated sources.</p> <p>The UK Health Security Agency said there were 2,544 cases of Stec infection in England in 2024, a 26% rise compared with the year before.</p> <p>Several supermarkets were forced to ditch products in June last year when the sandwich makers Greencore and Samworth Brothers recalled their items during another outbreak of E coli.</p> <p>The two producers had to recall 60 products found to contain a variety of salad leaf linked to a Stec outbreak.</p>",

    "description": "<p>PM understood not to have seen messages from former ambassador to sex offender when speaking in Commons</p>",
    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer defended Peter Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and Jeffrey Epstein were passed to Downing Street, according to reports.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA.</p> <p>The prime minister is understood not to have been aware of the contents of the emails until Wednesday evening. By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer and Labour MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”. <br><br>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.</p> <p>“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> <p>“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”</p> <p>She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.</p> <p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”</p> <p>He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.</p> <p>The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.</p> <p>It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.</p> <p>His friendship with Epstein was known before his appointment, however, and he is reported to have told the Times that he admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with the convicted sex offsender for many years.</p> <p>Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer has “confidence in his top team” when asked whether questions had been raised over the judgment of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was reported to have lobbied for Mandelson’s appointment.</p> <p>The backbencher Clive Lewis publicly questioned Starmer’s leadership, telling the BBC the prime minister does not seem “up to the job”.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, another MP from the party’s backbenches, said “toxic” resentment was festering among the party’s MPs and rank and file members.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, one of two candidates to take Angela Rayner’s place as Labour’s deputy leader, called for a change of culture.</p> <p>“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” she said.</p> <p>Downing Street has been contacted for comment.</p>",

He spent weeks in the spotlight last year due to the tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, including spectacles and clothes donations to Starmer’s wife, Victoria. Starmer has also made temporary use of a £18m penthouse that belonged to Alli.</p> <p>No-fault evictions are one of the leading causes of homelessness, according to the charity Shelter, because they give landlords the power to evict tenants with just two months’ notice, without giving any reason for the eviction.</p> <p>The father of the family who was evicted from Alli’s house told the i newspaper they pleaded with the property’s management agent to allow them to meet the increased asking price and stay in the property: “We have children who were settled in local schools … so we wanted to avoid the disruption if we could.</p> <p>“We asked if there was any chance that we could even just stay an extra month so the kids wouldn’t be disrupted in September, and we could get through exams, but it was a no.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/labour-deputy-contender-lucy-powell-calls-for-culture-change-at-no-10\">Labour deputy contender Lucy Powell calls for culture change at No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking on Alli’s position as a Labour peer and major donor, the father added: “The hypocrisy just feels like too much … I voted Labour and I’m just incredibly disappointed.”</p> <p>Before Labour came to power, the government promised to “immediately abolish no fault eviction”, but has yet to name an implementation date for the renters’ rights bill.

She said: “Lord Alli is not a commercial landlord and he doesn’t manage – and has never managed – this property. This is his former home where he no longer lives and where one tenant was replaced with another for less money than the former tenant offered and at an amount lower than the market price. Clearly, this was not about money.”</p> <p>The news comes a month after Rushanara Ali resigned as the government’s homelessness minister after it emerged she had evicted four tenants from a property she owns, then re-let it weeks later for £700 more a month.</p>",

Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p> <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\" data-alt=\"Inflation chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p> <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p> <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p> <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p> <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p> <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p> <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p> <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p> <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p> <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\" data-alt=\"jobs chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs.

    "description": "<p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas, new report says, amid low awareness of disease</p>",
    "content": "<p>In February, Luna donated blood at her high school in Miami, with the goal of helping save others.</p> <p>“She was very proud to come home and say, ‘I gave blood today,’” her mother, Valerie, said. (The Guardian is not using the mother or daughter’s full names to protect their privacy.)</p> <p>It turned out, she was not able to save someone else’s life but potentially prevented herself from having serious health issues.</p> <p>A couple months later, she received a letter from the blood donation company informing her that she could not give blood. She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.</p> <p>Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.</p> <p>“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,’ … you’re like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.</p> <p>Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.</p> <p>Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.</p> <p>They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.</p> <p>“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”</p> <p>Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p> <p>It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.</p> <p>Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.</p> <p>About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.</p> <p>It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(10)01160-1/fulltext\">Gastroenterology journal</a>.</p> <p>More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs’ natural environment”, Beatty said.</p> <p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC’s <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article\">Emerging Infectious Diseases</a> journal.</p> <p>But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2953998/\">2010 survey</a> conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.</p> <p>“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that’s something that doesn’t exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.</p> <p>But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)</p> <p>Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.</p> <p>“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.</p> <p>After Valerie received the letter about Luna’s infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.</p> <p>That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.</p> <p>Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.</p> <p>Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.</p> <p>The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.</p> <p>The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.</p> <p>While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it’s less likely, Beatty said.</p> <p>“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”</p>",

Donald Trump Jr danced to YMCA while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NujJmSMi49k\">JD Vance quipped</a>: “They don’t tell you when you run for vice-president that you get brought on stage with the Village People.”</p> <p>Guests at the $15,000-a-head <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/editorial-images/news/event/turning-point-inaugural-eve-ball-held-in-washington-d-c/776267713\">Turning Point Inaugural Eve Ball</a> last January included future FBI director Kash Patel, Jeanine Pirro and the Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor. But towering above them all, literally and figuratively, was Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and key enabler of the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Kirk, a 31-year-old rightwing activist, podcaster and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was killed on Wednesday</a> by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah. For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> <p>Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile\">grew up in an affluent suburb</a> of Chicago, the son of an architect whose firm designed the Trump Tower in New York. Rejected by the military academy at West Point, Kirk was 18 when he launched the grassroots organisation Turning Point USA in 2012, later admitting that he had “no money, no connections and no idea what I was doing”.</p> <p>Kirk’s rhetorical gift for provocative statements, inflaming cultural tensions and “owning the libs” galvanised conservative students during the Barack Obama years. He held mass rallies that drew tens of thousands of young voters each year to hear conservative leaders speaking on glitzy stages backed by ear-splitting anthems and bright pyrotechnics.</p> <p>He was the right man at the right time to pour rocket fuel on Trump’s Maga movement. In the summer of 2016 he secured a meeting at Trump Tower and gave Don Jr advice on how his father could woo young voters. Don Jr was so impressed that he instantly hired Kirk as his personal campaign assistant – or “bag boy”, as Kirk put it – as the pair took fundraising trips across the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kylespencerjournalist.com/\">Kyle Spencer</a>, a journalist and author of Raising Them Right: The Untold Story About America’s Ultraconservative Youth Movement and Its Plot for Power, said: “Don Jr didn’t think much of it until he started hanging out with Charlie and seeing how incredibly driven and ambitious he was, how skilled he was at building alliances with people of all different ages and how comfortable he was, even at a very early age, with people who had a tremendous amount of money and power. He was charming to those people but not intimidated and that was a winning combination.”</p> <p>A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/trump-kirk.html\">the New York Times reported</a>, Kirk was a guest at Don Jr’s birthday party at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump held a private conversation with him for 40 minutes.</p> <p>Spencer, who interviewed Kirk many times, continued: “Trump took a liking to him and that was very genuine. As much as Trump can have a relationship with someone and a fondness for them, he always had a real fondness for Charlie, and part of it was because he and Charlie are very similar.</p> <p>“Charlie had a kind of charismatic infectiousness and ability to draw certain people in a very similar way that Trump had. Charlie also had a real understanding of being at the forefront of media communication methods and that you always had to be a little bit ahead of the curve. Trump understood that too, which is why both of them were so comfortable building followings and communicating online and creating, in Charlie’s case, a lot of online assets.”</p>    <p>Vance said Kirk first made contact with him through a direct message on Twitter (now X) after the future vice-president appeared on Fox News in 2017. They became fast friends. Kirk was one of the first people Vance called when he thought of running for the Senate in early 2021, Vance said. Kirk introduced him to people who eventually ran his campaign – and to Don Jr.</p> <p>Vance, whom Kirk had championed as a potential running mate for Trump, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1965985360606888182\">tweeted this week</a>: “Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind. Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/black-students-colleges-racist-threats\">Black students and colleges across US targeted with racist threats day after Charlie Kirk killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By his own estimate, Kirk visited the White House more than a hundred times during Trump’s first term. In 2020, he published the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAGA-Doctrine-Only-Ideas-Future/dp/1094116238\">The Maga Doctrine</a>, a bestselling book that argued in favour of Christian nationalism and the “America First” agenda.</p> <p>He pushed conspiracy theories popular among white nationalists, including the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/cpac-republicans-democrats-america-trump-biden\"> false claim that the 2020 election was rigged</a> in favour of Joe Biden. His Turning Point Action group sponsored buses to take supporters to Washington ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on 6 January 2021, though Kirk himself did not attend. Two people connected to Turning Point Action, including its chief operating officer, served as fake electors in Arizona as part of Trump’s plot to steal the election.</p> <p>Kirk stuck by Trump during the wilderness years, in which the former president battled four criminal cases, and helped plot his improbable comeback. Turning Point Action was instrumental in driving youth support in last year’s election and was credited by Trump’s campaign for helping deliver the battleground state of Arizona.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/24/steve-bannon-war-room-republican\">Steve Bannon</a>, a godfather of the Maga movement, said by phone from Utah: “People underappreciated this: he changed the ground game. This ballot-chasing initiative was absolutely fundamental to winning in 2024. It will be fundamental going forward. What he did with young people is extraordinary.”</p> <p>Then Kirk played an outsized role in the presidential transition, advising Trump on his staff picks. Bannon, whose War Room podcast was followed by <a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/playlists/show/the-charlie-kirk-show/\">The Charlie Kirk Show</a> each day on the Real America’s Voice platform, said: “In the transition, Charlie basically moved to Mar-a-Lago. He was a central part of the transition.</p> <p>“He was, with Sergio Gor [director of the White House presidential personnel office], doing all the vetting and in a ton of meetings. He was so busy he skipped the show a bunch; I bet you Charlie only did a third of the shows during the Mar-a-Lago transition period. That’s how involved he was in the transition. The president liked having him around and he delivered.”</p> <p>Kirk supported the controversial nomination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/pete-hegseth-what-we-know\">Pete Hegseth</a>, a former Fox News host, as defence secretary. He also made the case for Turning Point USA allies to get government jobs. Bannon believes that Kirk’s “imprint” is felt in the defence, health, homeland security and other government departments.</p> <p>“Folks he didn’t know, he would do vettings. If he had a candidate or somebody he wanted to push, maybe not for a top level job but for second or third tier where the action is, people would go to Charlie. He had very active role and that continued. He spent a lot of time in Washington in the first couple months of the administration.”</p> <p>In January, Kirk travelled to Greenland with Don Jr to promote Trump’s declared ambition to acquire the Arctic territory. More recently he returned to Phoenix, Arizona, to work on Turning Point and prepare for next year’s midterm elections, Bannon added.</p> <p>“If Charlie had wanted a senior position in the government, it was there for the taking. He could have asked for virtually anything – maybe not a cabinet-level position but in a super-important position, either in the White House staff or in any of the department – and Charlie would have gotten what he wanted.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kirk remained in ideological lockstep with Trump and his inner circle, often echoing, amplifying and seeking to normalise their brazen displays of sexism, racism and Islamophobia. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wl3UwsNZ544?si=Y9yn_XXjc4bmQek7\" title=\"\">questioned the qualifications</a> of Black airline pilots, just as Trump had done during an attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p> <p>Jared Holt, a researcher at <a href=\"https://openmeasures.io/\" title=\"\">Open Measures</a>, a company that monitors influence operations online, said: “Kirk was a reliable propagandist who worked to sanitize the most alarming aspects of Trump’s movement. He relentlessly attacked Trump’s critics and demonized his scapegoats – immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities, to name a few.”</p> <p>There have been moments during Trump’s second term when Kirk was reportedly uncomfortable with the president’s decision to bomb Iran and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-response-epstein-files\">refusal to release files</a> on the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. But he was careful to avoid direct criticism of the man who was both political mentor and soulmate.</p> <p>After Kirk’s death this week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” The president ordered flags flown at half-mast and announced he would posthumously award Kirk the Medal of Freedom. Vance escorted Kirk’s body home to Phoenix on Air Force Two.</p> <p>His place in Maga mythology is assured, as his political legacy. <a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There are Turning Point people in the Trump administration and they are directly there because of Kirk’s influence. Charlie Kirk was talking about building a sustainable Maga movement. They’re playing for tomorrow. A lot of people are playing for today.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Watchdog says there are also allegations of discriminatory and misogynistic comments, centring on Charing Cross police station </p>",
    "content": "<p>Nine Scotland Yard officers have been suspended after an investigation was launched into claims of excessive use of force and the making of discriminatory and misogynistic comments.</p> \n<p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the allegations centre on Charing Cross police station in central London, the source of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/met-officers-joked-raping-women-police-watchdog-racist\">previous scandal</a> for the Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>The new investigation concerns 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the station. They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.</p> \n<p>The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”</p> \n<p>The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.</p> \n<p>The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.</p> \n<p>An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.</p> \n<p>The Met’s handling of the scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/met-officer-was-promoted-despite-misconduct-over-sexist-and-racist-messages\">with one officer being promoted</a>, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick.

The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.</p> \n<p>The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.</p> \n<p>“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”</p> \n<p>The Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said: “The behaviour as reported is disgraceful and nine officers were suspended within 24 hours of the allegations being assessed and another two officers have been removed from frontline duties.</p> \n<p>“We are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by professional standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings. The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”</p> \n<p>Twist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”</p> \n<p>The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.</p> \n<p>“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>The drugmaker AstraZeneca has paused a planned £200m expansion of its Cambridge research site, completing a depressing week for the UK pharmaceutical industry.</p> \n<p>The decision by the UK’s largest company means none of its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/astrazeneca-plans-650-million-investment-in-uk\">much-trumpeted £650m investment package in the UK</a> – which was originally announced in March 2024 – is proceeding.</p> \n<p>The now stalled £200m Cambridge project had been expected to create 1,000 jobs. In January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facility</a> in Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.</p> \n<p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”</p> \n<p>The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/astrazeneca-invest-us-trump-tariff-threats\">would invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030</a>, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.</p> \n<p>The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.</p> \n<p>The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country into <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapped a £1bn London research centre</a> as well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.</p> \n<p>Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.</p> \n<p>A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">other big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investing</a> in the UK.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> \n<p>Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">told the Guardian</a> Britain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.</p> \n<p>Sanofi said: “Any substantial inward investment into the UK is currently on pause until we see tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive.”</p> \n<p>Also this week, Eli Lilly, a US drugmaker, said its planned London gateway lab, an incubator space for new drugs that brings together researchers, part of a £279m investment, was on hold.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceutical industry has long argued that the UK needs to spend more on new medicines, bringing the NHS’s outlay on medications more in line with other countries.</p> \n<p>A row between the sector and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, intensified after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">long-running NHS pricing negotiations broke down without an agreement </a>in late August. Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.</p> \n<p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/13/hundreds-baltic-tracking-russia-shadow-fleet-oil-tankers",
    "description": "<p>The Guardian joins the Swedish coastguard to patrol an area that has become a hybrid warfare battleground </p>",
    "content": "<p>In front of a bank of screens on the boat’s bridge, the Swedish<strong> </strong>coastguard Jan Erik Antonsson shows on a live map on a laptop how many vessels of Russia’s “shadow fleet” there are in the area. “These green symbols are the shadow fleet,” he says. More than a dozen green triangles representing shadow fleet vessels pop up around the coastline of southern Sweden alone. </p> \n<p>Every day hundreds of shadow fleet ships – unregulated ageing tankers from around the world in varying states of repair carrying oil from Russia to states including China and India – are moving through a relatively narrow passage in the Baltic.</p> \n<p>What was previously hoped would effectively become “Nato lake” after Finland and Sweden joined Nato, has instead become a battleground for hybrid warfare and the shadow fleet, which move under various identities and change flags to circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Some shadow ships are understood to be accompanied by Russian military vessels, others have planes following their route from above to make sure they get to their intended destination.</p> \n<p>The Guardian was given rare access to the coastguard’s operations, accompanying KBV 003 from the port of Karlskrona on an eight-hour patrol of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.</p> \n<p>“Sea traffic in the Baltic has increased somewhat copiously with the whole shadow fleet, but also with Nato ships, defence ships and the coastguard,” says the vessel’s captain, Joakim Håkansson. “So we try to get far out and show that we’re here.” </p> \n<p>In the Bornholm strait, where shipping traffic is divided like a motorway, shadow fleet vessels pass less than 10 nautical miles off the coast of Sweden. In our vicinity<strong> </strong>off the rocky Blekinge archipelago<strong>,</strong> there are two.</p> \n<p>Later the coastguard follows one, an oil tanker currently flagged in Malta that according to online maritime records has in the last two years also<strong> </strong>been flagged in the Marshall Islands under a different name. As long as vessels are in a country’s economic zone as opposed to its smaller territorial sea – at most 12 nautical miles offshore – the grounds for intervention are extremely limited, but as of July, the coastguard is allowed to contact the vessel to request information about the ship and its insurance. A crew member on the oil tanker says over the radio its last port of call was Primorsk, Russia, and it is carrying just under 30,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Its next stop, he says, is Aliağa in Turkey. Its end destination is impossible to know, but the Swedish coastguard is certain this ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet.</p> \n<p>The radio call is part of a new government plan aimed at tightening checks on the shadow fleet amid fears of a serious oil spill. The vessels are under no obligation to respond, but so far the coastguard says ships have been cooperative.</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of [shadow] ships moving in the Baltic all the time. And it’s a lot for our little sea here,” says Håkansson. “We see ships that have never been seen in the Baltic before that we come across now.” They need to build a picture of how seaworthy the ships are, he says, “because if there was an oil accident with these ships there would be an oil catastrophe in the Baltic”.</p> \n<p>Security in the Baltic has changed dramatically since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says Håkansson. As well as the growing shadow fleet, there is increasing disturbance to satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS, and Baltic authorities must keep a close eye on undersea infrastructure. In the event of an oil spill, the coastguard would be responsible for emergency response and clean-up. There is also a growing physical threat from the Russian military, as its presence has “stepped up” in the Baltic, says Håkansson.</p> \n<p>Håkansson also comes across ships he strongly suspects of spying. “Before they had these research ships [for spying]. Lately they have been using cargo ships to do these operations,” he claims. </p> \n<p>But unless there is evidence of an environmental crime, a fishing crime or some sea traffic crimes, the Swedish coastguard’s ability to act on such threats is extremely limited. According to the rules of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that deals with safety and security of shipping, “the shadow fleet is allowed to move freely in the whole of the Baltics”, says Jonatan Tholin, a preliminary investigation manager for the Swedish coastguard.</p> \n<p>National law can only apply in a country’s territorial waters, in the country’s broader economic zone it is the legislation of the country that the flag is shipped in that counts.</p> \n<p>The problems caused by the shadow fleet are exemplified by Eagle S, an oil tanker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/finland-accuses-tanker-crew-sabotage-undersea-cables-anchor\">suspected of damaging five undersea cables</a> by dragging its anchor between Finland and Estonia in December 2024. Finnish authorities filed charges against members of the crew, arguing that although the measures were carried out outside Finland, the effects of the crime materialised in Finland, meaning it falls into its jurisdiction. The crew members deny the charges.</p> \n<p>However, Tholin believes the most dangerous risk of the shadow fleet is its uninsured vessels, which in the event of an oil spill could have huge financial and environmental costs. “It means it will be taxpayer, the state, who pays,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>It was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.</p> <p>As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jun/21/electric-vehicles-carsick\">Research has shown</a> this is an issue – people who did not usually have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">motion sickness</a> in a conventional car found that they did in EVs.</p> <p>For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.</p> <p>“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.</p> <p>Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.</p> <p>The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22674\">Research carried out in China</a>, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.</p> <p>Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@atiahchayne/video/7531869808762146070\">posted on TikTok</a> about her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.</p> <p>Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”</p> <p>John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.</p> <p>While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.</p> <p>He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014193822500232X\">such as vibrations in the car seat</a> that warn the passenger when the car is turning.</p> <p>Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.</p>    <h2>How to cope with motion sickness</h2> <p>Experts and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/motion-sickness/\">the NHS suggest</a> behavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.</p> <p><strong>Sit at the front</strong> Knowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.</p> <p><strong>Try motion sickness medications</strong> These come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be taken <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html#:~:text=most%20effective%20when%20taken%20before%20exposure\">before travelling</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wear </strong><strong>ac</strong><strong>upressure</strong><strong> bands </strong>These are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,<em>” </em>Golding says.</p> <p><strong>Listen to a 100hz sound</strong> for a minute. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11955832/\">Research</a> from Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.</p>",

    "content": "<p>‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.</p> <p>Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a&nbsp;world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit. The question is: why?</p> <p>John Harrison, 75, is known as the “modern godfather” of autonumerology – the hobby of being enormously into registration plates. He tells me over the phone: “You’ve got people who are mainly interested in what I’d call the pattern of numbers, the more technical side; people interested in personal numbers; people interested in foreign plates. I do a bit of all three.” As a&nbsp;child, like many number-plate fans, he scribbled down the ones he saw on the road and started looking up some of their details. He tracked the work of the late Noel&nbsp;Woodall, the hobby’s true OG, who wrote 24 – yes, 24 – books about registration plates. (One of them is called Where’s It From? When Was It Issued?) Harrison has limited himself to just the one title: The Number Plate Book.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, I meet Harrison face to face at the annual Registration Numbers Club rally at the Wythall Transport Museum in Worcestershire – the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comic-con\">Comic-Con</a> for number-plate fans. They convene there to admire one another’s wares and hand out tongue-in-cheek awards, and have done so for almost 50 years.</p>    <p>I also meet Neal Bircher, who might be more interested in number plates than anyone else on the face of the Earth. He is my introduction to the world of Facebook groups for plate fans, and I join one called Private Number Plate Enthusiasts, which is like a&nbsp;birdspotting group for number-plate devotees. Bircher’s car boasts “NEA 1”, and over the years he has owned various iterations of his initials, “NAB”. He also owns “149 PCE”, the number plate on the truck at the heart of Steven Spielberg’s first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/13/duel-at-50-steven-spielberg-debut-thriller\">Duel</a>. He still yearns for “NB1” or “NA1”, or perhaps “A1”, which enthusiasts tend to consider the great white whale of the plate world. “A1” is perhaps the only plate with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_registration_plate\">own Wikipedia page</a>. It is owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, and would sell for multiple millions.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple millions, at the rally I also meet Richard Conway. I know about Conway because I have heard he is selling the “1 HRH” plate on his Bentley for £2.5m. (He doesn’t throw in the Bentley for that price.) It is a valuation that raises eyebrows everywhere I mention it. “Too much,” Harrison says. “If you’re a&nbsp;multimillionaire, two-and-a-half may be peanuts, but to me it sounds, shall we say, somewhat ambitious.”</p> <p>Angela Banh is marketing manager for Regtransfers, which, as the biggest number-plate broker in the country, advertises some plates for millions of pounds. “F1”, which belongs to car entrepreneur Afzal Kahn, was&nbsp;listed on the website until recently and he expects £15m for it. Does she think “1 HRH” is worth £2.5m? “It’s not one that we would value at that kind of figure,” Banh says. “But that doesn’t mean someone’s not going to pay two-and-a-half for it.”</p>    <p>Conway, 50, is an entrepreneur who also owns the Number Plate Company Group Limited. He won’t tell me how much he paid for “1 HRH”, of course, but in 2009 it changed hands at a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) auction for £92,000 plus VAT and fees. He bought it 13 years later, but hadn’t intended on selling it. Like various other enthusiasts, he likens the hobby to collecting expensive paintings. “I might think: ‘What an idiot. They’ve spent £3m on that piece of art.’ But that’s because I don’t understand the market.” He tells me he has already turned down seven-figure offers. What if King Charles tapped him on the shoulder? “I&nbsp;think that’s unlikely,” he smiles. The reverse plate – “HRH 1”, which those in the business consider the “right” way around because the letters come first – was given to Queen Elizabeth II as an engagement present by the original owner. Conway doesn’t seem likely to give his up for free.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Back in Chichester, the price of lot 56 is still rising: £300,000, £310,000, £320,000. The number plate in question is “JB 1”, once the property of Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealer John&nbsp;Barclay. Why is the plate so valuable? Because “JB” has a good claim to being the most common set of initials in the country. (To help them come to an accurate valuation, Regtransfers has a database of names and surnames.) “330,” says the auctioneer. “340 … ” One of the bidders in the room is John Doherty, buy-in manager for Regtransfers, sitting with Banh. He has just bid £350,000. There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people.</p> <p>In 2019, when the DVLA surveyed drivers with an interest in private number plates, they found that 6% wanted them for their business; 17% considered them an investment; and 69% bought them because of a&nbsp;personal connection. The perception of people who go in for personalised number plates isn’t famously positive. Of&nbsp;course, hardcore hobbyists demur, making the point that being really into number plates doesn’t <em>necessarily </em>make you an overcompensating flash prat. “It’s not about ‘Me, me, me – look at me,’” Bircher says. “It’s ‘I find this interesting.’ I say to people, ‘What on earth is showy about the squiggles on the plate on the front of your car?’”</p> <p>One noticeable thing about the enthusiasts is that they tend to be older, white and male. But bucking one of those trends is 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/numberplatehistory/?hl=en\">Kit Joubert</a>, who is making a splash on Instagram with an account devoted to exploring the history of number plates. He presents slick videos in which he discusses notorious plates, always with access to the cars they are on. Joubert thinks that over the last couple of decades the public perception has changed significantly, to the point that a personalised number plate is now simply another part of car customisation. “There’s a shift beginning to happen,” he says, “and I, for better or worse, might be the face of that, at least on social media.” Because there is often an overlap between fast cars and lucrative number plates, the hobby is well suited to visual platforms such as Instagram. Joubert recently organised a meet-up for plate enthusiasts, which he claims was the first to happen without the involvement of the Registration Numbers Club. He wants to make number plates his full-time job in the next year. “It’s changed my life,” he says.</p>    <p>Number plates were introduced to British roads under the 1903 Motor Car Act and, as Harrison explains in his book, at first they were one or two letters (denoting an area of the country), followed by up to four numbers. Harrison believes the first to have been a Hastings plate, “DY 1”. (The letters correlated to the size of the local authority. London, the largest, had “A”. Once the end of the alphabet was reached, “AA” took effect.) After the numbers were used up, letters were added before the two initials. Then, in the 1950s, the reversed format was phased in: “1234 AB”. In the 60s, letters were added to the end, with the “A” suffix in “AMP 595A” denoting 1963, for example. From the 1980s things got increasingly convoluted – one of the many reasons that people yearn for the beautiful simplicity of those early plates.</p> <p>Another explanation for the popularity of plates today is that the DVLA has cottoned on to how much of a cash cow the hobby is. In 1977 the government was plotting to make the transfer of plates more expensive and difficult. “No one could make a convincing claim that he would suffer genuine hardship if he could no longer afford to transfer his cherished mark or his personalised number plate,” <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1977-01-24/debates/0fec342e-5409-4742-8b16-fa86f457252a/RoadVehicles(RegistrationMarkTransfers)\">said the MP John Horam</a>. The Registration Numbers Club formed in opposition to this philosophy, and ultimately won the fight. Now, the DVLA would never seek to make the process more difficult: the DVLA’s head of external communications points me to an <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687e00805f0f5104b9806beb/DVLA_annual_report_and_accounts_2024_to_2025.pdf\">annual report</a> that says in 2024-25 they made more than £274m from personalised number plates. (The organisation charges an £80 fee for every plate sold.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if ‘OAS 1S’ might go for a silly amount. The DVLA are no fools when it comes to the timing of their release</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The DVLA held its first auction in 1989. Initially, it&nbsp;simply sold plates that had already been issued. Over time, however, it has become possible to request&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific plate be created and auctioned. If it is valid and unreleased, it could be yours. Once upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, all of the DVLA’s auctions were in-person, but when attendance fell during the pandemic, it moved&nbsp;them all to its website. In June, I register to check one out.</p> <p>I am interested in this specific auction because I want to know if “OAS 1S” might go for a silly amount of money. (The DVLA is no fool when it comes to the timing of its releases.) Also up for grabs is “95 A”, which Bircher tells me is the first three-character plate to be auctioned in five years. As I watch, I can see the prices rise in real time. At the end of the five-day auction, “OAS 1S” is at £56,040; “95 A” has secured £71,010; but the winner is “8 FU”, which has sold for £90,000. Harrison’s insight is that “Fu” is a common surname in China, where the number eight is also considered lucky.</p>    <p>“FU” brings us to another subject: <a href=\"https://www.regtransfers.co.uk/content/hundreds-2025-plates-banned\">naughty plates</a>. Banh tells me that until 2024, “FU” was suppressed (because of its “fuck you” connotations). As Harrison says in his book, censorship has been a concern since the very beginning. “DD” was originally considered too problematic to have on a car because the initials stood for “drop dead”. When local authorities were allocated two-letter prefixes, Dorset were disgruntled with “BF” because it was considered to stand for “bloody fool”; “666” used to be deemed too offensive for sensitive eyes. “They go around in circles,” Banh says. “What was considered rude many years ago is no longer rude now.” Currently you can have a “PEN 15” but you can’t have an “AR25 HOL”.</p> <p>At the rally I meet Matthew Edwards, 56, who is selling his “S69 CUM” plate for £15,000. (His wife no longer finds it funny.) For a while he also had “K21 KKK” – until the DVLA decided “KKK” was too offensive to be allowed on the road. He had bought it purely to sell it, but that became all but impossible. “I couldn’t give it away,” he says.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in Chichester, “JB 1” has broken the £400,000 barrier. Everyone but Doherty and a&nbsp;mysterious bidder on the phone has dropped out. The bidding goes up to £410,000, then £420,000, then £430,000. When it creeps up to £500,000, an audible murmur goes around the room. The record is within touching distance.</p> <p>“Is it any different from adorning your car with anything else – to having a special paint job, or having some bolt-on goodie? I don’t know,” says Nicholas Young, 76, as I sit in his Rolls-Royce (number plate “NY 1”). Young, whose fascination lies in the history of number plates, concedes that it is “childish and stupid” to buy plates because they match your initials. He also admits that’s exactly what he’s done.</p> <p>Young has also written his own book – the colossal Car Number Classics (“I was impressed not only by its weight, but certainly more by its contents!” one of the reviewers said) – and he has no interest in treating the plates as a way to get rich. “If I say I christened my son after a number plate, that really does sound sad,” he says, “but his name is the same as mine. So they’ll go to him.”</p>    <p>In Chichester, the anonymous bidder on the phone is head-to-head with Doherty. They’re at £500,000. “510,” the auctioneer says. He looks at Doherty, who nods. “520,” he says. With that, it has broken the UK record. Joubert, who is standing feet away from me, is well aware of this. “530,” the auctioneer says, taking a bid from the phone. There is a silence. “530,” he repeats, looking at Doherty. He shakes his head. As the auctioneer raises his hammer, fireworks crash somewhere above our heads. “530,000,” he says, banging his hammer. The room breaks out into applause. It is an astonishing turn of events. With the addition of fees and VAT, “JB&nbsp;1” has sold for £608,600. Is it simply three squiggles on a&nbsp;sheet of metal? Or is it a priceless piece of history? As&nbsp;Edwards says: “You either get it or you don’t.”</p> <p>Who is the mysterious new owner of “JB 1”? Weeks later, I hear back from the auctioneer who had the bidder on the other end of the phone. I wanted to know if they might be willing to speak to me. “I spoke to the buyer,” he says. Yes? “And I can confirm they would like to remain anonymous.” Damn. “However, they are fine to say that they have the initials JB.” Justin&nbsp;Bieber? Joe&nbsp;Biden? Jeff&nbsp;Bezos? Jack Black? James Blunt? Juliette Binoche, perhaps? I have chosen to believe it was Jim&nbsp;Broadbent. But we may never know. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The American dream has never looked more seductive, with long and loose summer wardrobes and beachy jewellery</p>",
    "content": "<p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p> <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p> <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p> <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this New York fashion week, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p> <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p> <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p> <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before New York fashion week began.</p> <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p> <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>  ",

They moved in a tight, repeated loop, and on this day the light was soft and just right to capture their movement clearly,” he says.

He&nbsp;notes a “kind of visual poetry and a&nbsp;reminder that wonder can be found in quiet, overlooked places. These birds have adapted to concrete spaces we have built over their habitats, yet&nbsp;they continue to move through the city with elegance and ease.”</p>",

Gherkins also happen to be one of my favourite foods, though I usually eat them straight from the jar and rarely save any for all those recipes that benefit from their addition, from potato salads to bloody marys.</p> <p>I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p> <p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed? </p> <p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

Less crunchy and more watery than most, but still good value for a straightforward pickle.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Morrisons whole gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/morrisons-whole-gherkins-680g/105096328\" > £1.40 for 680g at Morrisons (21p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small and knobbly, with a sweet aroma. The flavour also opens with sweetness, moves into a gentle sourness, then a touch of mustard. While there’s nothing to complain about, these don’t offer much in the way of complexity or interest, but, that said, they’re nicely crunchy. A solid, good-value option.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Epicure whole pickles with dill and red pepper</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/309766369\" > £3.75 for 970g at Tesco (39p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/epicure-original-whole-pickles/587054011\" > £3.75 for 970g at Ocado (39p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized gherkin with a juniper-green hue. Balanced, sweet-sour flavour with strong savoury notes of onion and red pepper, and not over salty. The crunch is OK, but not excellent. Contains “flavourings”. This product won two Great Taste stars in 2022, so perhaps the recipe has changed since?</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Mrs Elswood haimisha gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers-670g\" > £2.50 for 670g at Sainsbury’s (37p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers/034470-17297-17298\" > £2.90 for 670g at Waitrose (43p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized, bendy “wally” (as my London-born stepdad used to say) with a golden olive hue. The flavour is dominated by salt, which overwhelms any nuance aside from lingering dill and onion notes. The crunch is decent, though. Mrs Elswood is a heritage brand, <a href=\"https://www.mrselswood.com/about#:~:text=CONTACT-,SINCE%201947,-The%20story%20of\">founded in 1947</a>, that shows more consideration for sustainability than some. Uses additives, though, which detracts from the overall appeal.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Sainsbury’s pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-pickled-gherkins-340g-7863266-p-44\" > £1.35 for 340g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g) </a>  <p>★☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A cocktail-sized, mossy-hued green gherkin. Has a soupy and quite sweet preserved aroma, with strong capsicum and onion notes. Unfortunately, the spirit vinegar hits harshly at the back of the throat. The crunch is very good, though. These contain sulphites, which are unnecessary additives of potential concern, especially when simpler recipes are tastier.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dawtona pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/pickled-onions-vegetables/dawtona-gherkins-pickled-cucumbers-in-vinegar-brine-with-spices-900-g/9105186\" > £1.94 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/262299348\" > £2.90 for 900g at Tesco (32p/100g) </a>  <p>☆☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A decent-sized snozzcumber (as Roald Dahl’s BFG might say), ranging in colour from dark army-green to iridescent yellow chartreuse, but, sadly, I think I had a spoiled jar. There’s a slight saltiness, but it’s overshadowed by a stale flavour that’s hard to ignore, plus the texture is softer and moister than you’d expect. As a result, these are disqualified – sorry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Buttons\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

The Emmys are back, more or less kicking off the Hollywood award season with a healthy mix of Emmy stalwarts and beloved newbies. Will voters choose between the head (Severance, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/15/emmy-nominations-2025\">leading 27 noms</a>) or the heart (The Pitt) for best drama?

Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/business/media/severance-the-pitt-emmys.html\">current state of the television business</a>. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Severance</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Andor</p> <h2><strong>Best comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Abbott Elementary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/26/the-bear-season-four-review-finally-becoming-the-show-it-was-always-destined-to-be\">The Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/11/hacks-season-four-review-the-return-of-this-extremely-funny-hugely-raw-comedy-is-a-sheer-pleasure\">Hacks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/27/only-murders-in-the-building-season-four-review-by-far-the-funniest-thing-on-tv\">Only Murders in the Building</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/shrinking-season-two-review-harrison-ford-comedy-apple-tv\">Shrinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/26/the-studio-review-seth-rogens-hollywood-satire-is-fast-furious-and-beautifully-fun\">The Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny\">What We Do in the Shadows</a></p> <p>Another interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Studio</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Hacks</p> <h2><strong>Best limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/17/adolescence-netflix-powerful-tv-could-save-lives\">Adolescence</a>, Black Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv\">Dying for Sex</a>, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Penguin</p> <p>Of all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/09/france-netflix-uk-drama-adolescence-teach-toxic-masculinity-schools\">fixture in secondary school programs</a> across Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">thematic lightning rod</a>, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a drama series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pedro-pascal\">Pedro Pascal</a> (The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)</p> <p>It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)</p> <p>Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)</p> <p>If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into the Emmys with 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Seth Rogen</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adam Brody</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a comedy series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)</p> <p>Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win. Smart has won thrice previously for her late career-defining role as the brittle, brassy comedian Deborah Vance. There’s no reason why she shouldn’t continue her streak for Hacks’ fourth season, for her portrait of just how awful it can be – how vengeful, vicious and wounded one can become – when they get everything they wanted.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence), Jake Gyllenhaal (Presumed Innocent), Brian Tyree Henry (Dope Thief), Cooper Koch (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story)</p> <p>This one is a toss-up, with strong performances across the board, and it’s nice to see the always excellent Brian Tyree Henry get a nod for Dope Thief, one of many Apple TV series that, like Gyllenhaal’s Presumed Innocent, disappear into the streaming ether soon after release. Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario. But Colin Farrell, who won the Golden Globe and SAG awards earlier this year for his full vanity disappearance in The Penguin, may have the edge here.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Colin Farrell</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Stephen Graham</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Cate Blanchett (Disclaimer), Meghann Fahy (Sirens), Rashida Jones (Black Mirror), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin), Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)</p> <p>Look, Cate Blanchett is, indisputably, one of the best actors of her generation, but the muddled Apple TV show Disclaimer is not a worthy showcase of her talents. In a similar vein, I want awards for Meghann Fahy, who was the deceptively nuanced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/13/white-lotus-daphne-sullivan-character-meghann-fahy\">true star of the White Lotus’s second season</a>, but Netflix’s Sirens was outright bad, and her performance in it iffy. Cristin Milioti is delivering career-best work in the Penguin, but voter preference will skew toward the perennially nominated Michelle Williams, whose performance in Dying for Sex is up to her very high standards – spiky, layered, vulnerable and totally convincing.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <h2><strong>Scripted variety series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a></p> <p>I maintain that it is not fair to pit the thoroughly researched, impeccably delivered deep dives of Last Week Tonight against the deliberately loose sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live. I also maintain that Last Week Tonight is a singular television program whose constant drive to be better, to cut through bullshit, to be more empathetic and reasonable, deserves a 10th consecutive Emmy.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Last Week Tonight</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Last Week Tonight</p> <h2><strong>Talk series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>The Daily Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a></p> <p>As someone who watches every late-night monologue every morning for work, I personally think the Daily Show – Jon Stewart plus a rotating cast of five correspondent-hosts (Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Michael Kosta, Ronny Chieng and Josh Johnson) – is doing the best work at processing the day’s headlines in a way that is both informative and funny, with the appropriate amount of seriousness and cynicism. But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>The Daily Show</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)</p> <p>Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast. Tillman deserves for his unnerving and unforgettable performance as a corporate henchman, but I bet voters prefer Goggins’s especially miserable tourist.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Walton Goggins</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Tramell Tillman</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Patricia Arquette (Severance), Carrie Coon (The White Lotus), Katherine LaNasa (The Pitt), Julianne Nicholson (Paradise), Parker Posey (The White Lotus), Natasha Rothwell (The White Lotus), Aimee Lou Wood (The White Lotus)</p> <p>Another, more exciting White Lotus-off! I would’ve liked to see Leslie Bibb nominated as well for her pitch-perfect portrayal of a secret Texas Republican, or for Katherine LaNasa to get more attention for her radiant calm on the Pitt. But this is a heavyweight supporting category between Aimee Lou Wood’s deceptively difficult work, Parker Posey’s North Carolina accent and Carrie Coon’s magnificent portrayal of feral love and jealousy in a friend triangle.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Carrie Coon</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Aimee Lou Wood</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong><strong> </strong>Ike Barinholtz (The Studio), Colman Domingo (The Four Seasons), Harrison Ford (Shrinking), Jeff Hiller (Somebody Somewhere), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Michael Urie (Shrinking), Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live)</p> <p>The recognition of Jeff Hiller’s heartfelt and genuinely funny work on the under-sung Somebody Somewhere is a classic case of the nomination is the win. There’s a lot of love for Ike Barinholtz’s physical comedy as a coke-addled exec in The Studio, and residual affection for Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s beloved Cousin Richie on the Bear, but it’s hard to beat the narrative of national treasure Harrison Ford getting his first Emmy nomination at age 83.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Harrison Ford</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Jeff Hiller</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actress in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong><strong> </strong>Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Kathryn Hahn (The Studio), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Catherine O’Hara (The Studio), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary), Jessica Williams (Shrinking)</p> <p>The Bear’s Liza Colón-Zayas won last year, likely because her standout episode in the Bear’s third season, Napkins, aired in June and was fresh in Emmy voters minds. Because of Emmy timing, she’s up for that deserving episode now, but the tide has shifted against the Bear. Hannah Einbinder has yet to win for her yin to Jean Smart’s yang on Hacks, and this is her year.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Hannah Einbinder</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Liza Colón-Zayas</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Javier Bardem (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), Bill Camp (Presumed Innocent), Owen Cooper (Adolescence), Rob Delaney (Dying For Sex), Peter Sarsgaard (Presumed Innocent), Ashley Walters (Adolescence)</p> <p>This is another tight lock – the power of Adolescence as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">“wake-up call”</a> on the influence of online misogyny on young boys does not work if the actor playing the boy doesn’t invoke both revulsion and empathy.

    "description": "<p>Will Canelo’s power or Crawford’s precision prove the decisive factor in Saturday night’s showdown in Las Vegas? Our writers set out the arguments on both sides</p>",
    "content": "<h2>Why Terence Crawford will beat Canelo Álvarez</h2> \n<p>For years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/terence-crawford\">Bud Crawford</a>’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so complete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/30/terence-crawford-after-spence-win-im-pound-for-pound-no-1-without-a-doubt\">it cemented his place</a> in boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/terence-crawford-profile-canelo-alvarez-fight\">Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a5ca207-01c6-4e22-8a75-8e43030f4b13\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\"><b>Canelo v Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's happening?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where and when is the fight?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators.

Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\">Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.</p> \n<p>Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-how-boxing-won-the-lottery-but-lost-the-ticket-again\">present company included</a>. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.</p> \n<p>The weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.</p> \n<p>The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Why Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence Crawford</h2> \n<p>Next month it will be 20 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez\">Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez</a> made his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.</p> \n<p>Years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/saul-canelo-alvarez-i-want-to-keep-fighting-my-whole-life-i-so-enjoy-it\">he confided</a> that “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”</p> \n<p>Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The great Terence Crawford is, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/alvarez-and-crawford-face-off-in-breathless-blockbuster-destined-to-break-records\">Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break records</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-boxing-fight-arlington-texas-report-result\">sharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tyson</a> in 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.</p> \n<p>Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.</p> \n<p>Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.</p> \n<p>This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.</p> \n<p>Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/04/terence-crawford-beats-israil-madrimov-to-become-four-division-champion\">looked diminished against Israil Madrimov</a> – who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.</p> \n<p>Álvarez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/04/canelo-alvarez-terence-crawford-william-scull-fight\">looked terrible in his last fight</a>, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/11/jaron-boots-ennis-eimantas-stanionis-fight-preview\">Jaron “Boots” Ennis</a>, who would test Crawford at welterweight.</p> \n<p>Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez\">he was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013</a>, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.</p> \n<p>But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.</p> \n<p>Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Priestdaddy author on quitting social media, Maga conspiracies and how her second novel grew out of a period of post-Covid mania</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patricia-lockwood\">Patricia Lockwood</a> does whenever she spots a priest while walking through an airport. The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like: <em>I know</em>.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.</p> <p>This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-gilbert\">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> than a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.</p> <p>So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”</p> <p>All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experienced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”</p> <p>I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.</p> <p>The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”</p>    <p>As I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”</p> <p>These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked about <em>cancel culture</em>. It is my greatest fear, to be asked about <em>cancel culture</em> – or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I&nbsp;will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”</p> <p>This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very&nbsp;exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.</p> <p>Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/26/patricia-lockwood-poem-rape-joke\">Rape Joke</a>, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.</p> <p>In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born with <a href=\"https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/proteus-syndrome/\">Proteus syndrome</a>, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”</p>    <p>In the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.</p> <p>Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”</p> <p>Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”</p> <p>The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”</p> <p>On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”</p> <p><em>• Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

    "content": "<p>Is it still safe to stage the World Cup in the United States? After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.</p> <p>The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/florian-wirtz-liverpool-newcastle-nick-woltemade-gambling-philipp-lahm\">Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp Lahm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friend Donald Trump.</p> <p>Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar\">I feel like a concerned black African football tourist</a>. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.</p> <p>You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.</p> <p>But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.</p> <p>It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.</p>    <p>And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.</p> <p>This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/01/cristiano-ronaldo-faces-us1bn-lawsuit-for-promoting-binance-nfts\">collapsed into legal chaos</a>, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.</p> <p>What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.</p> <p>Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/04/us-court-to-hear-arguments-over-payment-in-cristiano-ronaldo-allegation-case\">no-admission no-guilt payoff</a> to make the whole thing stop.</p> <p>The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.</p>    <p>And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.</p> <p>Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).</p> <p>And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.</p> <p>For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.</p> <p>Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.</p> <p>He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.</p>    <p>For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.</p> <p>Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.</p> <p>What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.</p> <p>This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.</p> <p>Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn’t been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.</p> <p>There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America’s public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the Guardian University Guide 2026. It can feel like it’s all change in universities these days – exams are increasingly a thing of the past, you can tune into lectures online, and now there’s the tricky business of working out whether ChatGPT is your studying friend or foe.</p> <p>This year’s guide will help you understand how technology is reshaping the university experience, and how to make the most of it – from landing a place on a course you love, to getting ready for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>The Guardian rankings will help you figure out which universities give their students the best experience, rather than just showing you which are strongest in academic research, like most other league tables.</p> <p>We rank universities through eight different scores, which form a total out of 100. These include what students say about their teaching and feedback in the annual National Student Survey.</p> <p>We also look at how big class sizes are through the student-to-staff ratio and how much universities spend on teaching each student. Other areas covered are students’ A-level grades and whether their academic performance improves at university (the value-added score), and how likely they are to persevere with their course. There’s also data on how many students get graduate jobs 15 months after leaving university. For each metric, we use the most recent data available at the time of publication. Any blank spaces mean there is data missing, so we focus on the other measures.</p> <p>In the guide, you will find our overall league table of UK universities as well as individual subject profiles and tables. This year, we have a special table showing you the universities and courses that graduates were least likely to regret. We’ve also got lots of advice to help you make up your mind and start planning for university, from how to take advantage of clearing to which universities offer a buzzing student nightlife.</p> <p>The rankings change annually, and some universities may benefit from temporary measures such as funding boosts or changes to their student intake. Don’t forget that universities languishing at the bottom of the overall table can be top for certain subjects – so check out our subject tables and profiles to build up a full picture.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Exclusive: A third of those polled do not tell bosses about use of tools and half think AI threatens the social structure</p>",
    "content": "<p>It is the work shortcut that dare not speak its name. A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.</p> <p>Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.</p> <p>Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.</p> <p>The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.</p> <p>Next week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess\">state visit to the UK</a> by Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.</p> <p>The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/dhanushi-lost-her-job-the-same-day-cba-rolled-out-an-ai-chatbot-it-may-just-be-the-beginning\">‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743\">has said</a> he wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p> <p>The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01901-x\">US study</a> circulated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.</p> <p>Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.</p> <p>“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”</p> <p>A study by the Henley Business School in May found 49% of workers reported there were no formal guidelines for AI use in their workplace and more than a quarter felt their employer did not offer enough support.</p> <p>Prof Keiichi Nakata at the school said people were more comfortable about being transparent in their use of AI than 12 months earlier but “there are still some elements of AI shaming and some stigma associated with AI”.</p> <p>He said: “Psychologically, if you are confident with your work and your expertise you can confidently talk about your engagement with AI, whereas if you feel it might be doing a better job than you are or you feel that you will be judged as not good enough or worse than AI, you might try to hide that or avoid talking about it.”</p> <p>OpenAI’s head of solutions engineering for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Matt Weaver, said: “We’re seeing huge demand from business leaders for company-wide AI rollouts – because they know using AI well isn’t a shortcut, it’s a skill. Leaders see the gains in productivity and knowledge sharing and want to make that available to everyone.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mille Colling and Emma Aalto given go-ahead to compete in qualifier for national championships next month</p>",
    "content": "<p>A British ice dancer and her skating partner are to become Finland’s first same-sex team to take part in a competition after a rule change by the country’s skating federation.</p> <p>Millie Colling, 20, who was born in Gateshead and moved to Finland at the age of six, and Emma Aalto, 19, will compete in a qualifier for the national championships next month after pressing for an amendment to the rules to allow them to enter as a team.</p> <p>The pair said they were “best friends that want to skate together”. Their request was supported by their coach, Neil Brown, who helped persuade the skating federation to agree new rules, referring to ice dance partners as Skater A and Skater B instead of man and woman.</p> <p>Colling, an art student, enrolled at skating school a year after her family moved to Finland, and Aalto, a fashion student, has been skating since she was five years old. They met two years ago.</p> <p>“We were immediately on the same level, we really clicked,” said Colling. They began to skate together but “at that point we hadn’t seen any other same-gender skating teams”.</p> <p>But this year, the retired Olympic champions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/papadakis-hubbell-skate-together-promote-same-sex-pairs-competition-2025-02-06/\">Madison Hubbell and Gabriella Papadakis performed together</a>, hoping to help break gender stereotypes in the sport. Colling said: “It was completely new and we were, whoa, OK.”</p>    <p>It was a “common misconception” that same-sex teams were gay or in a relationship, she added. “There are lots of queer athletes, and we really admire them. But it’s not the case that in order to be in a non-traditional team you have to be queer.”</p> <p>Aalto said: “The point is to be opening possibilities for everyone, not just for queer people.” Ice dancing with a same-sex partner was “not necessarily any different”, she said.</p> <p>Colling added: “One of us leads, one follows, one lifts, one of us is lifted. We have quite similar body mass, so technically there are some differences, but we still do the same content.”</p> <p>“Every partnership is different,” said Aalto. “Every couple has their own strengths and weaknesses, and their programmes are built around those strengths and weaknesses. Ice dance is a really individual sport – each couple is unique, and we’re just another unique couple.”</p> <p>If the duo qualify, they would be unable to take part in the national competition in December, as that requires further changes. “The federation has said we can’t do it yet – but fingers crossed for the future,” Colling said.</p> <p>The pair hope their participation in the qualifier will be a strong signal of change to the ice dance community and the public. They do not expect to win – “we’re just excited to get out there”, Colling said.</p> <p>They said they felt free and happy while skating. “You stop being a normal version of yourself. You can be whatever you want on the ice,” Aalto said. “It’s the best feeling – it feels like home.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 28-year-old man has been charged with arson after a fire wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said Joshua Oliver had been charged after the blaze at the offices of the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, which broke out in the early hours of Thursday.</p> <p>The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases and an NHS mental health service for veterans, which were based in the same building.</p> <p>Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Christopher Atkinson, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Joshua Oliver with arson following a police investigation into a fire at the offices of Sharon Hodgson MP.</p> <p>“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with Northumbria police as they carried out their investigation.”</p> <p>Oliver, of no fixed address, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Saturday. The CPS urged people not to share information online that could prejudice the legal proceedings.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. After the fire, a spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p>",

Three men at a nearby table were also injured.</p> <p>Javon Riley, 33, from Tottenham, north London, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/18/javon-riley-man-found-guilty-for-role-in-east-london-shooting-of-nine-year-old-girl-evin-restaurant-dalston\">found guilty last month at the Old Bailey</a> of causing grievous harm with intent to the girl and attempting to murder Mustafa Kiziltan, 35, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Nasser Ali, 44.</p> <p>Sentencing Riley on Friday, Judge Lucraft KC said the shooting was part of a dispute between two rival gangs, the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks.</p> <p>He said: “Over the last 10 years, this ongoing feud has seen a series of tit-for-tat murders and attempted murders in London and overseas.</p> <p>“In this case, your acts, and those of the others involved, mean that a nine-year-old girl and her family will have to cope with the life-changing injuries she has sustained through the mindless violence of you and others.”</p> <p>The three men who were shot were said to be affiliated with the Hackney Turks, which had a rivalry with the Tottenham Turks, with whom Riley had links, jurors had heard.</p> <p>The gunman remains at large but prosecutors said Riley had played a “key role” before, during and after the shooting.</p> <p>Riley carried out reconnaissance of the restaurant before the attack, scouted for potential targets and drove the gunman away in a stolen car, which was later burned out.</p> <p>The nine-year-old girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, spent three months in hospital and will suffer lifelong physical and cognitive problems as the bullet remains lodged in her brain.</p> <p>The three male victims received gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and thigh.</p> <p>A victim impact statement from the girl’s mother, read to the court by the judge on Friday, said the family had moved to the UK to seek a “brighter future” for their daughter, who loved gymnastics and playing the guitar.</p> <p>The statement said: “Our daughter’s joyful spirit remains, but it is now wrapped in layers of frustration and silent pain. She watches her friends do what she cannot and she carries it all inside with quiet strength.</p> <p>“This tragedy did not just change our daughter’s life, it broke something in us as a family. Every time we see her struggle, we ask ourselves why we came here and what we could have done differently. The guilt and helplessness are unbearable. For us, the trauma is relentless.</p> <p>“We live with constant fear about the future, unsure of how much more she will lose as she grows. We grieve for the dreams we once had for her: dreams of music, sport and a carefree childhood, all replaced by therapy sessions, hospital appointments and adaptions for survival.”</p> <p>She said the family was doing everything possible to show the girl that her life was “still full of possibilities” and to “make her smile”. “But the mental and emotional trauma we carry every day is heavy, a constant fear for her future and a constant grief for the life she lost and the life we imagined as a family,” she added.</p> <p>During a three-week trial, Riley was asked to identify the “third party” who had recruited him for about £40,000. He refused, citing fear for his life and for his family.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has offered up to £15,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person who fired the shots.</p> <p>DCI Joanna Yorke, who led the investigation, said: “The dangerous man responsible for pulling the trigger is walking free, and it is imperative we find him. People out there know what happened and are choosing to stay quiet. We understand that you may be worried about talking to us, but it is vital we hear from anyone who can assist this investigation.</p> <p>“Please reconsider your decision to stay silent and share what you know. Anything you say will be treated with the utmost care and confidentiality and you will be playing a huge part in securing justice for a young girl and her family.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Group opposing the proscription announces ‘major escalation’ that will culminate in London on 4 October</p>",
    "content": "<p>A<strong> </strong>week of mass actions protesting against the ban on Palestine Action has been announced, beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool and culminating in a national mobilisation in Parliament Square in London on 4 October.</p> <p>The plans were announced by Defend Our Juries on Friday, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">857 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act</a> at a demonstration outside parliament opposing the proscription. It said the next phase of the protests represented a “major escalation” that would create an “unprecedented challenge” for the police, with 1,100 people already registered to take part and risk arrest.</p> <p>“There should be no confusion about where the blame lies: it sits squarely with the government for pursuing this authoritarian ban, plunging an overstretched police force and court and prison systems which are already in crisis, into further chaos,” a spokesperson said. “The power lies with the new home secretary to end this farce by listening to MPs, lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/yvette-cooper-plan-ban-palestine-action-un-experts-lawyers\">UN experts, legal professionals</a>, human rights advocates – and the majority of her own party’s members – and lift this dangerous, anti-democratic ban.”</p> <p>They accused the prime minister, Keir Starmer, of “grotesque double standards” for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/04/israel-president-visit-london-talks-ministers-isaac-herzog\">meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, this week</a>, while people had been arrested for holding cardboard signs in support of Palestine Action. They said it made people “even more determined to do whatever it takes to overturn this unjust ban, including by targeting Starmer’s upcoming conference”.</p> <p>Protests at the party conference, which begins on 28 September, will be an unwelcome distraction for the prime minister as he attempts to address Labour’s slump in the polls.</p> <p>Defend Our Juries launched a new call for people across the country to show their defiance by placing a sign saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” – the same wording people have brandished on placards at the demonstrations – in their front windows. It follows a viral video of a former Labour councillor, Keith Hackett, being <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/4e7ddf31-b481-4179-81f6-5af95e1633ff\">told by police</a> he could legally display a poster in support of Palestine Action because it was “not in public”.</p> <p>Last Saturday’s demonstration was the second major protest organised by Defend Our Juries in defiance of the ban. Defend Our Juries claimed there were 1,500 people holding signs saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” and that the police’s failure to arrest everyone showed they were overwhelmed.</p> <p>At the previous demonstration, last month, 532 people were arrested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/10/police-arrest-hundreds-london-protest-over-palestine-action-ban\">half of whom were aged 60 or above</a>. A spokesperson claimed opposition to the ban, the first of a direct action protest group, was “growing at an exponential rate”.</p> <p>The then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/yvette-cooper-vows-ban-palestine-action-anti-terrorism-laws\">announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action</a> in June, three days after it claimed responsibility for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, although it later emerged that she was advised to proscribe the group in March. She said the group, which targeted organisations it claimed were complicit in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians, had a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and was a threat to national security.</p> <p>Since the ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails\">came into force on 5 July</a>, more than 1,600 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, including vicars, priests, doctors, former government advisers, army veterans, and many elderly and disabled people. The figure is more than were previously arrested during the entire “war on terror” <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-tact-2000-to-june-2025/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-and-subsequent-legislation-arrests-outcomes-and-stop-and-search-great-britain-quarterly-u\">since 2001</a>.</p> <p>Most have not been charged, although seven people appeared in court last week accused of being organisers of the demonstrations.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Trades Union Congress annual congress unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to repeal the proscription of Palestine Action.</p> <p>The president of the civil servants’ union said the ban represented a “significant abuse of counter-terrorist powers and a direct attack on our right to protest against the genocidal Israeli regime”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dale Vince wants ministers to ‘optimise’ resources in fossil fuel basin to help smooth transition to renewables</p>",
    "content": "<p>One of Britain’s leading green industrialists has called on the government to offer subsidies to North Sea oil companies to help support a “just transition” to renewables that protects energy industry workers.</p> <p>Dale Vince, a Labour donor, urged ministers to “optimise” the remaining resources of the declining oil basin as the UK reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">banned new North Sea oil and gas projects</a>.</p> <p>The founder of Ecotricity spoke out a week after his fellow green entrepreneur Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/27/octopus-energy-founder-greg-jackson-given-cabinet-office-role-to-help-shape-future-policies\">a Cabinet Office adviser</a>, backed calls to restart North Sea drilling.</p> <p>The Labour party swept to power in 2024 with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">halt new drilling licences in the North Sea</a>, and it plans to keep the windfall tax imposed during rocketing oil and gas prices in place until 2030.</p> <p>Vince said the government should scrap the windfall tax and instead offer subsidies to oil companies that guarantee a minimum price for the barrels of oil and gas they produce.</p> <p>“Our North Sea is in decline, let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left,” he said. “It’s time for Labour to put its arms around the North Sea and support operators with existing licences. Putting fossil fuels on an equal footing with renewables by giving them a stable price is the key to a just transition.”</p>    <p>Offshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea industry, declined to comment on whether Vince’s proposals would be welcomed by oil and gas companies. A government spokesperson said the proposal was “not under consideration. We are driving forward our mission to become a clean energy superpower, to cut bills for good.”</p> <p>They added: “We are delivering a fair and orderly transition in the North Sea to drive growth and secure tens of thousands of skilled jobs, with the biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first-of-a-kind carbon capture and storage clusters.”</p> <p>Jackson said last week that relying on North Sea oil and gas would have a smaller climate impact than relying on costly imports from the US and the Middle East, which release more emissions during production and transportation than homegrown fossil fuels.</p> <p>“When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas,” Jackson told the Telegraph. “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”</p> <p>The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there needed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist#:~:text=Fatih%20Birol%2C%20the%20IEA's%20executive,now%20%E2%80%93%20from%20this%20year.%E2%80%9D\">no new fossil fuel projects</a> if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>However, the global energy watchdog later clarified that continued investment in existing oil and gas supply would be “essential” in a net zero scenario to ensure that oil and gas supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand.</p> <p>The green industry leaders’ comments on the North Sea come amid growing pressure from opposition parties to back the industry, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">supports about 130,000 jobs</a> and contributed more than £6bn in tax receipts to the government in the last financial year and £9bn the year before.</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the party would aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/30/tories-would-maximise-north-sea-oil-and-gas-extraction-badenoch-expected-to-say\">to “maximise extraction”</a> of oil and gas in the North Sea if it won the next election. Reform UK has also promised to reverse Labour’s ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/23/reform-uk-promise-to-reverse-ban-on-north-sea-oil-drilling-if-elected\">as a “day one” priority</a> if it comes to power.</p> <p>The Guardian reported over the summer that senior government advisers had told North Sea investors that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">new drilling could still move ahead</a> despite the election promise to ban it, provided the projects were close to existing pipeline infrastructure and did not extend into “greenfield” areas.</p> <p>“Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” one energy investor said.</p> <p>The source said that while Treasury officials were open to considering future North Sea oil and gas projects, the plans were unlikely to be well received by Ed Miliband, the secretary of state of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p> <p>Miliband reportedly refused to leave his post in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle last week. ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, who first reported the claims, said it was “one part of the reshuffle that didn’t quite go Starmer’s way”.</p> <p>• The headline and introductory text of this article were amended on 11 September 2025 to clarify what Dale Vince is urging the government to do. We regret that an earlier version said he was calling on the government “to allow new North Sea oil and gas projects”; in fact, he was calling for a guaranteed minimum price for the oil and gas produced by existing North Sea fields.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/ukraine-amputee-veterans-disability-war-invasion-daniel-melnyk-marta-syrko\">military personnel who have been seriously injured</a> in the three-year war against Russia.</p> <p>During the trip to the Ukrainian capital, he and a team from his Invictus Games Foundation are set to detail new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded, with the eventual aim of providing help to all areas of the country.</p> <p>Earlier this year it was estimated that the Ukraine war had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/kyiv-league-of-the-mighty-how-amputee-football-supports-ukraine-survivors\">Kyiv’s League of the Mighty: how amputee football supports Ukraine’s survivors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian on an overnight train to the capital, the Duke of Sussex said: “We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.”</p> <p>He added: “We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”</p>    <p>The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded amputees. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/10/prince-harry-makes-unannounced-visit-to-wounded-veterans-in-ukraine\">visited the centre in April</a>, but met her by chance a couple of months ago in the US.</p> <p>“I bumped into Olga in New York. It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said ‘the biggest impact you have is coming to Kyiv’. I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.</p> <p>“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”</p> <p>Ukraine first took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/invictus-games\">Invictus Games</a> in 2017, but enthusiasm and need for the competition, which was founded by the Prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.</p> <p>The Duke remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.</p>    <p>“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out. Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield. It means so much to us, because it means so much to them.”</p> <p>During the trip, the Prince is due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He is expected to spend time with 200 veterans, who have also been invited. He is also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.</p> <p>Travelling to Kyiv would give him a chance to talk to veterans, and also see some of the destruction first-hand, he said. While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.</p> <p>Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become “a key function in veterans’ healthcare.</p> <p>“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy.”</p> <p>By March this year, more than 22,000 veterans across Ukraine had accessed benefits like gym memberships and pool passes.</p> <p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Bride finally tracks down awkward-looking stranger she and husband noticed only when looking through photos</p>",
    "content": "<p>A baffled bride has solved the mystery of the awkward-looking stranger who crashed her wedding four years ago.</p> <p>Michelle Wylie and her husband, John, registered the presence of their unidentifiable guest only as they looked through photographs of their wedding in the days after the happy occasion.</p> <p>Who was the tall man in a dark suit, distinguished by the look of quiet mortification on his face? But their family and friends could offer no explanation, nor could hotel staff at the Carlton hotel in Prestwick, where the event took place in November 2021. An appeal on Facebook likewise yielded no clues.</p> <p>Eventually, with the mystery still niggling, Wylie asked the popular Scottish content creator Dazza to cast the online net wider – and a sheepish Andrew Hillhouse finally stepped forward.</p> <p>In his explanatory post on Facebook, Hillhouse admitted that he had been “cutting it fine, as I’m known to do” when he pulled up at the wedding venue with five minutes to spare. Spotting a piper and other guests, he followed them into the hotel – “I remember thinking to myself: ‘Cool, this is obviously the right place’” – unaware that he had the address completely wrong and was supposed to be at a ceremony 2 miles away in Ayr.</p>    <p>He was initially unperturbed to find himself surrounded by strangers as the ceremony began – at the marriage he was due to attend, the only person he knew was the bride, Michaela, while his partner, Andrew, was part of the wedding party. It was when an entirely different bride came walking down the aisle that he realised: “OMG that’s not Michaela … I was at the wrong wedding!”</p> <p>Hillhouse said: “You can’t exactly stand up and walk out of a wedding mid-ceremony, so I just had to commit to this act and spent the next 20 minutes awkwardly sitting there trying to be as inconspicuous as my 6ft 2 ass could be.”</p> <p>At the end of the ceremony, Hillhouse, who is from Troon, was hoping to make a discreet exit, only to be waylaid by the wedding photographer, who insisted he join other guests for a group shot. He can be spotted looming uncomfortably at the very back of the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/02/paris-startup-invitin-app-selling-strangers-invites-to-weddings\">‘As if we’re real guests’: the startup selling strangers invitations to weddings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His post continued: “Rushed outside, made some phone calls and made my way to the correct wedding, where I was almost as popular as the actual bride and groom, and spent most of the night retelling that story to people.”</p> <p>For Michelle Wylie, this amiable resolution brings to a close years of speculation.</p>    <p>She told BBC Scotland: “It would come into my head and I’d be like: ‘Someone must know who this guy is.’ I said a few times to my husband: ‘Are you sure you don’t know this guy, is he maybe from your work?’ We wondered if he was a mad stalker.”</p> <p>She is now Facebook friends with Hillhouse and the pair have met in person to cement their coincidental bond.</p> <p>“I could not stop laughing,” said Wylie. “We can’t believe we’ve found out who he is after almost four years.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p> <p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p> <p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\" data-alt=\"a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile.</p> <p>The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further.</p> <p>“Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.”</p> <p>The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London.</p> <p>Business groups have blamed Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution</a>, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business.</p> <p>Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade.</p> <p>“The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.”</p> <p>The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.</p> <p>However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence.</p> <p>Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.”</p> <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on.</p> <p>“Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.”</p> <p>Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed.</p> <p>The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">jumped to 3.8% in July</a>, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.</p> <p>Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.</p>",

Inland areas will also experience stormy weather, with most of England and Wales experiencing 45mph to 55mph gusts.</p> <p>Delays to transport are likely, along with a slight risk of injuries and danger to life from flying debris, the forecaster added.</p> <p>Stephen Kocher, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said that from Sunday, strong west or southwesterly winds would arrive at coastal areas in south-west England and Wales then spread inland.</p> <p>The Met Office said the weather had been caused by a deepening area of low pressure travelling eastwards across the Atlantic.</p> <p>While there has been speculation that the weekend’s weather will bring the first named storm of the season – expected to be Storm Amy – the Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said on Friday that there was currently no plan to name the storm.</p> <p>“Obviously we are in meteorological autumn now; it’s the sort of weather that we do expect at this time of year,” he said. “So it’s nothing unusual, particularly – perhaps it’s just the contrast with the weather that we have enjoyed over most of the summer.”</p> <p>The Met Office has advised those in the alert area to prepare by protecting their property, including securing loose outdoor items such as bins, sheds, fences and garden furniture.</p> <p>There will be a brief reprieve from the intense weather on Tuesday but Madge warned that more severe gales could hit exposed coastal areas again on Wednesday. He said it was too early to tell where the impact would be but that it would be less severe than the winds arriving on Sunday.</p> <p>“Drivers are really going to feel the effects of the early autumnal weather this weekend,” said Rod Dennis, a spokesperson for the RAC breakdown service.</p> <p>“This will particularly be the case later on Sunday and into the new working week – strong gusty winds will make driving conditions challenging across a large swathe of southern and western Britain.</p> <p>“The wind will be particularly noticeable on more exposed roads, like those over the moors in Devon and Cornwall, so drivers may like to delay their journeys or seek other routes.</p> <p>“We urge anyone setting out to reduce their speeds while driving and pass high-sided vehicles with particular care.”</p> <p>Sunshine and drier conditions are most likely to be found in the east, though temperatures will remain on the cooler side, with highs of about 17C to 18C expected in London on Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/mps-asda-app-loans-wagestream",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Retailer’s owner has stake in Wagestream, which offers workers loans of up to £25,000</p>",
    "content": "<p>An influential group of MPs has sought assurances that Asda is not “squeezing staff” to drive profit after it emerged they are being offered high-interest loans by Wagestream, a company in which the retailer’s owner has a stake.</p> <p>The business and trade select committee has written to Asda over its links to the “financial wellbeing app” that recently began offering the supermarket’s staff loans of up to £25,000. The default arrangements for Wagestream’s “workplace loans” involve debt repayments being directly deducted from workers’ pay packets.</p> <p> A holding company controlled by Asda’s private equity owner TDR Capital is a shareholder in Wagestream, which has been offering Asda workers a range of other services, including savings pots and wage advances, since 2023.</p> <p>Documents filed at Companies House show that the holding company, Bellis Financial Investments 2, is one of a number of shareholders in Wagestream, alongside former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital, and social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund.</p> <p>However, the Guardian understands that the retailer did not flag its financial link to Wagestream to staff when it initially launched the service to workers two years ago. Wagestream – which this week rebranded itself as Stream – started offering “workplace loans” to Asda staff earlier this year.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade committee, said he had written to Asda “to ask them to reassure us that frontline workers aren’t left facing sky-high interest rates, and that its workplace lending is compliant with Asda’s legal requirements under employment law”.</p> <p>“Asda is one of Britain’s most important employers with over 150,000 workers and is at the heart of our grocery market,” he said. </p> <p>“Our concern today is that instead of easing Asda’s debts, its parent company may<strong> </strong>be piling pressure on Asda’s people – squeezing staff to service liabilities and drive profit to its financial investments. If this is the case, it raises serious questions as to Asda’s responsible stewardship, and the long-term financial sustainability of the business as a whole.”</p> <p>Asda’s finance director, Michael Gleeson, told the committee in 2023 that a £100m investment in Wagestream and two other financial services businesses had been funded out of proceeds from the £1.7bn sale of Asda’s warehouses, which the company now has to pay rent on under a leaseback deal. “We are part owners of each of those three companies,” he told MPs. Bellis is understood to hold a 4% stake in Wagestream.</p> <p>Asda said it does not pay Wagestream for any services or receive any financial benefit if a member of staff chooses to use the app. However, as a shareholder, Asda’s parent group has a direct interest in its success and would have the right to a share of any future dividend payments or proceeds from the sale of the group.</p> <p>Wagestream is yet to pay a dividend and remains loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in 2024.</p> <p>That could change before long, however, with revenues having grown by more than two-thirds (64%) to £36.9m last year, when it handed out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn.</p> <p>The rollout of workplace loans could propel earnings, which have so far relied on fees linked to its wage advance product. Wagestream said a rise in revenues in the upcoming year would probably outpace costs and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Asda, which is the UK’s third largest supermarket, said: “Asda offers colleagues access to a range of established financial products through a partner regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These include salary advances, workplace loans and savings products paying a competitive interest rate of 4.33%, which is currently used by more than 18,000 colleagues.</p> <p>“Many other large employers, including all of Asda’s direct competitors in the grocery sector, offer similar products to their employees through the same or competitor providers.”</p> <p>Asda added that all applications for Wagestream’s workplace loans were subject to “robust affordability checks” before being approved. “At present, fewer than 2% of Asda colleagues have taken out a loan. The representative APR on these loans is 13.9%.”</p> <p>Wagestream began rolling out the loans to clients including Asda at the end of 2024. Those loans come with a representative APR of between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.</p> <p>But the ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its model still saves borrowers an average of £593 a loan, with customers having been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the app.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said it was concerned about the financial links between Asda and Wagestream: “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that TDR has a financial interest in the app that facilitates Asda workers taking these financial risks, while also being the overall decision-maker for how much these workers are paid and the hours they are able to work.”</p> <p>“We now find out that Wagestream is offering dangerous loans at high interest rates and GMB members working in Asda tell us they have used the app to take advances on their pay, which can contribute to a cycle of debt.</p> <p>“The bottom line is that employers should pay workers enough to live on, to have savings and to not need to rely on dangerous high-interest loans or advances on their pay just to cover day-to-day living costs.”</p> <p>Wagestream said in a statement that “as a regulated financial services provider, Wagestream has a conflicts of interest policy and has implemented processes to review and monitor conflicts of interest to comply with FCA rules.”</p> <p>“TDR Capital’s holding in Wagestream does not create a conflict as it falls well below the thresholds set out by the FCA. As a minority shareholder, TDR Capital does not have operational or day-to-day control of any of Wagestream’s undertakings,” the statement added.</p> <p>Wagestream said it considers potential conflicts when deciding on whether to partner with employers, which in turn sign its terms and conditions that require good consumer outcomes and transparency, including around fees.</p> <p>TDR declined to comment.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/digested-week-marsupial-brings-cheer-in-dark-and-dysfunctional-days",
    "description": "<p>It was left to a – albeit extinct – tiny relative of the kangaroo to offer some relief from the blizzard of major events</p>",
    "content": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Where to start in a week so fraught with major events you could hardly draw breath for the news flashes? It started with Trump’s alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book,” shared by the Democrats on social media on Monday and leading to the discovery of a name not widely recognised in the US but of intense interest in the UK – Peter Mandelson. The British ambassador to the US had proffered an undiplomatically warm birthday message to the late child sex offender financier, starting a press scramble that ended, on Thursday, with Keir Starmer firing him.</p> <p>That was just the beginning. As Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Nato jets, forecasts of a third world war gained pace and in the US, Charlie Kirk, a rightwing political activist, was assassinated in front of a crowd in Utah. Another firing followed: at MSNBC, the analyst Matthew Dowd was swiftly booted for suggesting that Kirk, who had a history of making racist and sexist remarks, had learned the hard way that, “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”. On the Christian right, meanwhile, Kirk instantly rose to the status of an American martyr.</p> <p>If it was a week in which America looked, once again, like an increasingly dysfunctional and unhappy place and Europe slid towards darker days, it was left to Australia to cheer us, which it did with – what else? – the discovery of a new marsupial: a tiny, previously unknown relative of the kangaroo, a sort of mouse-wallaby hybrid species of “bettong”, identified by its fossil remains because, in keeping with the general state of the world and because we can’t have nice things, it turns out it is already extinct.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Also extinct (almost): that species of lovable eccentric billionaire who stays out of politics and spends his cash on decommissioned Soviet fighter jets and a luxury car collection. In other words, Larry Ellison, the 90s playboy and founder of Oracle with the lustrous, tan-coloured mane to make Elon Musk weep. At the turn of the millennium Ellison was the world’s richest man, long since eclipsed by the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos, but like all things from the 90s he’s back with a vengeance and this week, after Oracle’s stock price soared, once again took the top spot.</p> <p>Per the business pages, Oracle’s shares soared owing to a “rosy outlook for [the company’s] cloud infrastructure business and AI deals”. I’m more interested in revisiting the greatest hits of a billionaire whose biographer, Mike Wilson, once described as “a one-man amusement park, Larryland.” To wit: Ellison flying his Marchetti S.211 fighter plane in mock dog fights over the Pacific with his son, David; winning the Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 with a young Lachlan Murdoch onboard; and my favourite Ellison flourish, what was said to be his favourite chat-up line of the 90s – “Can I buy you a car?”</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>More news from Australia that is almost as charming as a marsupial: Russell Crowe (I know, he’s originally from New Zealand), gussied up in a Nazi uniform and gone the full Brando in the trailer for Nuremberg. Crowe plays Hermann Göring, who at the time of his capture apparently weighed 280 pounds and was described by an allied soldier who witnessed it as a “huge bulk”, an acting challenge to which Crowe appears to have magnificently risen. The forthcoming movie co-stars Rami Malek, Michael Shannon and Leo Woodall, but clearly this is Rusty’s picture. His German accent – “I vill have, as you say, my day I court” – is worth the ticket price alone and appears to be a combo of ‘Allo ‘Allo!’s Gestapo corps and, as Crowe once said of his accent in Gladiator, “Royal Shakespeare Company three pints after lunch.” Bravo!</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The huge bulk of Emily’s saggy old cat, Bagpuss, is coming back in a new film to make gen X cry. For those not born in the 20th century, Bagpuss was an old cloth cat with pink stripes and piercing blue eyes, who lived in a shop for lost and found items with his friends Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the doll and the mice on the mouse organ (“Heave! Heave!). News of the reboot this week sent me straight to YouTube to watch the opening sequence of Oliver Postgate’s TV show, broadcast in the mid- to late-70s on repeat and almost unbearably poignant, not least because it’s narrated in an accent that no longer exists.</p> <p>Bagpuss (“The most important, the most beautiful, the most magical, saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world”) is embedded in the earliest TV memories of those of us who were kids at the time and, having a moment at my screen, I called over my 10-year-old to share in the magic. She watched for 20 seconds, said, “Boring!”, patted me sympathetically on the arm and walked off. “Baggy and a bit loose at the seams,” I murmured in unison with Postgate, “but Emily loved him.”</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Prince Harry met the king in London this week after an apparent estrangement of 19 months and, according to those monitoring the arrival and departure of the prince’s car, the audience lasted 54 minutes. But that’s a generous interpretation of the actual face time involved in the “private tea”, which, allowing for entrance and egress through Clarence House, settling in and waiting time, surely came out closer to half an hour. Did Harry whip out his phone and show his father photos of the two grandchildren he’s spent almost no time with? Did the king ask about Meghan? Was it all about money? Was there ever a more pitiful sight than, generation after generation, the royal family’s cold and strained filial relations?</p>",

This increase was driven primarily by the services and construction sectors, but production output fell by 1.3%. However, growth is slowing in these sectors and is likely the result of actions taken by the Labour government now being realised, with the increase in employer national insurance contributions having a significant impact on business confidence. </p> <p>“With the summer now over and the economy supposedly getting out of its slumber, we now face continuing uncertainty in the lead up to the budget in November given the precarious position the Chancellor finds the public finances in. It is estimated that the fiscal hole that needs to be plugged is anywhere between £20bn and £50bn. While that is a wide range, it means one thing for a government that has shown it will struggle to cut spending – more tax rises. </p> <p>“Speculation is already rife about which taxes will be raised, and without the ability to raise the main revenue generators – income tax, national insurance and VAT – the government is left with targeting multiple sectors for small amounts of revenue.

    "content": "<p>The chief executive of Barclays has said the UK government needs to limit pay rises for public sector workers and resist a further “squeeze” on banks with tax increases.</p> <p>CS Venkatakrishnan said the government needed to look at its own spending levels as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seeks ways to address a fiscal hole when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">announces her budget in November</a>.</p> <p>“We need to curb expenditure at the government level,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8589b6ec-1c3b-4c1d-8352-8664325bf698\">told the Financial Times</a>. “We need to find a way to curb wage inflation.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishnan said that while the government needed to restrict rising “public sector” wages, the inflationary impact of pay rises was an issue across the UK economy.</p> <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said Venkatakrishnan had a “brass neck” calling for pay rise curbs when his pay packet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/barclays-profit-rise-ceo-cs-venkatakrishnan-more-pay\">doubled to £10.5m last year</a>, the highest for a Barclays boss since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-pay\">Bob Diamond received £17m in 2011.</a></p> <p>“It is frankly insulting for him to call on nurses, teachers and paramedics to tighten their belts when he’s just pocketed a bumper pay rise,” said Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>“Instead of talking down public sector workers, those with the broader shoulders – including the mega-wealthy like CS Venkatakrishnan, banks and gambling companies – should contribute their fair share to funding our schools, hospitals and local authorities.”</p> <p>While UK wage growth has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/the-uk-labour-market-is-cooling-but-this-is-a-slowdown-not-a-collapse\">slowed in recent months</a>, it is still running at an annual rate of 5.7% in the public sector, excluding bonuses. Private sector wage growth is running at an average of 4.8%.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: “Someone happily accepting a pay package of £10.5m doesn’t really have the moral authority to tell nurses and teachers and local government workers they shouldn’t get a pay rise.</p> <p>“It would be a lot easier to fund decent wages for public sector workers if the wealth of multimillionaires was taxed more effectively, so if the Barclays CEO is concerned about the sustainability of public finances, he would look a lot less crass and hypocritical if he used his position to argue for a wealth tax on the super-rich instead.” </p> <p>Venkatakrishnan also said the banking sector should not be a target of further taxation. “UK banks are taxed more than banks anywhere else,” he said. “How much more are you going to squeeze this?”</p> <p>Banks are concerned that the industry’s reliable profits, fuelled by higher interest rates, could make it one of the targets for tax increases as Reeves comes under pressure to raise taxes to address a hole in her fiscal plans.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/29/uk-bank-shares-tumble-after-call-for-windfall-tax-on-lenders-in-budget\">UK bank shares tumbled</a>, cutting the combined market value of some of the biggest companies in the sector by more than £6bn, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the budget spooked investors.</p> <p>“I hope it’s an extremely low possibility,” said Venkatakrishnan. “London is a great global financial centre and the path to growth does not lie to taxing the sector even more. I have had the view from day one that this is a government that is pro business and particularly pro the financial industry.”</p> <p>He claimed the UK banks had, in effect, a total tax rate of about 46% last year, compared with 28% in New York and 29% to 39% in the EU.</p> <p>Barclays made £5.7bn in pre-tax profits last year in the UK, and paid almost £1.4bn in total tax. Of this, £198m was corporation tax and £154m for the bank levy.</p> <p>“What I hope and expect is that they will take this time to think through the difficult choices they have to make,” Venkatakrishnan said. “No budget keeps everyone happy, but the object of it is to foster growth in the country.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishan has been a vocal supporter of Reeves and the wider Labour government’s policies since it took power last summer, but has recently spoken out against proposals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/13/uk-bank-ringfencing-deregulation-financial-services-rachel-reeves\">change ringfencing rules</a> that force UK banks to separate their retail and riskier investment banking operations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former White House adviser turns spotlight on ‘resilient’ region with new podcast Forged in the North</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a “resilience and grit” that comes from being born in the north-east of England, says Fiona Hill, who went from a working-class childhood in County Durham to a top intelligence job at the heart of the White House.</p> <p>But, she believes, it is also a big reason why she and other notable high achievers have had the success they have. The secret of success could be being from the north-east.</p> <p>Hill has talked to a number of figures from – or with strong links to – the north-east for her new Forged in the North podcast series, which will be launched at <a href=\"https://newwritingnorth.com/event/fiona-hill-forged-in-the-north/\">Durham book festival in October</a>.</p> <p>They include two global figures originally from the same part of Wallsend: the Cramlington primary school teacher turned superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/22/the-last-ship-review-sting\">Sting</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/05/academicexperts.highereducationprofile\">the Yale historian Paul Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>“It’s basically just listening to two people who seem on the surface so completely different but have this common origin story,” says Hill.</p> <p>Other podcast guests are Lee Hall, the writer of Billy Elliot; Brendan Foster, the founder of the Great North Run; the north-east mayor, Kim McGuinness; the Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Sara Davies; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/03/oscar-conclave-peter-straughan-best-adapted-screenplay\">dramatist Peter Straughan</a>; and the Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p>Hill was born and brought up in Bishop Auckland, the daughter of a coalminer and a midwife. She and her accent went on to be a foreign affairs adviser to US presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump and she is considered one of the world’s leading experts on Russia and Putin.</p> <p>Last year she was named as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/19/labour-defence-adviser-fiona-hill\">three advisers to oversee the UK government’s strategic defence review</a>.</p> <p>The new series is born, Hill says, of a belief that “too much happens down in London, as if the rest of the country doesn’t exist”.</p> <p>The hope is to “put the spotlight on a region that is normally only in the headlines for something going wrong: child poverty, the lowest life expectancy, worst nutrition”, she says.</p> <p>“The north-east is home of the Industrial Revolution – literally the engines of prosperity. Two hundred years ago, it was the forefront of innovation, and we’re saying, there’s still a lot of potential for innovation.”</p> <p>Hill turns 60 this year and is planning a trip back to the north-east from her home in the US. She says: “I’ve always wanted to walk along a portion of Hadrian’s Wall, I want to go back up the Northumberland coast. I want to come back for all the stories and storytelling I remember as a kid from the region.”</p> <p>It was in this context that the idea of the podcast series came about, with the aim of telling stories about the north “not just how it was, but how it is and how it might be”.</p> <p>Many cultural figures have talked passionately about the importance of where they are from. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/bbc-to-be-unashamedly-hull-centric-during-city-year-in-cultural-spotlight\">Hull-born playwright Richard Bean once said</a>: “Thank God I wasn’t born in Guildford. Thank God I was born somewhere there is tragedy and comedy every other second.”</p> <p>Hill says coming from the north-east gives “a certain resilience and grit”. “Being from the north-east grounds you, it’s an anchor, a solid base with a strong sense of what’s right and wrong and a clear perspective and values.”</p> <p>She points to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52269-how-strong-are-regional-identities-in-britain\">a recent poll</a> revealing how people from the north-east have a stronger attachment to their region than other parts of England. “There’s a sense of solidarity that’s been forged in adversity. Everyone’s thrown all kinds of rubbish at the north historically … but it has a resilience.”</p> <p>The importance of investing in people while they are young is a theme of the podcast discussions, says Hill, who got a grant from the Durham Miners’ Association to take a Russian language course to pursue her ambition to go to university.</p> <p>Straughan and Hall got started with enterprise grants and through locally funded theatres. Interestingly, McGuinness and Davies, both younger interviewees, say they had to make their own luck, with Davies using her savings to start her successful business.</p> <p>McGuinness says the series resonated with her ambition for the north-east to be a cultural powerhouse. “This important podcast shines a light on how with the right support, talent can truly thrive.</p> <p>“Funding in our region’s art sector has been outpaced by the south for some time. I’m determined to fix that cultural chasm and the cycle of regional inequality, positioning the north-east as a strong contender in the UK economy.”</p>",
