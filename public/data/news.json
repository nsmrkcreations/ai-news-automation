I think if you look at his finishing skills, heading left, right, top corners, he’s the complete striker at the moment and same you can say from Hugo [Ekitiké]. Very good, very eager, obviously the quality he’s been showing already since, I think, the first session.”</p> <p>Van Dijk said he had spoken to Isak during the international break. “For him it’s obviously about getting as fit as possible, as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, how we do set pieces. So it’s been a good week for him and let’s see tomorrow.”</p> <p>Liverpool have ambitions to challenge for the Champions League after being knocked out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/11/liverpool-psg-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">Paris Saint-Germain on penalties</a> in the last 16 last season. Atlético’s visit is the start of a difficult-looking league stage for Slot’s side, who then travel to Galatasaray and will also face Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, PSV and Inter before Christmas.</p> <p>“I’m confident that we can show Europe that we are a fantastic team, but you have to work for it,” Van Dijk said. “It’s all about the work that you put in, obviously on the pitch but off the pitch as well, in order to be at your best.”</p>",

More than 64,000 Palestinians, the overwhelmingly majority civilians, have been killed so far.</p> \n  <p>Netanyahu’s government has denied the genocide charge which is also being weighed by the International Court of Justice. Netanyahu has escalated the conflict further by ordering an offensive on Gaza City. After a night of intense bombardment, there were reports of a ground attack on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>Netanyahu, however, blamed foreigners for Israel’s increasing diplomatic isolation, which he referred to as “a siege that is organised by a few states”.</p> \n  <p>“One is China, and the other is Qatar. And they are organising an attack on Israel, legitimacy, in the social media of the western world and the United States,” Netanyahu said. </p> \n  <p>“The second thing is something that they can do uniquely in western Europe. Western Europe has large Islamist minorities. They’re vocal. Many of them are politically motivated. They align with Hamas, they align with Iran,” the prime minister said. </p> \n  <p>“They pressure the governments of western Europe, many of whom are kindly disposed to Israel, but they see that they are being overtaken, really, by campaigns of violent protest and constant intimidation.”</p> \n  <p>His remarks seemed to be a reference to UK, France and Belgium who are set to recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly and have been increasingly critical of Israel over the Gaza war.</p> \n  <p>Netanyahu’s rhetoric about isolation was denounced in the Israeli press on Tuesday as a potentially self-fulfilling prophecy. Writing in the Ma’ariv newspaper, the veteran commentator, Ben Caspit, said: “Even in Netanyahu’s terms, a man who has already said all of the most reckless things imaginable, this statement was exceptional in its recklessness, absurdity and madness.”</p> \n  <p>“The man has completely lost his checks, balances and connection to reality,” Caspit wrote.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c90f878f084793c7c162d6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:22:30.186Z\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The IDF Arabic-language spokesperson, Col Avichay Adraee, has issued this warning on social media to Gaza City residents. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The IDF has begun dismantling Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Gaza City is a dangerous combat zone.

Rubio told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.</p> \n  <p>“Obviously they have to decide if they want to do that after last week or not, but we want them to know that if there’s any country in the world that could help end this through a negotiation, it’s Qatar.”</p> \n  <p>Rubio said the US would work with Qatar to finalise a defence agreement soon despite the Israeli military action last

Still, prominent figures on the right – before a shooter was apprehended – declared war on the left, claiming it was responsible for Kirk’s death.</p> \n  <p>There is no evidence of a network supporting the shooter, and Miller did not provide substantiation of his claims that there is a “vast domestic terror movement” at play.</p> \n  <p>Miller also detailed how the administration would use the federal government to achieve this goal.</p> \n  <p>“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, [Department of] Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,” Miller said, adding that they would do this “in Charlie’s name”.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-podcast\">JD Vance threatens crackdown on ‘far-left’ groups after Charlie Kirk shooting</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c928b88f0807088ffe792f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T09:40:27.775Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opening summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog.

It has since been published, but Trump continues to deny being its author.</p> \n  <p>The filing against the NYT, the latest demonstration of the president’s willingness to use legal action against the media, was made by Trump’s lawyers to a district court in Florida on Monday night.</p> \n  <p>It names several articles and one book written by two of the publication’s journalists and published in the lead-up to the 2024 election.</p> \n  <p>“The Times has betrayed the journalistic ideals of honesty, objectivity, and accuracy that it once professed,” it states, also accusing the NYT of being “a leading, and unapologetic, purveyor of falsehoods against President Trump”.</p> \n  <p>The NYT has not yet responded.</p> \n  <p>Read the full story here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-says-he-is-suing-new-york-times-15bn-lawsuit-against-newspaper-ntwnfb\">Donald Trump files $15bn lawsuit against New York Times</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>In other developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump announced he will deploy the national guard to Memphis during an Oval Office ceremony attended by the Tennessee governor Bill Lee.</strong> He added that he is considering sending national guard troops to “Chicago probably next” and floated cities such as St Louis may follow.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A US appeals court ruled that Lisa Cook can remain on the Federal Reserve board, denying Trump’s attempt to remove Cook from the body ahead of a policy meeting scheduled later today.</strong> Trump will likely appeal the ruling to the supreme court.

    "description": "<p>One of Hollywood’s greats who starred in All the President’s Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and The Sting</p>",
    "content": "<p>Robert Redford, who has died aged 89, was the golden boy of American cinema for more than 50 years. </p> <p>In one respect, with his blond good looks, he conformed to a mythic Californian stereotype, or what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman\">Dustin Hoffman</a> called a “walking surfboard”. However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a>, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p>    <p>Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of an accountant with Standard Oil, and his wife, Martha (nee Hart). The family moved to Van Nuys, California, where Robert went to Van Nuys high school. He was blessed early on with a graceful athleticism, excelling in swimming, tennis, football and baseball, the last of which won him a scholarship to the University of Colorado, where he could also indulge his love for climbing and skiing.</p> <p>But he soon became frustrated by what he called “test-tube athletes”. As the character of the Olympic skier that he played in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdd7W_h3VK4\">Downhill Racer</a> (1969) says: ‘“I never knew what it was like to just enjoy a sport. I was always out there grovelling to win. You begin to fear not winning.”</p> <p>When his lack of attendance at baseball practice led to him losing his scholarship, he left for Europe in 1957. Because he had displayed a certain talent as a caricaturist in high school, he did what all hopeful American artists did: he went to paint in Paris before being forced into the realisation that, as an artist, he was mediocre. On his return to the US, he married his girlfriend, Lola Van Wagenen, in 1958 and studied scenic design at the Pratt Institute in New York.</p> <p>When Redford was told that to really understand the principles of scenic design, he must put himself in the actor’s place, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. “At the Academy I got the space and the opportunity to expand and form myself as an actor, but I didn’t learn to act,” he recalled.</p> <p>None the less, in 1959, he made his professional stage debut on Broadway with a small role as a basketball player in Tall Story, which he repeated uncredited in the feature film version starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\">Jane Fonda</a> the following year. During the try-out run for The Highest Tree (1959), a short-lived play about a nuclear scientist, his first child, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome.</p> <p>He made it big on Broadway in Norman Krasna’s Sunday in New York (1961) and even bigger in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/neil-simon-obituary\">Neil Simon</a>’s hit comedy Barefoot in the Park (1963), which he reprised in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY-uQehpXf0\">screen version</a> opposite Fonda in 1967. He remained in the play for the first year of its four-year run, but never worked in the theatre again.</p> <p>At the same time, he was racking up numerous TV credits, including the callow Don Parritt in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sidney-lumet\">Sidney Lumet</a>’s production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eugene-o-neill\">Eugene O’Neill</a>’s The Iceman Cometh (1960) and a memorable appearance as the Angel of Death in an exceptional 1962 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/18/twilight-zone-your-next-boxset\">Twilight Zone</a> episode called Nothing in the Dark.</p>    <p>Redford’s first credited film role was in the untrumpeted War Hunt (1962), an off-beat little picture, shot in 15 days, in which Pollack also made his screen debut as a performer. They played members of a platoon in Korea, one of whom (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/jul/26/nightmare-on-elm-streets-john-saxon-a-life-in-pictures\">John Saxon</a>) is schizophrenic. He goes out on lone missions and kills the enemy with a stiletto. Redford’s character tries to rescue an orphan from Saxon’s influence.</p> <p>It was three years before he returned to the big screen, gaining some attention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/23/obituary-robert-mulligan\">Robert Mulligan’s</a> Inside Daisy Clover (1965), in which he played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/20/biography.film\">Natalie Wood</a>’s egotistical, bisexual matinee idol husband and for which he won the Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer.</p> <p>This promise was fulfilled in his following films, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/29/arthur-penn-obituary\">Arthur Penn</a>’s steamy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EbbnP9dBmk\">The Chase</a> (1966), in which Redford played an escaped convict whom the fair-minded sheriff (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Marlon Brando</a>) tries to protect from being lynched by the inhabitants of a small Texas town. Although the role required Redford to spend much of the film running through rice fields, he opted for that rather than playing the sheriff, the part he was offered originally.</p> <p>He seemed incredibly relaxed and confident in the early stages of his career, rejecting two roles offered to him by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a> – the younger man in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (eventually played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/24/george-segal-obituary\">George Segal</a>), and Benjamin Braddock in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-graduate-review-anne-bancroft-dustin-hoffman\">The Graduate</a>, because he felt too old for the part, even though he and Hoffman, who made his name from the part, were almost the same age. He also turned down the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johncassavetes\">John Cassavetes</a> role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski\">Roman Polanski</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rosemary-s-baby\">Rosemary’s Baby</a>.</p> <p>Instead, he preferred to co-star with Wood again in Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JX84nAZDX4\">This Property Is Condemned</a> (1966), based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a> play, as a mysterious railway official. Next came Barefoot in the Park, and then one of his best-known roles, Sundance <strong>–</strong> a role passed over by Brando, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/warren-beatty\">Warren Beatty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> – opposite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/27/paulnewman.usa1\">Paul Newman</a>’s Butch Cassidy in one of the most successful westerns ever.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/30/guardianobituaries.film\">George Roy Hill</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> (1969) created at its core an irresistible chemistry between its two male leads as charming outlaws, leading to a string of buddy movies, including the equally successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/22/the-sting-best-picture-oscar-1974\">The Sting</a> (1973) with the same director and stars, this time playing scam artists in 1930s Chicago.</p> <p>Between the two hit movies, Redford made several films, the best being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/19/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Michael Ritchie</a>’s satirical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/26/how-hollywood-predicted-the-year-of-the-accidental-politician\">The Candidate</a> (1972), about a presidential campaign, in which he was well cast in the vapid title role, and Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=292Oouog8fI\">The Way We Were</a> (1973). The latter, an odd couple romantic comedy with Redford as an upper-crust Wasp who does not take politics seriously, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbra-streisand\">Barbra Streisand</a> as a working-class Jewish leftist uncompromising in her political beliefs, saw them both performing well within their comfort zones.</p> <p>By the end of the 60s, Redford had become one of the world’s top film stars and box-office attractions, with carefully chosen projects to keep alive his screen persona in glossy Hollywood star vehicles. Among the exceptions were movies that satisfied his liberal leanings, especially <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-alan-pakula-1186240.html\">Alan Pakula</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\">Watergate</a> exposé, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/10/all-the-presidents-men-watergate-conspiracy-richard-nixon-woodward-bernstein-redford-hoffman\">All the President’s Men</a> (1976).</p> <p>The perspicacious Redford had bought an option on the book by the Washington Post journalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/carl-bernstein\">Carl Bernstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/26/pressandpublishing.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">Bob Woodward</a> prior to its publication in 1974 for $450,000. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/25/william-goldman-screenwriter-interview\">William Goldman</a>, who had written three buddy movies in a row for Redford – Butch Cassidy, The Hot Rock (with Segal, 1972) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfZhXhCGwEA\">The Great Waldo Pepper</a> (with Bo Svenson, 1975) – was hired to supply another one for the star and Hoffman, delivering a sort of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Bring Down the Government”, as one Washington Post wit described it.</p>    <p>Of the two leads, Redford had the edge, managing to combine a dry humour, a convincing intelligence and a determined idealism. According to Hoffman, the reason the film was a top earner was because “it is what the public always wanted: that beautiful Wasp finally wound up with a nice Jewish boy”.</p> <p>In the 80s, Redford gradually scaled down his acting, appearing in only four films, having taken up producing and directing. At the same time, he established the Sundance Institute on his 7,000-acre estate in Provo, Utah, providing workshops, development resources and support to promising independent film-makers. </p> <p>In 1978, Redford co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival\">Sundance film festival,</a> held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah every January as a shop window for independent cinema, and remained a godfather to it. A passionate environmentalist, he also co-founded the Institute for Resource Management, a forum to encourage land developers and environmentalists to work together.</p> <p>In later acting assignments, he was shown in a noble, almost saintly, light, consistently backlit to turn his golden hair into a saintly halo: as a prison reformer in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVzHtmJR7g\">Brubaker</a> (1980), a mythical baseball player in The Natural (1984), and the English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (though there was no attempt to get the accent),the lover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/29/margaret-atwood-isak-dinesen\">Karen Blixen</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/reel-history-out-of-africa\">Out of Africa</a> (1985).</p> <p>Redford’s first film as a director, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKkcyK1VpGY\">Ordinary People</a> (1980), was a middle-class family drama, elegantly shot though not very original, with a sentimental father-son solution. Nevertheless, the film won Oscars for best picture and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Trc1lkc6Lo\">best director</a> – Redford went on to win an honorary Oscar, too, in 2002 – as well as best supporting actor, for Timothy Hutton, and best adapted screenplay. Its success encouraged Redford to continue directing over the next decades.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaKVk4hNAY\">The Milagro Beanfield War</a> (1988) was a homespun fable of a New Mexican farmer deflecting water from a housing development to start his own beanfield. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7yeXtBQMU\">A River Runs Through It</a> (1992), shot in Montana (Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for his cinematography), used fly-fishing as a metaphor for life in an understated way; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/dec/14/quiz-show-robert-redford\">Quiz Show</a> (1994) was a gripping account of a television scandal in 50s America, when a winning contestant of a popular programme was exposed as a fraud.</p> <p>Redford directed himself for the first time in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_1dKoCQlxY\">The Horse Whisperer</a> (1998), as a Montana cowboy who cures traumatised horses, a role that fitted him as snugly as his faded denims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">The Legend of Bagger Vance </a>(2000), continued his almost mystic interest in sport with a nostalgic look at golf between the wars, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/thriller.tomcruise\">Lions for Lambs </a>(2007) was a flabbily liberal and verbose response to the Iraq war.</p> <p>He starred in and directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/ricki-flash-wolfpack-company-you-keep-heist-on-the-beach-review\">The Company You Keep</a> (2012), a well-intentioned political drama on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jul/04/artsfeatures2\">Weather Underground</a> 30 years after their terrorist activities. Yet, though one would be hard put to call Redford an auteur, there is no denying that his choice of films reflected his political views and his passion for the American west.</p> <p>From the 90s, the reasons for some of his acting choices were a trifle less clear. In Adrian Lyne’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kA0MydxWUo\">Indecent Proposal</a> (1993), Redford’s character, admitting to advanced middle-age, offers to pay $1m to sleep with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/demi-moore\">Demi Moore</a>, with her husband’s approval. He finally gave in to advancing years at the age of 68 and played a crusty and grizzled rancher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/24/features\">Lasse Hallstrom</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/16/drama\">An Unfinished Life</a> (2005), the sort of role Newman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/clinteastwood\">Clint Eastwood</a> had been playing for years.</p> <p>Never straying too far from his persona of dignified masculinity, Redford continued to be active into his 80s. His solo performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/26/all-is-lost-review\">All Is Lost</a> (2013) as a castaway seaman trying to survive was a tour de force, while he demonstrated his fitness in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/a-walk-in-the-woods-review-robert-redford-bill-bryson\">A Walk in the Woods</a> (2015), and his integrity as the TV anchor Don Rather in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/truth-review-cate-blanchett-60-minutes-george-w-bush-war-record\">Truth</a> (2015). His last substantial role was as the real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker in the comedy drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/the-old-man-the-gun-review-robert-redford-sissy-spacek-casey-affleck\">The Old Man &amp; the Gun</a> (2018).</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, an artist, whom he married in 2009 after a long relationship, and three children, Shauna, James and Amy, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1985.</p> <p>• Robert Redford, actor, producer and director, born 18 August 1936; died 16 September 2025</p> <p>• Ronald Bergan died in 2020</p>",

What once felt impossible can be normalised step by step, until the unthinkable is treated as common&nbsp;sense.</p> <p>The strength of his piece lies in how it makes the issue personal. By asking us to picture the knock at the door, the packed bags by the hallway, or the quiet hostility from a stranger on a bus, he shows that this is not about statistics but about neighbours, colleagues and friends being treated as outsiders.</p> <p>This is not unique to Britain. Far-right parties across Europe are pushing “remigration” into the political mainstream, and Britain is not immune. The danger is that a hostile environment rarely stops at the margins. It spreads into daily life, encouraging cruelty and suspicion, making racial abuse easier to excuse and prejudice easier to voice. Even if mass deportations never take place on the scale some imagine, the harm is already being felt.</p> <p>The question Liew poses is simple: if this direction continues, what kind of country will we become and who will have the courage to say “enough” before it is too late.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• Thank you, Jonathan Liew, for speaking with such clarity for me as the son of Caribbean immigrants who came to this country as British citizens at the invitation of the British government in 1962. I was born here, have a UK passport, and have contributed to British society. This is my home. But I am scared that a Nigel Farage-led government would want to enact large-scale repatriation of people like me.</p> <p>For people of colour, this isn’t an exaggeration – it is based on fact. The UK has had a growing tolerance of racism and xenophobia, but this is the recooked racism of Enoch Powell and the National Front of the last century – and it’s getting nasty. The time to be sitting in complicit silence is over. <br><strong>Cllr Mark Blake</strong><br><em>Green party, Haringey, London</em></p> <p>• I found Jonathan Liew’s article sad and troubling. My father was Polish and, growing up in the 1950s and 60s in the UK, I was sometimes worried that I had a foreign name. But nothing was said or implied, and being white meant I was not an immediate target for racists. And then we became, I thought, a more tolerant society, with racism called out and reduced to a tiny minority of bigots. But in 2016 came Brexit, leading to the shameful return of the open racism we see today.</p> <p>Old fears are being renewed, and our spineless leaders seem incapable of standing up against this putrid tide. My only hope is that the majority of people, who are not racist, can bring strong influence to bear on our representatives at all levels, and let our own voices be heard. This must stop.<br><strong>Maria Koval</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• I am white, living in Lincolnshire and married to a first-generation Indian immigrant. In this part of the world, not only has Reform UK captured the hearts and minds of many neighbours, but you can see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/23/members-of-far-right-party-organising-asylum-hotel-protests-across-uk-facebook-posts-show\">Homeland party</a>, with its policy of remigration, gaining strength. Jonathan Liew’s piece so clearly brought home the rising terror that I now feel for my family, and the need to push back more forcefully against support for these policies.<br><strong>Patrick Horton</strong><br><em>Stamford, Lincolnshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p><strong>Mary Margaret McCabe</strong> says<strong> </strong>philosophy can be done just by conversation, to include those with high levels of education and those who have little</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jay Miller’s account of teaching philosophy in prison is powerful and welcome (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/09/teaching-philosophy-in-prison-college-students-inmates\">‘You want to talk about a world of lies?’ Teaching philosophy in prison, 9 September</a>). This kind of “public philosophy”, which includes the excluded, is of profound value, he&nbsp;argues. Remarkably, philosophy in prisons is “A kaleidoscopic assortment of jokes, stories, anecdotes and philosophical insights …” This picture is familiar for the UK charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.philosophyinprison.com/\">Philosophy in&nbsp;Prison</a><em>. </em></p> <p>The puzzle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56yN2zHtofM\">Trigger’s broom</a>, for example, can generate a joyous discussion of identity, time, the rights of work, relativism, freedom and responsibility, and happiness –&nbsp;where the whole room is focused&nbsp;and participating.</p> <p>For such intractable questions, no one in the room has a definitive answer, neither the “professional” philosophers, nor those wondering about Trigger for the first time. So philosophical discussion has an equalising effect – everyone is puzzled, no one is disqualified from having a view, nor from arguing it well. It seems obvious that this kind of work is important for its own sake as well as for its effect on&nbsp;participants. But one feature of the prison population in the UK that Miller does not address directly is the high levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons\">functional illiteracy</a>.</p> <p>Offering prisoners university courses works for those who read and feel comfortable with writing. But philosophy can be done just by conversation, to include both those with high levels of education and those who have little. Anyone may participate; disagreement itself generates a toleration that manifests itself on the wing; and educational doors open afterwards. Philosophy in Prison does philosophy just by talking, in the anomalous public space of prison, and it matters&nbsp;for&nbsp;anyone in the room.<br><strong>Mary Margaret McCabe</strong><br><em>Professor of </em><em>ancient </em><em>philosophy </em><em>emerita, King’s College London; </em><em>Chair of trustees, Philosophy in Prison</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The argument that mastering AI is a life skill that students need in preparation for the labour market is unconvincing. Our experience is that generative AI undermines teaching and learning, bypasses reflection and criticality, and deflects students from reading&nbsp;original material.</p> <p>Student misuse of generative AI is widespread. Claims that AI helps preparation or research is simply cover for students taking shortcuts that do not develop their learning skills. Assessments are widely channelled through ChatGPT, disregarding universities’ usually feeble guidance and rules. Generative AI results in generic, dull and often factually incorrect output. </p> <p>For example, we asked students to interpret a short article by Henry Ford from 1922. Many answers suggested that the autocratic and racist Ford was developing a “sophisticated HR performance management function for his business” and that he was a “transformational leader”. </p> <p>In many degree programmes, LLMs have little to no practical value. Their use sabotages and degrades students’ learning and undermines critical analysis and creativity.

However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by Sydney Pollack, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to F Scott Fitzgerald’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-obituary\">Robert Redford obituary</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c993938f0862eec18cf422\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T16:44:10.087Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Film director James Gunn shared a tribute to Redford on Instagram and wrote: “I grew up with his [Redford’s] movies: his quiet, unforced performances and ever-present grace.

It’s got some great 1970s Hollywood moments: doubts about Redford as leading man, Steve McQueen bailing on the project over who would get top billing and daft amounts of money being thrown around by inexperienced producers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Newman was Goldman’s choice from the moment the film was bought, but the casting for Sundance was trickier. Fox initially wanted Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in a 1958 western called <em>Cowboy </em>along with Glenn Ford. Lemmon was not keen on spending a lot of time riding horses again and told them he was not interested. The studio then turned their attention to Steve McQueen and although he liked the script, he dropped out, reportedly in a disagreement over who got top billing.</p> <p>Newman’s wife Joanne Woodward suggested 32-year-old Redford, who had appeared in a few films but was better known as a stage actor. Zanuck, who was a production manager on the film, thought Redford was too lightweight for the role and changed his mind only after seeing raw footage of Newman and Redford together and realising that they had a true chemistry on screen.</p> <p>“I wasn’t that well known at the time and although my agency thought I would be right for the part, 20th Century didn’t want me,”<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/robert-redford-dead-sundance-kid-age-cause-b2582661.html\"> Redford </a>told a television interviewer more than 40 years later. “They wanted Steve McQueen.

I thought he was great.”</p> <p>Redford’s stance on Trump changed over the years. In 2015 he told Larry King: “Look he’s got such a big foot in his mouth, I’m not sure you’re going to get it out. But on the other hand, I’m glad he’s in there.”</p>    <p>He added: “I’m glad he’s in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that’s very needed. Because on the other side, it’s so bland, it’s so boring, it’s so empty.”</p> <p>Four years later during the calls for Trump’s impeachment, Redford’s opinion shifted. “It is painfully clear we have a president who degrades everything he touches,” he wrote in a Washington Post comment piece. “A person who does not understand (or care?) that his duty is to defend our democracy.”</p> <p>He expanded on those thoughts later in the same year, admitting he wanted to “give the guy a chance” when Trump was first elected.

But it was his first pairing with Sting co-star Paul Newman that distils the performer’s essence. Although the movie is unable to fess up to its bromantic longings – did any woman in a buddy movie ever look more like a gooseberry than poor Katharine Ross? – it’s still worth seeing for Redford’s sunny charm. Even then, it seemed to trouble him faintly, as though he was worried we might take him for a himbo. The studio did. “He’s just another California blond,” said one executive. “Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him.” But Newman helped win him the part. Redford got a shock when he saw the first cut. “I said: ‘What the hell is that song doing in there? Raindrops? It’s not even raining. On a bicycle?’”</p> </blockquote> <p>The full top ten is:</p> <p>10. Brubaker (1980)</p> <p>9. The Twilight Zone – “Nothing in the Dark” (1962)</p> <p>8. The Great Gatsby (1974)</p> <p>7.

It spans his early career as an unlikely star and includes his honorary Oscar and the award of his Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p> <p>There are a couple of entries that cover his collaborations with Paul Newman, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (poster above). Here’s an excerpt from Scott Tobias’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">50th anniversary piece</a> from 2019:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford’s taciturn sharpshooter. But he’s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn’t have the stomach for violence; it’s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he’s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He’s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him.</p> <p>Audiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/true-grit-john-wayne-1969-henry-hathaway\">True Grit</a> had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre’s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s. With Ross at the center of a love triangle between friends, the film attempted to bring Jules and Jim to the American mainstream, taking a lesson from the French new wave on how to revivify old Hollywood craft.</p> <p>It still works spectacularly well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full gallery is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-a-life-in-pictures\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c964268f0862eec18cf0e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbradshaw\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T13:22:38.305Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Robert Redford began his career as a blond bombshell at a time when American cinema favoured grit, then turned into a supremely assured director and unlikely keeper of the indie flame, writes Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw in his appreciation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, it wasn’t cool for star actors to be good-looking. The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a> was very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.</p> <p>When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> in 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustaches, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the Jazz Age conmen caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs. His photograph was in the dictionary next to “handsome”.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">Robert Redford: the incandescently handsome star who changed Hollywood forever</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c95f548f0870640b690766\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T13:16:35.609Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Robert Redford, giant of American cinema, dies aged 89</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Robert Redford, star of Hollywood classics including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a>, The Sting and All the President’s Men, has died aged 89.</p> <p>Redford’s publicist Cindi Berger says the actor died earlier today at his home “at Sundance in the mountains of Utah - the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved.”</p> <p>“He will be missed greatly,” Berger says, adding that the family are requesting privacy.</p> <p>Redford was one of the defining movie stars of the 1970s, crossing with ease between the Hollywood new wave and the mainstream film industry, before also becoming an Oscar-winning director and producer in the ensuing decades.

You’re going to see street vendors. But it just seemed like a ghost town during that time. No one was out on the street.</p> <p>I was going to open the new Silver Lake location of Taqueria Frontera at the beginning of June. And then the raids happened. It didn’t seem like we should have a celebration or a grand opening.</p> <p>I reached out to Javier Cabral from [the hyperlocal news site] LA Taco, and I said to him, “I want to try to help out. Whatever I can do. Do you know a good organization?” And he said: “Oh, yeah. <a href=\"https://mycielo.org/\">CIELO</a> is a great organization.”</p> <p>I talked to someone at CIELO, Comunidades Indígenas en Liderazgo (Indigenous Communities in Leadership). I was just like: “Taco Tuesday is usually a thing. Is it okay if I set up something saying that all proceeds of our trompo [taco] – which is what we sell the most – is going to be donated towards fundraising for CIELO so they can help immigrant families during this time?”</p> <p>We did Taco Tuesday with a purpose, and we ended up raising $4,000 from selling the trompo that day alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids.

And not just that day – a lot of people would come in just to check up on us, on my employees, see how they’re doing, how they’re feeling. There’s no way you could live in Los Angeles without being affected by this. And a lot of my clients were like: “I can’t believe this is going on.” Who doesn’t have a friend or family member or co-worker that isn’t undocumented here in Los Angeles?</p> <p>Street vendors are back out now and more people are outside eating. But I think that it’s still in the back of their minds. Could this happen at any time again? Right now it’s pretty calm, but what happens a month from now if they decide to do it again?</p> <h2>Bulmaro, street vendor</h2> <p>When we started the business, there weren’t many jobs out there. We knew how to make tamales, which is what we sell. Due to the lack of jobs and opportunities, we decided to do what we know how to do. From there, business grew and we started getting more clients, little by little. It’s our sole source of income.</p> <p>Because of the raids, everything stopped. We stopped selling for about a month, without working or anything. We just started working again a little more about two weeks ago. A lot of people don’t go out to buy things anymore because they’re scared. Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues.</p> <p>We haven’t had phone orders, either. We just bring the day’s supply, and sometimes we come back home with tamales or with atol that didn’t sell. It’s never going to be the same as before the raids.</p>    <p>It’s me, my wife and another employee – three of us depend on the business. There’s nothing we can do, we have to keep working. We need to pay rent and bills, even though we’re going outside with fear. There’s no other way. The rent isn’t going to wait. The bills, and the food we need to buy, aren’t going to wait either.</p> <h2>Alejandra Rodriguez, Alex Foods and Cemitas Poblanas</h2> <p>A lot of our customers stopped coming. They were scared because a lot of them are Latino. Even at the local restaurants in the city of West Hollywood, [the workers] have their visas to be here, but they were still scared because of everything that was going on. They were saying that even if you had a visa, even if you had permission to be here, everybody was still getting kicked out.

The crowd loudly chanted the name. The focus of this acclamation was not Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, the organiser of the so-called “free speech” march in central London last Saturday.</p> \n<p>They were instead shouting themselves hoarse for Charlie Kirk, the murdered political activist from Cook County in the US state of Illinois.</p> \n<p>It is unlikely that many of the 110,000 to 150,000 protesters estimated to have been on the streets last weekend, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">what turned out to be the largest rally of its type in British history</a>,<strong> </strong>knew much about Kirk before his death at the hands of a gunman at Utah Valley University.</p> \n<p>The UK version of Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which claims to be the “largest Conservative student movement” in the US, has never really taken off in Britain.</p> \n<p>But they were moved to cheer him on Saturday. Clips of an almost entirely white and predominantly male crowd of Britons chanting the first name of the murdered 31-year-old were lapped up on social media accounts said to be US-based, as was the minute’s silence afterwards.</p> \n<p>“Thousands of British patriots just fell silent in honor of Charlie Kirk in London,” tweeted Eric Daugherty, an assistant news director at the conservative Florida’s Voice website (“Honest political reporting to Florida, minus the mainstream talking points.”)</p> \n<p>It is said that when America coughs, Britain catches a cold.</p> \n<p>The reality with this strain of politics is that there is something of a feedback loop between the US and the UK that is proving mutually beneficial to both sides, said Prof Paul Jackson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pride-in-prejudice-9781526156723/\">Pride in Prejudice: Understanding Britain’s Extreme Right</a>.</p> \n<p>Kirk may not have been a household name in the UK but his murder offered validation for a view that a certain outlook on life is under threat. In turn, the scenes on Saturday provided evidence of the righteousness of the cause back in the US.</p> \n<p>There is history to this mutually enforcing exchange of ideas on the extreme right, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>A certain type of US political thought has never travelled well across the Atlantic, notably the Ku Klux Klan, which grew after the civil war in the late 1860s, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>But other ideas have thrived in the past as they do today, including those contained in Madison Grant’s 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, which influenced some European white supremacists, and Henry Ford’s The International Jew.</p> \n<p>It has not all been one way. The Blood &amp; Honour movement, founded by British neo-Nazi and white power music pioneer Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987, led to the birth of Blood &amp; Honour American Division and Blood &amp; Honour Council US.</p> \n<p>That was the analogue age, though.</p> \n<p>In the digital era, particularly in the so-called “counter-jihad” space that now dominates what is loosely termed the far right, the mutual reinforcement of messages is done in real time. Stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another.</p> \n<p>Kirk himself was one of those who picked up on the case of Lucy Connolly, the 42-year-old English woman –married to a Conservative councillor – who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for calling for hotels that were housing asylum seekers to be burned down during last summer’s riots.<strong> </strong>(She was released in August after serving less than half her sentence.)</p> \n<p>“Every day people say: ‘Well someone should go kill Charlie Kirk.’ I don’t like it, but that is protected speech,” he told GB News. “In America, we care what you do and not what you say.”</p> \n<p>It was of a piece with the general claim that free speech is under threat in the UK, confirmed in the mind of the likes of JD Vance by the UK’s Online Safety Act, aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content, which the US vice-president claims has put Britain on a “very dark path”.</p> \n<p>The amplification of certain causes, the repetition of choice phrases, cannot be said to be highly organised, but it is nonetheless powerful.</p> \n<p>The Infowars website, founded by the prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, promoted Robinson’s content about the rally on Saturday, but also that of a series of obscure accounts on X, said to be based in both the UK and the US.</p> \n<p>“Breaking: London falls silent for fallen hero Charlie Kirk,” said one such account with 335,700 followers that described itself as a defender of western values and culture. “The British media hated him. The British people certainly didn’t.”</p> \n<p>Another account promoted by Jones’s site was that of Naomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer linked to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, who is known for her climate change denial and promotion of “great replacement theory” tropes.</p> \n<p>She tweeted images from the rally to her 436,700 followers that included the words: “White children will grow up as patriots from now on. White guilt is over.”</p> \n<p>Brigitte Gabriel, founder of the anti-Muslim movement Act for America, which claims to have 1,000 local chapters across the US, posted on X: “Don’t let the media downplay how massive this is. Millions of patriots in the UK are standing up for free speech.”</p> \n<p>Then there is Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">who appeared via videolink at Saturday’s rally</a>. It would be difficult to overplay the importance to Robinson of the support of one of the world’s richest men, according to analysts including the Hope Not Hate anti-extremist organisation.</p> \n<p>In lifting the ban on Robinson’s content on X and through his own misleading posts framing him as a free speech warrior persecuted by the state, Musk gave the activist a vital leg-up, it is argued.</p> \n<p>Robinson, a former member of the racist British National party, who has a string of convictions to his name including for assault, using a fake passport, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, is said to have been able to build upon his profile in the US, stir up protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers while pushing anti-immigrant messages that circle around a supposed threat of Islamisation to the UK.</p> \n<p>“When you hear people talk about the special relationship between America and Great Britain, this is the special relationship that you’re seeing here,” Robinson said at the rally.</p> \n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd, in turn.</p> \n<p>Musk is not yet believed to have directly funded anyone in the UK, although he reportedly flirted with offering money to Reform, the rising political party on the right that is led by Nigel Farage. But such transatlantic relationships do exist, albeit they tend to remain below the radar. It is a murky soup – but some of the chunkier players can be made out.</p> \n<p>One is the US tech billionaire Robert Shillman, known as Dr Bob, who in 2018 financed a fellowship that helped pay for Robinson to be employed by the rightwing Canadian media website, Rebel Media, now called Rebel News, on a salary of about £5,000 a month.</p> \n<p>Other Shillman fellows have included Katie Hopkins, the English former reality TV star who compared migrants to cockroaches, and Laura Loomer, the American conspiracy theorist referred to by some as the president’s “de facto national security adviser”.</p> \n<p>The rightwing Middle East Forum thinktank, led by the neoconservative academic Daniel Pipes, has paid for foreign speakers to attend Robinson rallies in the past, in addition to funding the activist’s legal defence.</p> \n<p>There are laws against foreign donations in both the US and the UK but the far-right echo chamber is also clearly a useful tool for those seeking electoral success on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>Trump has had no qualms about bouncing off certain British causes, sometimes unadvisedly. He said he was prepared to apologise in 2018 when he retweeted posts from Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP. But he is notably cautious about certain characters.</p> \n<p>Trump, who will be in the UK for a state visit this week, did not comment on social media about Saturday’s rally. He appears to prefer his outriders to do the work at times, including his son.</p> \n<p>When the rightwing activist Kurt Schlichter claimed – falsely – on X that Robinson had been arrested for reporting on a court case in May 2018, Donald Trump Jr retweeted it, writing: “Reason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.”</p> \n<p>In the UK, Farage, who successfully fought for decades for the UK to leave the European Union and is today riding high in the polls with his anti-immigration populism, has sought to keep a sterile gap between himself and Robinson, who he fears is beyond the pale for much of the British public.</p> \n<p>He steps carefully in the digital space, seeking support but without getting too close to the most strident actors, including those in the US. He is notably quite loth to associate himself too much with Trump these days when he is at home in the UK, given the US president’s poor approval ratings among the British public.</p> \n<p>But his long-standing ties to the Make America Great Again movement remain financially advantageous. This week, Farage apologised for breaching parliamentary rules by failing to register a trip to Florida to headline a fundraising event for Trump. He had been the main speaker at the $500-a-head Republican party dinner in Tallahassee in March.</p> \n<p>Farage hopes to benefit from the promotion of anti-immigrant themes in the digital world, including from US commentators, without putting off those with more mainstream outlooks, say insiders. It will be a difficult trick to get away with – as Musk’s criticism of Farage at the start of the year over his lack of support for Robinson illustrated.</p> \n<p>“British people are kind of looking for an international source of inspiration,” said Jackson. “[Then] some of the reason why somebody like Nigel Farage or Tommy Robinson might be of particular interest in the US is because they’ve had a lot of success in their own terms.</p> \n<p>“Tommy Robinson’s social media profile of the last few years has been highly impactful, even more so since [Musk] reversing his ban from Twitter. Nigel Farage’s impact on Britain shortly before Trump’s first presidency can be seen as perhaps providing some blueprints about how to have impact.”</p> \n<p>Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s long-standing press adviser until he left Reform earlier this year, said he believed the American interest in shaping British politics was also instinctive.</p> \n<p>“Trump sees the UK as the spiritual home of the US,” he said. “He sees our traditional political and legal traditions as the spiritual background to America’s right.</p> \n<p>“Musk certainly feels that way. He sees the UK as the spiritual homeland of the concepts of the American Declaration of Independence and its bill of rights and all the rest of it. This is where freedom was born, right? It’s like losing a great-uncle if it falls.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Big pharmaceutical companies have ditched or paused nearly £2bn in planned UK investments so far this year, causing “suffering” to patients, as ministers gear up for discussions with Donald Trump amid a row over drug pricing.</p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-sector-plan/life-sciences-sector-plan\">plan for the life science sector</a>, a key pillar of the economy, has been thrown into disarray, after US drugmaker MSD’s shock announcement last Wednesday that it would scrap its £1bn London research centre. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/astrazeneca-pauses-200m-investment-in-cambridge-research-site\">AstraZeneca decided to halt a planned £200m expansion</a> of its research facilities in Cambridge.</p> <p>Combined with a scrapped project by AstraZeneca in Liverpool and a shelved Eli Lilly lab in London, four projects worth more than £1.8bn have been pulled or paused this year. In total, decisions over 13 major projects or companies have damaged the UK’s pharma industry since 2022, also including site closures and stock market delistings.</p> <p>Pharma companies have accused the government of not spending enough on new medicines, arguing that there is little incentive for them to develop drugs and test them in a country that does not value innovation sufficiently.</p> <p>More recriminations are expected when MPs on the science, innovation and technology committee question MSD’s UK and Ireland managing director, Ben Lucas, about its decision on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>He will appear alongside AstraZeneca UK president Tom Keith-Roach, Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry chief executive Richard Torbett and representatives of the government, including the science minister Lord Vallance, a former GSK executive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\" data-alt=\"Pharma cancellations map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens, asked the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d15efe-e802-497a-a995-87ca7fdcbe7b\">to offer drug companies a better deal on pricing</a> when the two met at a private dinner in London recently, the Financial Times reported. The intervention came before Trump’s visit to the UK this week. The US president has criticised foreign nations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/01/australia-pbs-medicine-drugs-prices-trump-tariffs\">“freeloading on US innovation”</a>. Drug prices are much higher in the US and companies have been accused of “price gouging” in the past.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Guy Oliver, the UK head of the US drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), told the Times that, because of “chronic underinvestment” in medicines, the US drugmaker had cancelled 34 partnerships with the NHS in the past year. “There is a human cost to all of this. Patients are really suffering, and have been suffering for many, many years now,” he said.</p> <p>A BMS spokesperson said: <em>“</em>Bristol Myers Squibb agrees with the US administration that the UK pays too little for medicines. As a result of today’s commercial and policy environment in the UK, we have materially reduced the size of our UK organisation over the last four years, and we continue to evaluate our level of investment in the country.”</p> <p>Drugmakers have become more vocal over the UK’s shortcomings since months-long <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/media/news/2025/august/accelerated-review-of-vpag-concludes-without-agreement/\">negotiations over drug pricing</a> broke down in late August, when the health secretary, Wes Streeting, gave companies an ultimatum over his latest “generous” offer – but was rejected.</p>    <p>This means that the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing, access and growth, under which pharma companies pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">continues at a rate the industry says is “unsustainable”</a>. The minimum <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/publications/creating-the-conditions-for-investment-and-growth/\">clawback rate of 23.5% for newer medicines is much higher</a> than payment rates in other European countries.</p> <p>A government spokesperson indicated it was willing to reopen talks but stuck to its previous offer, saying: “Our door remains open to future engagement.”</p> <p>MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would discontinue all research and development activities in the UK, which means 125 scientists based at the Francis Crick Institute and the London BioScience Innovation Centre will lose their jobs. </p>    <p>Also last week, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly said its planned London Gateway Lab, part of a £279m investment, was on hold, “as we are awaiting more clarity around the UK life sciences environment”.</p> <p>Britain’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, which was at the forefront of the government’s efforts to make Covid vaccines available during the pandemic, already pulled the plug on the £450m expansion of its vaccine site in Speke in Liverpool in January after failing to agree a state support package.</p> <p>The French pharma group Sanofi’s UK head of market access, Paul Naish, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">has said substantial investment is now on hold</a>. “This is an intolerable situation for too many [patients] in this country and that is why government needs to work with the sector,” he said.</p> <p>The Swiss drugmaker Novartis is also holding off future investments in UK manufacturing or research, it is understood. Over the past 16 years, it has scaled back its UK operations from seven sites and more than 4,000 employees to one site in London housing 1,200 staff. </p>    <p>Meanwhile, Germany’s BioNTech said its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/1-billion-biontech-investment-sets-way-for-jobs-growth-breakthroughs\">£1bn, 10-year partnership with the UK government</a>, aimed at speeding up trials of its cancer medications, remained on track. Several hundred patients have been treated with experimental cancer immunotherapies through the collaboration, and new research centres are planned in London and Cambridge.</p> <p>The US biotech Moderna, known for its Covid vaccine, opened a new vaccine manufacturing site in Harwell, Oxfordshire in May.</p> <h2><strong>Scrapped/paused investments, delistings and site closures in the UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>September</strong> AstraZeneca pauses £200m research lab in Cambridge (1,000 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September </strong>Merck scraps £1bn London research centre (125 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September</strong> Eli Lilly pauses London Gateway lab, part of £279m investment</p> <p><strong>2025</strong><strong>-26</strong> Haleon closing Maidenhead site (435 jobs)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Indivior: based in Slough, delisted from London Stock Exchange (LSE)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Verona Pharma: based in London, sold to MSD after delisting from LSE in 2020</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Adaptimmune Therapeutics sells four cell therapy assets to US WorldMeds and cuts UK workforce by 62%</p> <p><strong>June</strong> GSK shuts Ulverston factory (100 jobs) and makes cuts at Barnard Castle in October (200 jobs)</p> <p><strong>January</strong> AstraZeneca scraps £450m investment in Speke, Liverpool</p> <p><strong>January</strong> Rentschler Biopharma closes Stevenage site (30 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2024</strong> Sanofi reduced its Kymab labs in Cambridge (50 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2023</strong> Recipharm closes Queenborough site on Isle of Sheppey (150 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2022</strong> Novartis sells Grimsby site (200+ jobs)</p>",

He had voted for Starmer in the 2020 contest was now “quite unfavourable” about Keir Starmer and summed it up by saying: ‘<em>The leadership needs to be made aware how unhappy the members are with the direction of government and how it’s functioning.

Agnes was the youngest.</p> <p>Agnes lived in Nanyuki for all of her 21 years, and if she ever travelled it was only to visit her sister Cecilia, who lived several hours away.</p> <p>She started her primary education at a school in Nanyuki, DEB primary, and later joined Gakawa secondary school. She enjoyed lessons and her favourite subject was literature. She also loved music; she would often be caught singing or dancing.</p> <p>She enjoyed busying herself in the kitchen and spending her spare time with her extended family. As a sister, daughter and aunt, Agnes was dependable and kind, her family said, and she was also funny.</p> <p>“She was always joking, smiling,” said her niece Esther Njoki. “We were always laughing because of her jokes.”</p> <p>Growing up, Agnes would look after her younger nieces, spending time braiding their hair. Later, she turned her hobby into her career; she began training to be hairdresser in 2010. She finished her course in August 2011. Just a few months later, before she had had a chance to properly start out in her new career, she was dead.</p> <p>While she completed her studies, Agnes was also heavily pregnant. Her daughter Stacey was born on 20 October that year. “Agnes’s feelings about becoming a mum was [that it was] the best feeling ever,” Esther Njoki said.</p> <p>She loved her baby daughter but struggled to provide for her, and like many young women in Nanyuki, Agnes would make extra money from selling sex. Batuk, the British army training base nearby, provided a steady flow of custom.</p> <p>Soldiers would come into Nanyuki to drink and socialise and many would pay for sex with local women, often several in one night, paying them as little as the equivalent of £1 a time.</p> <p>Agnes would go to bars in the town to meet her friends, and dance. The night she disappeared, 31 March 2012, started like many others. She went to the Lion’s Court hotel, a favourite haunt of British soldiers, to meet her friends Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.</p> <p>They remembered her joining them at about 11pm and the three women dancing together. Agnes was drinking a beer that she told her friends had been bought for her by a British soldier.</p> <p>Instead of returning home to her sister, her daughter and her niece as she had every other night, Agnes disappeared. The next morning, her friends and family had not heard from her. They went to the hotel where she had last been seen, and spent weeks searching for Agnes, until her body was discovered two months later.</p> <p>Agnes’s death has had a lasting effect on her family. Stacey was five months old when she lost her mother and will not remember her but has been deeply affected after learning how she died.</p> <p>“We have been having moments where she sees something about her mum and she breaks down,” Njoki said, “and that’s because of trauma.”</p> <p>Njoki and her mother, Rose, have carried the heavy burden of Agnes’s death for 13 years. “You just keep on thinking about Agnes, about the case, and you just feel bad,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s really traumatising, for sure, and saddening, and our hearts [are broken].”</p>",

    "description": "<ul><li><p>World champion says ‘only matter of time’ to reach 9.6sec</p></li><li><p>Seville dismisses effect of Noah Lyles’ mind games</p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>On Sunday night, Oblique Seville became the first Jamaican to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/14/oblique-seville-men-100m-final-world-athletics-championships\">win the men’s 100m world title</a> since Usain Bolt. But it turns out the 24-year-old’s mind is just as quick as his blistering leg speed.</p> <p>In an interview to celebrate his victory, Seville was asked if he were to design a sprinter what would he look like. The questioner expected a long answer. Perhaps Justin Gatlin’s start, Michael Johnson’s mentality, and Bolt’s leg speed.</p> <p>But one word came back from Seville’s mouth almost instantaneously. “Usain.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/gout-gout-world-athletics-championships-200m-heat-preview\">Time comes for Gout Gout to prove himself against sprinting’s best emerging talent | Jack Snape </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s never been anyone like him, has there?” he’s asked. “No,” Seville said. “But I would take his last part of his race and my start. Then you would have the perfect sprinter.”</p> <p>However, there is one issue that Seville disagrees with his hero about. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/i-get-out-of-breath-walking-up-the-stairs-these-days-usain-bolt-admits\">Bolt insisted the current generation did not have the talent</a> to run the 100m in the 9.6sec, like he, Yohan Blake and Tyson Gay once did. Seville, who ran a personal best of 9.77sec to win gold in Tokyo, disagreed.</p> <p>“In my opinion, it’s just only a matter of time before someone is going to run 9.6,” he said. “I don’t think we are far off in this generation. It just takes us time. Because you have to understand, it was the same back then.</p> <p>“No one was running 9.6 until Usain Bolt put his foot in Beijing. So it’s for us now, as a new generation, for us to just meet that step. To prove that we can actually do the same thing that Usain did.”</p> <p>The difference between Seville and Bolt could barely be more pronounced. Both hail from Jamaica but Bolt was 6ft 5in and weighed about 14st, and Seville is 5ft 6in and just 11st 6lb. Seville loves going to church and said he prepared for the 100m final by reading the Bible “which gave me a lot of peace of mind”. Bolt, it is fair to say, had a rather different approach.</p> <p>However, the men share the same coach: Glen Mills. And it was Mills who always believed that Seville could emulate Bolt by becoming the fastest man on the planet.</p> <p>“I realised that I was a fast kid when I was six,” said Seville. “I was running against kids that were bigger than me and I was very competitive. So I showed it at a very early age.</p> <p>“When I just started out with my coach, he said it’s going to take me a few years to get to the podium. And whatever he says, that is what’s going to happen. His words manifested upon me and here I am right now, a gold medallist.</p> <p>“He can be tough at times and he’s a good guy because he’s a very intelligent guy. And I learn a lot from him in and out of sport. He guides me mentally and shows me my career, physically.”</p> <p>Since Bolt left the sport in 2017, the crown of the world champion has slipped, light-fingered, through the hands of Gatlin, Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Noah Lyles. Could Seville, who was one of the favourites for gold in Paris, be the one that holds on to the crown? He hopes so. But he knows it will be difficult.</p> <p>“I have the mentality. But you know that injuries are a part of the sport,” said Seville. “And because of my height and size I cannot make any mistakes. I have to ensure that everything that I do is on point.”</p> <p>That mentality was also strong when the American Lyles tried to play mind games on the Jamaicans before the final. “It doesn’t have any effect on me,” said Seville. “Because over the years I realised that Noah is going to be Noah. And he’s going to talk.</p> <p>“I respect that. It’s good for the sport. It might have worked on other athletes but not me. I came to the world championship for one purpose. To win the gold.” And he did that, all right.</p>  ",

A boundary-laden cameo from Joe Clarke (29) and an unbeaten 30 from Brett Hutton apart, the visiting batsmen struggled to assert their authority.</p> <p>Fisher enjoyed his first five-wicket haul for Surrey since he moved from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> last winter. “We did what we usually do, hunt like a pack,” he said after play. “I felt like I’ve put in decent areas all season, sometimes I’m lacking that little bit of nip but I had it today.” And on watching his bowling partner: “I’m purring at mid-on watching Gus.” Ben Foakes finished with five catches.</p> <p>As the shadows spread over the ground like a rash, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley did what they do, playing a straight and steady bat. Then from nowhere, Dillon Pennington made one spit off the pitch and Sibley got a lick as it passed by. The batter threw his head back in frustration as he had to trudge back to the pavilion, out for 14 with just nine balls left.</p> <p>The high winds which delayed play around all the grounds (except the Riverside, which was affected purely by rain) did so because of the risks to ground staff and spectators in handling flat covers, including the covers lifting staff off the ground, or blowing loose and hitting the crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c922b08f084793c7c16363\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scores on the doors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>Division One</strong></h2> <p><strong>Riverside:</strong> Durham v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire\">Worcestershire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Taunton:</strong> Somerset v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire\">Hampshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>The Oval:</strong> Surrey 43-1 v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nottinghamshire\">Nottinghamshire</a> 231</p> <p><strong>Hove:</strong> Sussex v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Edgbaston:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc\">Warwickshire</a> v Essex <em> </em></p> <h2><strong>Division Two</strong></h2> <p><strong>The County Ground:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/derbyshire\">Derbyshire</a> v Glamorgan <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Bristol:</strong> Gloucestershire v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonshire\">Northamptonshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Old Trafford:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire\">Lancashire</a> v Middlesex <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Grace Road:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestershire\">Leicestershire</a> v Kent </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c7defb8f086519d3272613\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning</strong> from The Oval where the Hobbs gates are open, the sky is periwinkle, and Surrey are on top in this crucial Championship arm wrestle.

    "content": "<p>First Tokyo witnessed the spectacular. Then came a divine act of Faith.</p> <p>In the women’s 400m, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran one of the fastest times in history, easing down, to raise the question of whether one of the oldest – and most controversial – track and field records might fall later this week.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards another standout female of her generation, Faith Kipyegon, underlined her status by speeding to a historic fourth 1500m title with such grace and distance that it took the breath away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both women have long stood tall in athletics’ pantheon. What they do in the coming days could reinforce their case to be considered as the greatest female athlete of all time.</p> <p>McLaughlin-Levrone, of course, already holds numerous gold medals and world records in the 400m hurdles. But now, suddenly, she has the 400m gold and possibly even the world record of 47.60 sec set by Marita Koch in 1985 in her sights too.</p> <p>The American showed that by running 48.29 sec in Tuesday’s semi-final – smashing her personal best by nearly half a second – and then promising to run faster in Thursday’s final.</p> <p>“This race definitely gives me confidence for the final,” she said. “I didn’t expect to run this fast today. And I still have more to show.”</p> <p>That sounds ominous for Koch, who has long been alleged to be part of East Germany’s state-sponsored doping programme, in books and newspaper articles. When asked about it by the BBC in 2014, she replied: “I don’t have to prove anything to myself. I have a clear conscience. I can only repeat myself … I never tested positive, I never did anything which I should not have done at that time.”</p> <p>Koch did acknowledge the fact that the record would ultimately be overtaken, though, saying that “at some point, that time will come”. It could even be on Thursday .</p> <p>However, McLaughlin-Levrone will not have things completely her own way given that the Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and the former world champion Salwa Eid Naser are running well.</p> <p>They will be joined in the final by Britain’s Amber Anning, who ran 49.38sec to automatically qualify. “I’m in such great shape,” she insisted.</p> <p>Paulino is even more confident, promising: “God and I will make history here.”</p> <p>The 31-year-old Kipyegon has already done that. On Tuesday she matched Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four world 1500m titles.</p> <p>With 300m to go Kipyegon, who broke her own world record earlier this year, looked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/australias-jess-hull-takes-1500m-bronze-after-brave-race-against-kenya-legend-faith-kipyegon\">under threat from the Australian Jessica Hull</a>. But then she applied the afterburners and the race was put to bed long before she crossed the line in 3min 52.15sec.</p>    <p>Hull, who had promised she would give it her all and try to win gold faded badly but clung on for bronze. Another Kenyan, Dorcus Ewoi, took silver. Now Kipyegon has a moouthwatering 5,000m clash of the titans to look forward to against the 10,000m world champion, Beatrice Chebet.</p> <p>“Being able to defend my title and to win a fourth gold feels really special,” said Kipyegon, who held four fingers up as she crossed the line. “This sport drives me. I need to push myself in order to be the best.</p> <p>It was another bad night for Britain with Matt Hudson-Smith, the Olympic and world silver medallist, going out of the men’s 400m at the semi-final stage, along with Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon. Reardon pointed to a long break outside the stadium as a factor in finishing last. </p> <p>“After the first 50m I just felt the tightening of my hamstring and pain,” he said. “You warm up to get yourself ready, and when you’re delayed for that long outside in the stadium, in the elements cooling down every second. It’s not really helpful.</p> <p>To make matters worse, World Athletics also reprimanded the British team after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with ‘100% Jesus’ on it during the semi-final of the 100m. The marketing of religious and political slogans is banned during competition by the governing body’s rules.</p> <p>“We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences,” read a World Athletics statement.</p> <p>It also emerged that a group of leading athletes will consider legal action if they are not paid by the end of the September for racing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/21/michael-johnson-grand-slam-track-misses-vital-village-fete-feel-athletics\">Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track</a>. Multiple athletes are still waiting on prize money after competing in the first three rounds, before the cancellation of the planned final event in Los Angeles. Johnson did not respond when approached for comment.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there was gold for New Zealand’s Hamish Kerr in the men’s high jump and for the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">Cordell Tinch in the 110m hurdles</a>, while there was better news for Britain in the men’s 800m as Ben Pattison and Max Burgin looked comfortable in qualifying for Thursday’s semi-finals.<br><br>Burgin, who won his heat in 1:44.73, looked comfortable until just after he gave an interview to the BBC and then threw up – something he often does after races. “Standard fare for me,” he said later, smiling.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jacob Bethell is ready for England to “chuck me in the deep end” as he prepares to lead the side for the first time against Ireland on Wednesday, making him the country’s youngest men’s captain.</p> \n<p>With Harry Brook rested for this quickfire three-match Twenty20 series in Malahide, just north of Dublin, the 21-year-old steps in to continue his brisk rise in international cricket. Bethell made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/11/travis-head-helps-blast-australia-to-t20-liftoff-against-inexperienced-england\">his England debut last September</a> and impressed in his first Test series against New Zealand at the end of the year. Yet to seal a regular place in the red-ball XI, he has become an automatic pick in Brendon McCullum’s white-ball teams.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">Ireland’s near-empty cricket summer in stark contrast to England’s slate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Baz gave me a ring and said I was going to be skipper,” said Bethell. “Not a whole lot has been said of why I’ve been chosen for the role. I don’t know the exact thinking of those who are in charge. I guess it’s maybe just a bit of trust, and showing a bit of faith. It will be nice to see how I go under pressure, and I’m sure that the guys that have made the decision would like to see that as well.</p> \n<p>“I like when things come at a fast pace, it tends to get me up and about. So I like those situations, doesn’t mean that they always work. But hopefully this one does.”</p> \n<p>Even with plenty of experienced names in the squad to face Ireland, Bethell’s ascension is in line with the management’s wilder impulses when it comes to selection. He will have to fall back on his previous experience of leading England Under-19s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e30692bd-17ee-4abf-bc7f-406957216e62\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ireland&nbsp;</b>Paul Stirling (capt), Ross Adair, Lorcan Tucker (wkt), Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Ben Calitz, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Barry McCarthy, Matthew Humphreys, Craig Young</p>\n    <p><b>England&nbsp;</b>Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wkt), Jordan Cox, Jacob Bethell (capt), Sam Curran, Tom Banton, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Adil Rashid, Luke Wood, Sonny Baker</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“A very young one,” replied a smiling Bethell when asked what type of captain he is. “The main thing I’ve looked up to in captains I’ve had previously is how they manage people. Not every tactical decision you make is going to work, but it’s managing the boys well so they feel you’re backing them. I’ve got no preconceived ideas of how I’m going to be.”</p> \n<p>Bethell has found form with the bat since he was announced as captain last month, having hit his first professional century in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">third ODI against South Africa</a> less than a fortnight ago. “I didn’t play for a while and maybe lost a little bit of rhythm, but felt that rhythm come back about midway through the Hundred so it’s great to be back feeling good.” He did not get dragged into any detailed Ashes talk: “My head’s firmly screwed on to this series.”</p> \n<p>Harry Tector and Paul Stirling “are the two main threats with the bat” for Ireland, said Bethell. The hosts enter underprepared having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">not played since June</a> – a completely different story to England – and will be without the whippy left-arm pace of Josh Little, on the mend from a rib injury. Yet the only completed T20 meeting between these two sides brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/ireland-stun-england-at-t20-world-cup-to-throw-super-12s-wide-open\">an Irish victory in Melbourne</a> at the World Cup three years ago, a reminder that it may not be all smooth for Bethell over the coming days.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the wake of the Trump administration’s announcement that it will overturn the rule which underpins virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee has launched an investigation into a suspected lobbying push that led to the move.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Senate environment and public works committee sent letters to two dozen corporations, including oil giants, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations. The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/31/trump-epa-endangerment-finding\">said in July</a> that it will unmake.</p> <p>The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/oil-donations-republicans-trump-anti-environment-bill\">Republicans who backed Trump’s anti-environment bill have accepted over $105m from big oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”</p> <p>Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.</p> <p>“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.</p> <p>It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.</p> <p>Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.</p> <p>The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched, and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.</p> <p>Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/climate/epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-proposal.html\">reported</a> that groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.</p> <p>When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.</p> <p>“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.</p> <p>Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.</p> <p>“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”</p> <p>Two environmental non-profits <a href=\"https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/0kdlw6oq5v8hsvj152eqx01b0qn74uuq.pdf\">have sued the Trump administration</a> for “secretly” convening a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/climate-science-trump-administration\">climate contrarians</a> to bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.</p> <p>The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/trump-air-climate-pollution-regulation-100-days\">war on the environment</a> by the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.</p> <p>“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.</p>",

government faces new questions about its response to last week’s Russian drones incursion</strong>, amid media reports that a house in the village of Wyryki damaged that night may have been hit not by a Russian drone, but by a missile launched from a Polish fighter jet sent to intercept it.</p> \n  <p>The report, first published by <a href=\"https://www.rp.pl/wojsko/art43015001-polska-rakieta-uderzyla-w-dom-na-lubelszczyznie\">Rzeczpospolita</a> daily and later confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetwiadomosci/to-rakieta-z-polskiego-f-16-zniszczyla-dom-w-wyrykach-prezydent-reaguje/kfjvs6b,79cfc278\">Onet</a>, included <strong>a suggestion that the missile’s targeting system malfunctioned on launch, but its in-built safety system prevented it from arming and exploding.</strong></p> \n  <p>Today’s media claims prompted <strong>the National Security Bureau, reporting to the opposition-aligned president Karol Nawrocki, to urge the government to “immediately clarify” what happened.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The government’s response focused on stressing Russia’s overall responsibility for the attack,</strong> which triggered the military reaction, without focusing on the details or confirming the reporting.</p> \n  <p>Poland’s <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> did not take questions from reporters when he appeared at a media briefing announcing plans on submarine procurement earlier today, but he responded to media reports on X, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the damage to the house in Wyryki falls on the authors of the drone provocation, that is, Russia.</strong> The appropriate services will inform the public, the government, and the president about all the circumstances of the incident after the proceedings are completed.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em><strong>“Hands off Polish soldiers.”</strong></em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>My definition of a Russian sockpuppet is someone who tries to remove responsibility from Russia</strong> for the consequences of the drone provocation against Poland.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy foreign minister <strong>Marcin Bosacki</strong>, who represented Poland at the UN security council meeting on the incident last week, said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the losses resulting from the Russian provocation of sending 19 military drones into Poland falls on Russia </strong>– whether the damage was caused by the drones or by the missiles intercepting them, used IN DEFENCE by Polish and allied armed forces.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The <strong>Polish ministry of defence issued only a brief statement saying that “the relevant state authorities are conducting a full investigation</strong> into the events following Russia’s aggression.”</p> \n  <p>“<strong>However, it is already clear today that Russia is responsible for the provocation and its consequences,</strong>” it said.</p> \n  <p>It later added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Regardless of the final conclusions of the state authorities, <strong>the destroyed house in the town of Wyryki will be rebuilt at the state’s expense.</strong>”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In its statement, <strong>the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/DowOperSZ/status/1967964049133428873\">sidestepped</a> the question about what happened, insisting instead that it provided the relevant authorities with “all available information, without any omissions.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c987448f080f2d1dcf1d06\"

programme “is unlikely to be achieved” with <strong>a “disconnect” between pledges made in Brussels and what happens on the ground.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Some 32 of the world’s 44 least developed countries (LDC) are in Africa</strong>, with Haiti, the only one categorised as such in the Caribbean are with eight countries in Asia including Cambodia and two in the Pacific classed as LDCs.</p> \n  <p>An in depth investigation by the court of auditors published today looked at <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Cambodia</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It found <strong>simple issues had arisen inhibiting its efficacy including training of public servants rather than business people.</strong><br><br>In Malawi, <strong>the EU found that a programme it had backed for farmers and small businesses was not backed by local banks involved.</strong> Instead they “only gave loans to big clients they had already worked with”.</p> \n  <p>Between 2017 and 2022 the EU and its member states allocated €17.2bn through the Aid for Trade programme to the world’s least developed countries, “a fraction of the overall €105.8bn sent to other developing countries”, the court of auditors said. </p> \n  <p>It also pointed out that the share received by the least developed countries declined from 18% of the Aid for Trade programme, to just 12% in 2022.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c97e8f8f080f2d1dcf1c91\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kiran-stacey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

defence.</strong></p> \n  <p>“We are not ready for either a Russian attack or an attack by another nation,” he added. “I’ve been saying this for a long time. <strong>I think it’s our job to put this

significantly increase defence spending over the next decade, even if the policy is extremely unpopular among Italians.</p> \n  <p><strong>In 2024, Italy’s defence spending was just 1.5% of output – at the lower end of the 32 Nato members.</strong> The country has committed to increasing this to 5% by 2035.

to do so.</strong></p> \n  <p>“<strong>If you’ve got drones that are putting Polish lives at risk, then Nato will take the action to take them out,</strong>” Healey said, adding the Typhoons were part of a broader mission “to defend Nato airspace”.</p> \n  <p><strong>Over the weekend, Romania became the second Nato ally in eastern Europe to detect a Russian drone crossing into its airspace in a week</strong> – and Healey said the Typhoons mission would extend operations to the country if deemed necessary.</p> \n  <p>He said: “They are deployed as part of the Nato Eastern Sentry air policing. <strong>What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato.</strong> That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”</p> \n  <p>There was <strong>no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate.</strong> </p> \n  <p>Healey said: “<strong>There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point.</strong> It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c92a828f084793c7c163a0\"

substance, the more reforms, and this is a point I made some times, the more we push [for] reforms, the more private capital will step up and the less public money we will need.”</p> \n  <p>“Of course, <strong>this path will break longstanding taboos, but the rest of the world has already broken theirs.</strong> For Europe’s survival, <strong>we must do what has not been done before</strong>, and refuse to be held back by self imposed limits,” he says.</p> \n  <p>He stresses the EU needs to “move beyond broad strategies and back-loaded timelines,” and need “concrete dates and deliverables.”</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“European citizens are <strong>asking that their leaders raise their eyes from their daily concerns</strong> towards their common European destiny

change elsewhere,' Draghi says as he urges EU to move faster on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, <strong>Mario Draghi – of the Draghi report – is speaking now</strong> and he is not exactly as positive as von der Leyen.</p> \n  <p>He talks about <strong>the need for the EU to move faster, be more agile, and match the pace of change elsewhere.</strong></p> \n  <p>He says that having his plan means that “Europe’s citizens and companies value the diagnosis, the clear priorities and the action plans, but they also express growing frustration” with the pace of change.</p> \n  <p><strong>“</strong>They are disappointed by how slowly the EU moves. <strong>They see us failing to match the speed of change elsewhere.</strong> They are ready to act, but fear governments have not grasped the gravity of the moment,<strong>”</strong> he says.</p> \n  <p>He adds that <strong>“too often, excuses are made for our slowness,”</strong> with some portraying it as the EU’s strength or respect for the rule of law.</p> \n  <p>“I think <strong>that’s complacency.</strong> Competitors in US and China are far less constrained even when acting within the law. <strong>To carry on as usual is to resign ourselves to falling behind,</strong>” he warns.</p> \n  <p>“<strong>A different path demands new speed, scale and intensity.</strong> It means acting together, not fragmenting our efforts. It means focusing resources where impact is greatest. It means delivering results within months, not years,” he argues.</p> \n  <p>On AI, he also strikes a more cautions tone, saying that it “depends on the orchestration of at least four other technologies” in cloud, supercomputing, cybersecurity and fibre satellites.</p> \n  <p>He says that Europe is falling behind the US and China on large foundation models, and sees lower AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>He stresses that “more ambition is needed” to “remove barriers to scaling up new technologies,” as he calls for more support from member states to move faster.</p> \n  <p>Draghi also takes about the AI Act being “another source of uncertainty,” suggesting that the next stage of codes of practice on high risk AI systems should be “paused until we better understand the drawbacks” as he called for “ex post” assessment to drive enforcement.</p> \n  <p>On industrial policies needed to respond to the rise of economic nationalism and protectionism, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“States are using every tool at their disposal to advance their interests. <strong>So far, Europe’s response has fallen into two traps, uncoordinated national efforts or blind faith that market force will build new structures.</strong> The first can never deliver scale. The second is impossible when others distort markets and tilt the level playing field.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><em>Ouch, ouch, ouch.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c919958f0807088ffe78cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:10:05.436Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU's von der Leyen praises bloc's progress on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As I mentioned earlier, <strong>the EU’s von der Leyen is speaking now in Brussels on “one year after the Draghi report.”</strong></p> \n  <p>Painting a rather rosy picture, she argues that <strong>Europe “is not only a challenger, but a leader in many fields that will define that race” on innovation,</strong> including computing power and AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>She insists that <strong>Europe “is not playing catch up”</strong> like it was during the rise of the Internet, but is “among the frontrunners.”</p> \n  <p>But on a slightly more critical tone, she says that <strong>Europe “needs to capitalise on our strengths”</strong> as she pointed out that the bloc’s “single market is far from being completed” and this needs to change to help companies grow.</p> \n  <p><strong>“It should not be easier to find a fortune across an ocean than across a European border, and we have started to address these barriers,”</strong> she says, stressing plans to progress reforms by 2028.</p> \n  <p>She also <strong>talks about the progress on cleaner energy</strong>, even as she admits that “our energy prices remain still far too high, too volatile, too disparate across Europe” with more to be done on interconnectors and grids across the continent.</p> \n  <p><strong>Von der Leyen also talks about the need to reduce Europe’s dependencies,</strong> particularly on China. “With the right policies, we can shore up our security,” she says.</p> \n  <p><em>I’ll keep monitoring her speech for key lines.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c918138f0807088ffe78c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:02:12.817Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 3,500 drones launched at Ukraine this month, Zelenskyy says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> <strong>Zelenskyy said that Russia has launched more than 3,500 drones and nearly 190 missiles against Ukraine so far this month.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>“There have also been provocations against our partners,”</strong> he said on X, refering to recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania.</p> \n  <p>“This is <strong>precisely the kind of aerial terror against which Ukraine is calling for joint defence</strong> – so that no one has to scramble combat aircraft in haste and feel Russia’s pressure on their borders.”</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Now is <strong>the time to implement the joint protection of our European skies</strong> with a multi-layered air defense system. </em></p> \n   <p><em>All the technologies for this are already in place.

    "description": "<p>Videos of frontman Ken Casey confronting rightwing provocateurs at the band’s gigs have gone viral, attracting new fans and new safety worries. He wants to lower the temperature – and see other bands speaking out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Backstage at the Rock la Cauze festival in Victoriaville, Canada, where Boston punk-rock institution Dropkick Murphys are headlining, founding bassist/singer Ken Casey is experiencing an uncharacteristic moment of anxiety.</p> <p>“We have concerns about going back over the border tonight,” he says, gravely – not for the illicit reasons touring musicians usually fear border crossings, but because Casey’s regular on stage rants against Donald Trump have gone viral. “We’re not worried about being arrested,” he adds. “But we have a show in New York tomorrow. Are we gonna get harassed or held up? We used to come over that border and they’d be, ‘Dropkicks! Come right through!’ But what’s it going to be like now?”</p> <p>By “now”, Casey means during the second Trump presidency, which has brought the political element always present within Dropkick Murphys’ bolshie, Pogues and Clash-influenced bruisers to the fore. The group’s resistance has found its sharpest expression at their shows, where their anthem <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=first+class+loser+dropkick+murphys&amp;oq=first+clas&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgoIARAuGLEDGIAEMgoIAhAAGLEDGIAEMgYIAxBFGDkyCggEEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBggHEEUYPdIBCDIxMTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:8c8bcc3d,vid:AjvNrF-v8AY,st:0\">First Class Loser</a> is accompanied by videos depicting Trump and former chum Jeffrey Epstein, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4ggwyWEMI\">Casey’s skirmishes with a vocal minority of Maga Dropkicks fans</a> in the mosh pit have lit up social media. He admits these fans often provoke the worst in him. “How do you know if someone’s in a cult? They hold up a hat all fuckin’ night,” he rages in one clip.</p> <p>“People tell me, ‘You didn’t use-ta soapbox like this’,” he says on our video call, gathering steam. “Well, we didn’t use-ta be in the midst of an authoritarian takeover!”</p> <p>Dropkick Murphys are still commanding big blue-collar crowds as they approach their 30th anniversary in 2026. Over the years they’ve scored numerous US Top 10 albums, Bruce Springsteen collaborations and a platinum-seller in the form of civic anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw\">I’m Shipping Up to Boston</a>, boosted by its appearance in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed. But their value system, Casey says, hasn’t changed since the now seven-strong band formed with the aim “to be a voice for working people”. Class and the labour movement are key to the 56-year-old’s identity. “My father died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandfather, a labour organiser who instilled in me the value of a union. In the Boston suburb where I was raised, everyone owed their lives to a union job. It put a roof over our head.”</p>    <p>The Boston of Casey’s youth was heavily Irish-American. “The English love to call us ‘plastic paddies’, but I’ve never thought of myself as Irish – I’m <em>Boston</em> Irish, the people that fought against the most Wasp-y, keep-the-Irish-down place that ever existed,” he says, referring to how Irish refugees fleeing the great famine of 19th-century were targeted by anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant groups and scorned by the English Protestant Puritans who had settled America. “To go from those trenches to positions of power in city hall, on the railroad and in the utility companies led to my generation being able to have the middle-class life.”</p> <p>He pauses for a second, but he’s not finished: Casey would make a great labour organiser himself. “When that’s your story, you need to be willing to aid the culture that’s coming next. One immigrant culture can’t close the door behind them, especially not in America. We’re all immigrants here.”</p> <p>A tearaway in his youth, Casey quit drink and drugs before he reached 21, “because otherwise I’d be in prison,” he says. “I had a big problem as a teen.” He ploughed his energies into the hardcore punk scene surrounding Boston venue the Rathskeller, AKA the Rat. “Punk-rock was the soundtrack to my friggin’ mayhem. I was a rebellious kid, I liked the underdog vibe.” In 1996, now booking shows at the Rat, a co-worker bet him $30 he “didn’t have the balls to start a band on three weeks’ notice”. Never one to back down from a wager, Casey formed Dropkick Murphys.</p> <p>His identity was stamped all over the group. Before they even used Celtic instrumentation – the Dropkicks are the rare punk band to field a bagpiper – he says the embryonic Dropkicks “sounded like [1960s Irish folk group] the Clancy Brothers meets the Ramones – the delivery, the melodies, the lyrical content. It just naturally poured out of me.”</p> <p>Their beginnings were hardscrabble: pressing their own singles, booking their own shows and touring in an old Boston transit bus, for reasons of poverty and pride. “We peeled the roof off under a low bypass,” he grins. “We toured for two more years with that roof open like a convertible. When it rained, I held an umbrella over the driver.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d8SzG4FPyM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9d8SzG4FPyM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Dropkick Murphys: Rose Tattoo – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>By the 21st century, they had become staples of the US punk-rock circuit, their annual St Patrick’s Day shows among Boston’s hottest tickets, performing and recording with their heroes. “We play Billy Bragg’s There Is Power in a Union over the PA every night before we go on stage,” Casey says. “He opened our St Patrick’s show last year with it and then played Worker’s Song with us. Afterwards, he said, ‘I felt like I was in the fuckin’ Clash for three minutes!’” Springsteen, another member of the Dropkicks’ extended family, recorded their Rose Tattoo for a charity single after the Boston Marathon bombing, and sang Peg O’ My Heart with Dropkicks in Boston, “back when my grandmother Peg was still alive”, says Casey. “He came on with her for the encore – we had to pry her off Bruce’s arm to get her off the stage. I’m almost shocked a guy of that level was so down-to-earth. But he’s always had an affinity with punk. Bruce still walks the talk.”</p> <p>“Walking the talk” matters to the Dropkicks; their merch is made in the US by union-approved manufacturers, while their <a href=\"https://www.claddaghfund.org/\">Claddagh Fund</a> supports non-profit organisations across Boston. “We were pretty beloved in our city, whether people liked our music or not, because we gave a lot back to the community,” Casey says. Not any more, however. “Now a lot of people in my circles say ‘Fuck Dropkick Murphys’,” he adds, lantern jaw clenching. “Although never to my face. They despise me and the band.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s clear that, for Casey, the political is personal. His sense of betrayal regarding “the many rank-and-file union members who are now Trump voters” is palpable. “They don’t think Trump’s coming for the unions, but he’s coming for the unions, trust me. I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. It’s about total control for the rich. It’s class war.”</p> <p>What is the magic spell Trump has managed to cast over a demographic who were until recently, Casey says, “in lockstep with Dropkicks’ beliefs”? “Trump offered them a chance to say out loud things people used to have to whisper to their friends,” Casey spits. “Racism, cruelty, jokes about disabilities. A lot of white people in America believed whites will not be in control any more, especially after Obama. This is their last, desperate grasp to hold control.”</p> <p>The Dropkicks have met this grim moment with records that have transformed their previously cartoonish riot music into something more sober, biting and heartfelt. Two acoustic albums – 2022’s This Machine Still Kills Fascists and 2023’s Okemah Rising – set unrecorded Woody Guthrie polemics to their music. “Woody’s grandson Cole told his mom Nora, ‘Grandpa would’ve liked these guys’,” Casey beams proudly. “It made us better musicians, doing it all acoustic. But that left us with a hunger to go electric and be a punk-rock band again.” Which brings us to this year’s <a href=\"https://www.kerrang.com/album-review-dropkick-murphys-for-the-people\">For the People</a>, which opens with Who’ll Stand With Us? A key lyric: “The working people fuel the engine / While you yank the chain.”</p>    <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrxVX3iNvhY\">viral clip from a recent show</a>, Casey bets a fan in a Maga shirt $100 that it wasn’t manufactured in the US; it was, inevitably, manufactured in Nicaragua, and Casey swapped the offending garment for a union-made Dropkicks T-shirt.</p> <p>“If America is ever going to go back to some semblance of normal, we have to bring the temperature down, we need to be able to talk to each other,” Casey says, referencing that night. “I talked to that guy afterwards, and he said, ‘I don’t let politics get in the way of family, and I consider you family’. I could have jumped down his throat, but he seemed open to reason.” He pauses. “That’s rare for Maga, though. Other days, I’m like, ‘Fuck this, I don’t even want to know these people, if this is how they think and behave’. Do I want to have a dialogue with these people? No. I’m just hoping the fever will break. I don’t need them to have a ‘come to Jesus’ moment on the difference between right and wrong – I just need them not to support what’s happening.”</p> <p>Does he fear blowback for his outspokenness, like that suffered by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/-late-show-stephen-colbert-wins-emmy-cbs-cancellation-rcna231276\">Stephen Colbert</a> – or worse?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/21/deftones-singer-chino-moreno-ive-got-hundreds-of-drawings-of-myself-in-my-house\">Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unlike Stephen, we have no parent company, so we can say what we want,” he says. “Regarding our safety … whatever,” he snarls, disdainfully. “I’ll never have a security guard or anything like that. But you gotta keep your head on a swivel a little bit. Back in the day, we always had a Nazi element gunning for us, but you could see them coming. Now you don’t know who’s who. I’m not sure what’s keeping other people quiet, though, especially in punk-rock. Where’d everyone go? They had the balls to speak out against Bush back in the day. But Bush didn’t have an army of trolls that come after you. Speaking out against Bush wasn’t going to cost you half your fanbase, potentially.”</p> <p>In his darker moments, Casey reckons “within a year, this country’s gonna fall on its face, and people are gonna feel the pain: recession, inflation, unemployment. There’s nobody coming to save us.” He says he feels “no excitement or happiness” in the group’s anti-Trump screeds winning them newfound fame. “But maybe there’s a slight sense of validation,” he adds. “I talk to the fans every night. One night, an immigrant told me, ‘I moved here, and my partner is American, we have children, and I live in fear of being deported. My own friends have turned on me, they say I’m taking American jobs.’ He was actually in tears at the end. But he said, ‘I feel like someone is speaking on my behalf’. From the earliest days of this band, we wanted to be involved in something that mattered. So we are. I wish it was a different subject and not quite so important, but …”</p> <p>He sighs. Maybe the border tonight will be a shitshow, but it won’t change how the Dropkicks operate in this darkest of moments. “We’re sticking our neck out and getting a lot of negative attention,” he adds. “But if we don’t do it now, it might be too late.”</p> <p>• For the People is out now on Dummy Luck Music/PIAS. <a href=\"https://dropkickmurphys.com/tour/\">Dropkick Murphys’ European tour</a> begins 15 October at Alcatraz, Milan</p>",

    "description": "<p>‘Sobering and concerning’ that Axel Rudakubana had searched X for Australia knife attack, inquiry told</p>",
    "content": "<p>A lawyer said it was “sobering and concerning” that the Southport attacker probably viewed footage on social media of a stabbing in Australia by a teenage boy just 40 minutes before carrying out his own crimes.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.southport.public-inquiry.uk/\">inquiry is being held</a> into the circumstances and events leading up to the attack by Axel Rudakubana, then 17, on 29 July 2024 in which he murdered three young girls and attempted to murder eight children and two adults.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the inquiry, outlined what would be explored and the questions that would be asked during the course of the inquiry, being held at Liverpool town hall.</p> <p>Moss said a notable feature of the “extremely cowardly” attack was that it was “specifically targeting women and girls”.</p> <p>He said the inquiry would establish a timeline of Rudakubana’s history and “interactions with various state systems including criminal justice, education, social care and healthcare”.</p> <p>Questions will also be asked of Rudakubana’s parents and of the social media companies Meta and X.</p> <p>Moss referred to Rudakubana as AR throughout his submission, and described him as a “prolific internet user”.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that the teenager had deleted his browsing history on his laptop before carrying out his crimes. But evidence showed he used another tablet to search on X for a knife attack by a teenage boy on a bishop in Australia.</p>    <p>The search led him to posts on X likely to have shown the actual act of stabbing, Moss said.</p> <p>“The inquiry has made a statement request of X about the fact that the act of a stabbing would have been viewable on its platform apparently to a 17-year-old boy,” he said.</p> <p>“It might, perhaps, be thought to be both sobering and concerning, in terms of online harms, that almost the last thing AR did before committing these dreadful crimes was to search for, and possibly view, material on Twitter in relation to a stabbing carried out by another boy aged under 18.”</p> <p>Moss said Meta, which owns Instagram, and X had been asked for “information about AR’s use of their platforms and we await their substantive responses”.</p> <p>Rudakubana travelled by taxi from his home in Banks to a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance class for children in Southport, where he committed his crimes. The inquiry was shown the pink-coloured advert for the class, which was “bound to appeal more to girls than boys”, Moss said.</p> <p>Apart from one man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/man-stabbed-tackling-southport-killer-scene-horror-jonathan-hayes\">injured in the attack</a>, it was a “notable feature” that all the other victims were female, he continued.</p> <p>The killer was jailed for life with a minimum term of 52 years in January at Liverpool crown court, after admitting the murders and attempted murders, described in court as “sadistic”.</p> <p>One part of the inquiry will be Rudakubana’s internet use and purchase of weapons, posing as an adult and using a false name. Moss said: “AR’s purchase of weapons is important because it will highlight vulnerabilities in the law against the purchase of knives, crossbows and machetes.”</p> <p>Rudakubana also bought seeds through Amazon, which he used to make a “crude preparation of ricin”, Moss said.</p> <p>He said the inquiry had requested detailed statements from Rudakubana’s parents “and will seek to explore their awareness of AR’s online orders and the items that AR stored in his bedroom and the living room of their home”.</p> <p>A central theme of the inquiry would be which bodies or agencies “took ownership” for intervening to address the risks that Rudakubana had demonstrated in his behaviour before the crimes.</p> <p>Before Moss spoke, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Adrian Fulford, promised to do everything “humanly possible” to answer the questions of bereaved families and victims.</p> <p>On Monday, the inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/southport-attack-inquiry-hears-parents-memories-of-their-daughters\">heard harrowing testimony</a> from the parents of the three murdered girls – Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.</p> <p>Impact evidence has also been heard from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/girl-saved-sisters-life-by-shielding-her-from-southport-attacker-inquiry-hears\">families of the other children</a> present on the day and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-dance-teachers\">injured adults</a>.</p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The claim is central to rationales for arming Israel even as leading human rights groups decry genocide in Gaza</p>",
    "content": "<p>More than nine months after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza\">Human Rights Watch</a> issued reports that concluded Israel was committing genocide – and more than a month since key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/28/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-say-israel-based-human-rights-groups\">Israeli human rights groups asserted</a> the same – the American political establishment remains in rigid denial while horrors continue nonstop in Gaza. Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats in Congress still support massive US arms shipments to Israel, so they certainly can’t admit that the weaponry is making genocide possible.</p> <p>Central to rationales for arming Israel is the claim that it is the nation of “the Jewish people”.</p> <p>When the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke via video to a conference in Jerusalem three months ago, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=gw27xba40xE\">declared</a>: “There can be no nuanced separation of hatred of Israel and hatred of the Jewish people.” Rubio added: “Those who call for the destruction of Israel are calling for the destruction of the Jewish people.” Last month, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, reinforced the same message while visiting Israel, where he reportedly <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-08-04/ty-article/.premium/u-s-house-speaker-says-west-bank-rightful-property-of-jewish-people-at-settler-confab/00000198-7541-d3a7-af9e-776713fe0000\">said</a> that the West Bank is “the rightful property of the Jewish people”.</p> <p>Such rhetoric – equating Israel with all Jews and Israel’s future with theirs – is an effort to sanctify Israel and shield it from criticism by brandishing the charge of antisemitism.</p> <p>Fusing Israel with “the Jewish people” is a key propaganda technique. The fact that it’s so ubiquitous makes it no less ridiculous, or dangerous. A comment attributed to Voltaire applies: “As long as people believe in absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities.”</p> <p>And atrocities continue with no end in sight. Israel <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-182-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem\">has persisted</a> with methodical – and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/01/gaza-israeli-killings-of-palestinians-seeking-food-are-war-crimes\">clearly intentional</a> – killing of Palestinian civilians not only with bombs, missiles and bullets but also with <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israels-use-starvation-weapon-war-has-pushed-gaza-breaking-point\">starvation as a weapon of war</a>. Blockage or <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/september/israels-siege-now-blocks-83-of-food-aid-reaching-gaza-new-data-reveals\">extreme constriction</a> of humanitarian aid has been the norm. All summer, Israel has ignored the United Nations <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164076\">warning</a> issued in June that food intake in Gaza had dropped far below “survival” level. By then, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq0gy82wjo\">said</a> conditions there had become worse than “hell on earth”.</p> <p>Ironically, the country that we’re told is the ultimate target of antisemitism is now, in reality, the world’s most powerful <em>cause </em>of antisemitism. By insisting that it is the embodiment of Jews all over the world, the state of Israel seeks to associate Jews everywhere with its systematic <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-ehud-olmert-thinks-his-country-is-committing-war-crimes\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/opinion/israel-gaza-holocaust-genocide-palestinians.html\">genocide</a> in Gaza along with <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/attacks-on-palestinians-intensifying-in-occupied-west-bank-un-rights\">deadly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-ethnic-cleansing-forced-displacements-gaza-human-rights-watch-rcna180098\">ethnic cleansing</a> of Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/03/tragedy-foretold-and-stain-our-collective-humanity-special-rapporteur-warns\">in the West Bank</a>.</p> <p>The Israeli government, esteemed by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n90g6v9qo\">dwindling number</a> of Americans, conflates itself with Judaism and “the Jewish people” in a marketing pattern so familiar that it blends into the wallpaper of media echo chambers. The crux of pro-Israel messaging is to promote a set of false equations: Israel = Jews. Support for Israel = support for Jews. Denunciations of Israel = antisemitism. And a functional subtext of those equations is this one: Israeli government = impunity.</p> <p>During the 1980s, when activists in the United States and elsewhere targeted apartheid South Africa with non-violent campaigns for boycotts, divestment and sanctions, those actions did not provoke charges of being anti-white. In this century, the nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has targeted Israel, a country condemned as an apartheid state by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution\">one</a> human rights organization after <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid\">another</a> after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/\">another</a> – and BDS supporters, even if Jewish, routinely face accusations of antisemitism. In Congress, the accusers include many liberal Democrats. The American Jewish Committee is one of many sizable groups that have long been <a href=\"https://www.ajc.org/news/bds-is-antisemitic\">flatly declaring</a> that “BDS is antisemitic”.</p> <p>Six decades ago, as a child going to Hebrew school, I couldn’t have imagined that the Jewish faith and reverence for Israel would become so manipulated. When I asked neighbors to put coins into a blue-and-white can so more trees could be planted in Israel, little did I know that the Israeli government would relentlessly kill, maim and terrorize Palestinian civilians in the name of protecting Jews. Nor did I have any inkling that the dignity and spirituality of Judaism would be twisted and desecrated by Israel with policies of genocide.</p> <p>One of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/\">Basic Laws</a>, enacted in 2018, says: “the State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people,” adding: “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” This is codification of standard assertions from the Israeli government and its ardent boosters doing all they can to hijack Judaism – claiming to speak for the world’s Jews, whether they like it or not.</p> <p>Increasingly, they don’t. <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-american-jews-are-turning-away-israel\">Polling</a> shows <a href=\"https://jcpa.org/survey-among-american-jews-over-51-support-for-bidens-decision-to-withhold-arms-shipments-to-israel/\">major opposition</a> to core Israeli policies among Jewish people in the US.</p> <p>All too often, US government officials amplify the senseless trope that Israel is the guarantor of safety for Jews worldwide. Speaking at a Hanukkah party at the White House in December 2023, former president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/user-clip-were-there-no-israel-there-wouldnt-be-a-jew-in-the-world-that-is-safe/5097513\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, there wouldn’t be a Jew in the world that is safe.” The remarkable assertion, which met with loud applause and cheers, was hardly a one-off. Three months earlier, Biden had <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-roundtable-discussion-with-jewish-community-leaders\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It’s the only ultimate guarantee.”</p> <p>The US Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, writes in his new book Antisemitism in America: “There is a special and almost indescribable pride that comes from knowing, despite all the horrors, that after two millennia of wandering the desert, the Jewish people would finally return home.” It’s a classic conceit of claiming to speak for “the Jewish people” and insisting that Israel is their actual homeland – no matter where they live on the planet.</p> <p>The biggest Jewish organizations in the US automatically extol the Israeli government, regardless of what it does. And, as Peter Beinart <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/opinion/israel-state-jewish.html\">wrote</a> this year: “American Jewish leaders don’t just insist on Israel’s right to exist. They insist on its right to exist as a Jewish state. They cling to the idea that it can be both Jewish and democratic despite the basic contradiction between legal supremacy for one ethno-religious group and the democratic principle of equality under the law.”</p> <p>More insidious is the unspoken assumption that, after all is said and done, Jewish lives are intrinsically much more valuable than other lives in general and Palestinian lives in particular, while Israel’s destiny is transcendent. It’s a mindset that Beinart decries in his new book Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: “No matter how many Palestinians die, they do not tip the scales, because the value of a Palestinian is finite and the value of a Jewish state is infinite … Worshipping a country that elevates Jews over Palestinians replaces Judaism’s universal God – who makes special demands on Jews but cherishes all people – with a tribal deity that considers Jewish life precious and Palestinian life cheap.”</p> <p>Such worshipping of Israel fuels the pernicious concept that “the Jewish people” are synonymous with Israel. Any such claim can only be destructive, especially with Israel shamelessly engaged in ethnic cleansing, mass murder and genocide.</p> <ul> <li><p>Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

He was also booked in connection with images on his cellphone depicting child abuse, said state authorities, who took Zinn into custody after he was released from a hospital that was treating him for a medical condition.</p> <p>Documents filed in Zinn’s case by UVU campus police allege that he began screaming, “I shot him – now shoot me,” in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s killing at Utah Valley University (UVU) on 10 September. Video of officers holding Zinn down was widely circulated online, leading some to believe that authorities had quickly arrested a suspect in the killing of the conservative political activist.</p> <p>Then, when asked by an officer where the gun used to kill Kirk was, Zinn allegedly replied: “I am not going to tell you.” Police contend that Zinn subsequently admitted that he was not the shooter and did not know who was – and he purportedly claimed that he had acted how he did to draw attention away from the real killer in hopes of becoming “a martyr” for Kirk.</p> <p>Zinn was later brought to a hospital and told officers he was “glad he said he shot the individual so the real suspect could get away”, according to police documents.</p> <p>He allegedly was reluctant to let investigators look at his phone, saying he used the device “to look at child sexual abuse material”, local sheriff’s deputies wrote in a separate report, as the Utah news outlet <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/51373320/man-claimed-to-shoot-charlie-kirk-to-draw-attention-from-the-real-shooter-police-say\">KSL</a> noted. A search of Zinn’s phone allegedly confirmed there were more than 20 images depicting child abuse, including of minors believed to be about 5 years old – as well as explicit messages about sexual acts.</p> <p>Ultimately, authorities arrested Zinn on counts of obstruction of justice linked to the aftermath of Kirk’s killing and sexual exploitation of a minor for the alleged content on his phone.</p> <p>Police announced the arrest of Kirk’s actual suspected killer on Friday after a two-day manhunt. He has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, of Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles south of UVU.</p> <p>Zinn has a history of criminal charges and convictions in Utah over the previous three decades,<a href=\"https://ksltv.com/local-news/utah-man-who-falsely-claimed-he-shot-charlie-kirk-booked-into-jail/819948/\"> according to KSL</a> and other local media reports. Notably, in 2013, he was arrested on allegations that he asked Salt Lake City, Utah, marathon organizers if he could help set up bombs at the finish line.</p> <p>The deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds of others had been days earlier.</p> <p>Citing information from a district attorney whose office had previously prosecuted him, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Zinn was “politically conservative, leaning libertarian”.</p> <p>On Monday, a judge ordered Zinn be held without bail, according to online court records. Robinson is expected in court Tuesday to face formal murder charges.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/young-climate-activists-lawsuit-trump-fossil-fuels",
    "description": "<p>Group of activists, who range in age from seven to 25, include plaintiffs who won landmark climate case in Montana two years ago</p>",
    "content": "<p>Youth climate activists are taking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> to court this week over its anti-environment agenda.</p> <p>In a two-day hearing in Missoula, Montana, starting Tuesday, the young activists, who are between seven and 25, will argue that a federal judge should block three of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump’s</a> pro-fossil fuel executive orders.</p> <p>The hearing, which follows the filing of litigation in May, will mark the first time a federal court hears live testimony in a youth-led constitutional climate case.</p> <p>The lawsuit specifically targets executive orders declaring a “national energy emergency” and aiming to “unleash American energy”, and another April order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the most polluting and costliest fossil fuel. Those actions, they will say, constitute unlawful executive overreach and violate the state-created danger doctrine, a legal principle meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens.</p> <p>“At a time when we need to reduce fossil fuel reliance, the federal government is actively setting us back with these executive orders designed to unleash fossil fuels,” Georgi Fischer, a plaintiff in the case, told the Guardian. “It’s incredibly important for us to fight back against these unconstitutional attacks on our rights to life and liberty.”</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment, as well as the six agencies named as defendants. Alyse Sharpe, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, said: “We don’t comment on litigation.”</p> <p>The litigation was filed by non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order\">notched a landmark win</a> in the lawsuit Held v Montana, when a judge ruled that Montana’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated a group of youth plaintiffs’ rights under the state’s constitution. Some plaintiffs in the new federal litigation, including Fischer, were also challengers in the Montana case.</p> <p>“If the Held v Montana case taught me anything, it’s that our voices and stories can be incredibly powerful and so I’m hoping the court listens to us and understands how our lives and our futures are being harmed by these unconstitutional executive orders,” Fischer said.</p> <p>During the hearing this week, some of the plaintiffs will speak. They will be joined on the stand by five expert witnesses and six fact witnesses, including Columbia environmental economist Geoffrey Heal, Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor Mark Jacobson, global ecology expert Steven Running, and John Podesta, former White House senior advisor on clean energy under Joe Biden.</p> <p>“I’m proud to speak on behalf of these young plaintiffs about the devastating impact of these executive orders,” Podesta said in a statement. “The plaintiffs make a compelling case that these orders will only make the climate crisis worse, putting at risk the health, safety, and economic well-being of these young people as well as their families and communities.”</p> <p>The federal government will not call any witnesses.</p> <p>Last month, the federal government moved to dismiss the youth plaintiffs’ case. In an unusual move, Montana and a coalition of 18 other states plus Guam also called for <a href=\"https://www.publicjustice.net/states-guam-intervene-climate-lawsuit-trump-adminstration-fossil-fuels-executive-orders/\">the lawsuit’s dismissal.</a></p> <p>The lawsuit could face an uphill battle in court. A previous federal climate lawsuit filed by Our Children’s Trust ended in a denial from the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032425zor_q8l1.pdf?ref=climateinthecourts.com\">supreme court this year</a> after being filed a decade earlier.</p> <p>“These are always uphill battles, especially under a Trump administration determined to tilt the scales toward fossil fuels, but the constitution is clear: no president can sacrifice children’s rights and futures to prop up one industry,” said Mat dos Santos, Our Children’s Trust’s general counsel. “A victory would mean that even presidential power has limits, especially when children’s lives, health, and futures are at stake.”</p>",

I’ve worked so hard for it this year so I was able to hold on in that last 20m or so.”</p> <p>Like she did in her semi-final, Hull started the race behind the pack.

Reece Holder also had a valiant showing in the men’s 400m, finishing third in his semifinal but not quite delivering one of the two next fastest times that would have booked him a place in the final.</p> <p>After four days of competition, Australia has won two medals, both bronze, and sit 22nd in the medal tally. Victory in the men’s high jump by Olympic champion Hamish Kerr gave New Zealand their second gold, and their 14-strong team is now fourth in the medal tally behind only the United States, Kenya and Canada.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/nicholas-grimshaws-architecture-eden-project",
    "description": "<p>As well as the Eden Project, Grimshaw’s ambitious and audacious work on railway stations, airports, sports complexes and supermarkets could elevate even the most mundane experience</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/eden-project-architect-nicholas-grimshaw-dies-aged-85\">Eden Project architect Nicholas Grimshaw dies aged 85 – news</a> <br></p>",
    "content": "<p>‘I asked for the eighth wonder of the world and I got it,” declared Tim Smit, co-founder of the Eden Project designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, who has died at 85. In a Cornish china clay quarry, a cluster of geodesic domes resembling monumental soap bubbles enclose conservatories housing luxuriant plant eco-systems. Completed in 2000, it was one of Grimshaw’s most ambitious and audacious projects, seemingly springing from the mind of a science fiction novelist rather than an architect.</p> <p>But however thrillingly futuristic Grimshaw’s buildings appeared, they were grounded by an avid interest in engineering and craft, and how historic precedents could be transformed and adapted for the modern era. Instead of using glass for the Eden Project’s domes, Grimshaw employed gossamer-light foil cushions.</p> <p>When passenger rail services through the Channel tunnel first began operating in 1994, the British end was marked by a new international terminus at London’s Waterloo Station. Grimshaw conjured a radical reimagining of the Victorian iron and glass train shed that his 19th-century predecessors would immediately recognise. The inspiration for the roof’s asymmetrical arched form, a design feat made all the more complex by being curved on plan, was the skeleton of a human hand. Intricately pin-jointed to accommodate the deflection imposed by trains, a glazed roof vault encased platforms in a delicately transparent cocoon. Underneath, a sleek, airport-style concourse whisked passengers up to the platform.</p>    <p>Though it endured a forlorn period after Eurostar switched its operations to St Pancras in 2007, it has since been incorporated back into the main station as part of a major refurbishment, so that commuters heading for the home counties can experience the same frisson as those original Paris-bound adventurers.</p> <p>Hi-tech architecture was often calculated to appear at its best in a mechanistic, depopulated state, but Grimshaw’s output of stations, airports, trade fair halls, sports complexes and even the odd supermarket, civilised and elevated the everyday experience of catching a train or going shopping.</p>    <p>Part aircraft carrier, part aircraft hangar, Sainsbury’s Camden superstore (1988) was a muscular, metallic armature that brought a touch of Mad Max to the weekly shop. Grimshaw even designed a new kind of ramped travelator that locked on to shopping trolleys to convey customers down to the basement car park. It was characteristic of his attention to detail and confidence in technology to solve the most quotidian of problems.</p> <p>Early standout projects included Oxford Ice Rink (1984), a daring, column-free structure suspended by a cat’s cradle of cables from two towering masts and clad in silver panels more commonly used in cold stores. The Financial Times print works (1988) invigorated a bleak part of London’s terraforming Docklands by putting the<strong> </strong><em>ballet mécanique</em> of newspaper production on public view inside an immaculately engineered glass box. Passersby could watch the FT emerge each day in a Heath Robinson-style tableau of whirring machinery and pink newsprint.</p>    <p>Commissioned to design the British Pavilion for the 1992 Seville Expo, Grimshaw devised an elegant, modular structure topped by a rippling cockscomb of solar panels. These provided the energy to power a wall of water which cooled the pavilion and its visitors in Seville’s searing summer heat. The headquarters for the Western Morning News (1993) was conceived as a futuristic galleon in full sail on a hillside outside Plymouth, while in Berlin, the Ludwig Erhard Haus (1998), designed to house the reunified city’s Chamber of Commerce, was suspended from a ribcage of parabolic steel arches, hoisted into position as theatrically as the timber frames of a medieval barn.</p> <p>Railway stations were a recurring theme. After the success of Waterloo, Grimshaw went on to revitalise London’s Paddington (1999), stripping away accumulated accretions to reveal the engineering puissance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Latterly, towards the end of his career, his firm was given the herculean task of sorting out London Bridge, once described by John Betjeman as “the most complicated, muddled and unwelcoming of all London termini”. Where there was dinginess and disorder there is now clarity and connection, expressed in a cavernous new concourse and a concerto of escalators and lifts. Even Betjeman might be able to find his way around.</p>    <p>Another much larger London infrastructure project, the Elizabeth Line, won last year’s RIBA Stirling prize, shared with design team collaborators Maynard, Equation and AtkinsRéalis. “Descending into the colossal network of tunnels feels like entering a portal to the future, where the typical commuter chaos is transformed into an effortless experience,” said RIBA president Muyiwa Oki.</p> <p>Grimshaw was always keen to point out that technology evolves and circumstances change, but the trick is to produce architecture that is agile and adaptable. This was perhaps most persuasively demonstrated by the successful 2019 remodelling of the Herman Miller furniture factory to house the Bath Schools of Art and Design. Originally completed in 1976, when Grimshaw was in partnership with Terry Farrell, the archetypal slick industrial shed is now another kind of factory, an incubator for the processes of creation, making, experimentation and learning, showing that buildings could – and should – have second lives.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Giddy romantic fantasy sends its two commitment-phobe leads on a magical road trip through their pasts that may lead them back to love</p>",
    "content": "<p>Korean-American auteur <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3226379/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1\">Kogonada</a> has until now been known for his intriguingly complex, cerebral essayistic movies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/05/columbus-review-kogonada-john-cho\">Columbus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/21/after-yang-review-what-to-do-when-your-ai-robot-child-goes-wrong\">After Yang</a>, whose emotional content, though potent, isn’t immediately obvious. Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars. This is a musical without musical numbers (without its own musical numbers, anyway) and a romantic comedy mostly without comedy – an imbalance it shares with most romcoms in fact. The screenwriter is Seth Reiss, co-author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/the-menu-review-ralph-fiennes-celeb-chef-horror-comedy-cooks-nasty-surprises\">the (much chillier) drama The Menu</a>, with Ralph Fiennes as a scary chef.</p> <p>What Kogonada and Reiss are offering is a likably, if obtusely uncynical, heart-on-sleeve wish-fulfilment spectacular, which gradually retreats from its initial, borderline insufferable self-awareness. Or maybe it’s just that you get used to it. We are plunged into a woozy daydream as multicoloured as a ball pit in a kids’ play centre, all about love, relationships and the overwhelming importance of being open and risking emotional hurt to find the One. This involves coming to terms with your past and how you feel about your passionately remembered parents who are either dead or at any rate don’t tactlessly appear on screen in their present elderly form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoRfTjfh91o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YoRfTjfh91o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell play Sarah and David, two mind-blowingly attractive single professionals who meet and warily flirt at the wedding of mutual friends; when Sarah’s rental car breaks down afterwards, they wind up sharing David’s and go on a road trip together away from unhappy commitment-phobia and towards self-forgiveness and love.</p> <p>But that’s not the half of it. The rental car agency, run by two uber-zany comedy characters played by Kevin Kline and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (the latter dropping F-bombs and doing a wacky German accent that she snaps out of while musing on how we all perform roles), has given David a special 90s vintage Saturn with its own mystical GPS which guides the couple to various magic doors in the landscape. They go through these to primal scenes of their past: to encounters with their respective parents, to a Canadian lighthouse where David once epiphanically realised he wasn’t having an epiphany, to a modern art gallery which Sarah’s late mother loved in her too-good-to-be-true way and which they now visit (for some reason) in the pitch darkness with a torch, to two separate hospitals which might somehow be the same hospital, and to David’s high school where he fell unrequitedly in love with his leading lady while performing in their Broadway-level production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, in the film’s best scene.</p> <p>Kogonada’s previous film After Yang had distinct touches of Charlie Kaufman in its futurist drama about a family who have an intense emotional connection with the secondhand AI humanoid robot they buy as a companion-sibling for their adopted daughter. And this film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well … or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge’s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no.</p> <p>When recognisably real things happen they stand out very sharply. Sarah, on a capricious whim at the wedding, asks David to marry her and, after a moment in which you think David is going to take her up on it, to indulge this fantasy, he appears to think better of it and instead says coldly: “You’ve destroyed some men, haven’t you …” And when Sarah and David arrive at David’s high school and Sarah realises everyone thinks David is the teenager he was then, she asks his drama teacher how old he thinks she is, and he replies “40” – an outrageously ungallant estimate which infuriates her. But there is also sweetness and charm, not disenchantment, in the breath-holding competition to which Sarah challenges David in the car – a game her mother liked.</p> <p>The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.</p> <p>• A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is out on 18 September in Australia, and on 19 September in the UK and US.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It doesn’t have to be miserable. We asked experts how best to start training your new (or old) best friend</p>",
    "content": "<p>My family has never been closer to the brink of collapse than when we got a puppy. We spent hours reading articles and watching videos about puppy training, and were constantly arguing about the right way to potty train him or get him to stop barking.</p> <p>Every new piece of information seemed to contradict what we’d already learned – never scold him! Scold him! – but one thing was certain: make one wrong move and you will ruin your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/dogs\">dog</a> and your life forever.</p> <p>We had fallen into a common trap.</p> <p>“The No 1 mistake people make [when training] is thinking, I have to make my dog be perfect and sit all the time, instead of remembering why we got a dog and that we’re meant to have fun together,” says Amanda Gagnon, a zoologist, behavior consultant and dog trainer in New York City.</p> <p>Training is how a dog and a human learn to communicate with each other and build a relationship, says Gagnon. This is essential to a dog’s safety and happiness, but it doesn’t need to be a joyless chore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/28/its-all-about-tone-of-voice-three-dog-trainers-on-how-to-beat-behavioural-problems\">‘It’s all about tone of voice’: three dog trainers on how to beat behavioural problems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We talked to experts about how to start training your dog – in a way that won’t make you lose your mind.</p> <h2>Manage expectations</h2> <p>Between social media, Lassie reruns and basic perfectionism, humans can sometimes have unrealistic standards for dogs.</p> <p>“A lot of people get stuck on the Instagram-perfect dog that is always happy and never has negative emotions,” says Alex Sessa, the owner and head trainer of Peach on a Leash in Atlanta.</p> <p>But dogs are individuals with different personalities and needs. Maybe you wanted a dog that accompanies you to the farmer’s market every Saturday, but crowds make your dog feel stressed.</p> <p>That’s not a problem, says Sessa – people just need to adjust their expectations accordingly. “That’s still a great dog. There’s nothing wrong with the dog that doesn’t want to go everywhere with us,” she says.</p> <p>And expecting your dog to always be perfectly calm can lead to greater behavioral trouble down the road, says Gagnon.</p> <p>“When we don’t give our dogs outlets to express themselves as dogs – meaning barking and running and being bananas in general – those needs get suppressed, and when that happens, it’s like a powder keg that’s going to explode at any moment,” she says.</p> <h2>Give them time to settle in</h2> <p>Whether you’re bringing home a puppy or an adult dog, experts agree it is important to give them plenty of time to acclimate.</p> <p>“Don’t jump into too much obedience right away,” Sessa says. “We don’t want the dog to immediately feel like we’re barking commands at them and asking them to do a million things.”</p> <p>Adult dogs in particular can take up to three months to settle into a new home and show their true behavior pattern, says Ciera Moberg, a certified dog behavior consultant and co-founder of Instinct Dog Behavior &amp; Training in Washington DC. The way your dog acts the first day you bring them home might be completely different than the way they act on day 30.</p> <p>Once your dog is comfortable and you have a better understanding of their personality – what they enjoy, what makes them nervous – it will be easier to figure out how you want to focus your training.</p> <h2>Figure out what commands your dog really needs</h2> <p>Most people don’t need to teach their dog as many commands – some trainers call them cues – as they might think.</p> <p>“You only absolutely need two cues,” says Gagnong. “You need ‘sit’, and you need ‘come’.”</p> <p><strong>Sit. </strong>When a dog is sitting, “there are very few behavioral problems they can exhibit,” says Gagnon. “This is about getting them into a calm position.”</p> <p>To teach a dog to sit, say the word and then use a treat to get them into a sitting position, Gagnon says. Usually this can be done by showing them a treat and then moving it over and slightly behind their head, so when they track it with their nose, their head moves up and back and their rear drops.</p> <p><strong>Come.</strong> A recall cue is essential for safety. “Teaching a dog to come when called is about preventing them from running off into the road or into a dog fight,” says Gagnon.</p> <p>To teach a dog to come, you start by standing close to them, saying the cue, and giving them the treat when they come to you. Then you take a step back, and do the same thing. Over time, you call the dog from a greater and greater distance.</p> <p>Moberg says she also likes to teach dogs “touch”, where their nose presses into the palm of your hand.</p> <p>“It allows you to move the dog without having to physically manipulate their body,” she says.</p> <p>To train this, say the cue, hold an open hand out at snout level, and when your dog touches it with their nose, give them a treat. Repeat.</p> <p>Besides basic safety commands, think about training functionally, Sessa says. What is important for you and your dog’s life together? Maybe your dog never needs to be able to lie down, but they need to be able to walk well on a leash. “So focus on that,” says Sessa. “There’s no one-size-fits-all training regimen.”</p> <p>There’s no need to spend hours on training. Sessa says she usually suggests her clients work with their dogs for no more than 10 to 15 minutes a day.</p> <h2>For puppies: socialize, socialize, socialize</h2> <p>A lot of people think socializing a puppy means introducing them to as many other dogs as possible, says Gagnon. It’s actually a much broader task. “It’s about introducing them to everything that’s going to be a part of their world in a positive way,” Gagnon says.</p> <p>If you live in a loud, busy city, for example, it is important to help your puppy get used to loud city sounds. But don’t overdo it.</p> <p>“It’s not good socialization to take a puppy and put it down right next to a jackhammer,” says Gagnon. If a puppy seems scared or like they’re trying to hide, it is important not to push them or make them uncomfortable.</p> <p><strong>More from How to start:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/02/how-to-start-meditating\">How to start meditating</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training\">How to start weightlifting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/16/the-dreaded-b-word-how-to-start-budgeting\">How to start budgeting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/20/how-to-start-sunning\">How to start running</a></p></li> </ul> <p>“You can put them two blocks away from the jackhammer and give them a treat while they’re hearing that sound, and that’s good socialization.”</p> <p>“Food is a great way to help your puppy feel better about things,” says Sessa. For example, if they’re meeting new people, have the strangers toss them a treat. “That helps them create a positive association,” she adds.</p> <p>Experts also suggest enrolling your dog in puppy classes or puppy social hours. However, poorly managed puppy groups can do more harm than good. A well-run class, Sessa says, will be small, have the dogs separated by size and collect the dogs’ vaccine records. It should also be moderated by a certified dog trainer.</p> <h2>Know when to call in a pro</h2> <p>At-home training can be beneficial, but in some situations, it is best to get help from a trainer.</p> <p>“If there’s anything dangerous, if there have been bites that have resulted in punctures, call a professional,” says Gagnon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/05/how-to-start-habit-activity-expert-tips\">How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something new</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s no need to wait until your dog is fully grown. In particular, if a puppy is having issues with biting, Gagnon suggests reaching out to a trainer, even just for a single session. Remote options are often available. “Half an hour online or with phone support can be relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of an aggression problem down the road,” she says.</p> <p>Professionals can also be helpful when dealing with anxious dogs, because anxiety “can be so case specific”, says Gagnon. For instance, you might think your dog is suffering separation anxiety, but your dog could be stressed about something else. A trainer can observe “and tell you what you’re dealing with”, Gagnon says.</p> <p>Finally, it’s important to pick a qualified behavior consultant or dog trainer. Sessa recommends looking for professionals who are credentialed with the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC).</p> <p>New dog owners can easily become overwhelmed by all the information and training options available, Sessa says. “Try not to get too caught up with what you’re seeing online. Those people haven’t interacted with your specific dog.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Manufacturers say new rules on passing on assets threaten investment and future survival of businesses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p> <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p> <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p> <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p> <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p> <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p> <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p> <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p> <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p> <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>. </p> <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p> <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p> <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p> <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>    <p>A study by CBI Economics found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p> <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p> <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p> <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p> <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p> <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p> <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p> <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p> <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p> <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p> <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Jaguar Land Rover says cyber-attack has affected ‘some data’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p> <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p> <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p> <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p> <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p> <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p> <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p> <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>",

He told journalists: “Israel categorically rejects the libellous rant published today by this commission of inquiry.”</p> <p>Israel has rejected the charge of genocide, citing its right to self-defence after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, andtook 251 hostages. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 64,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.</p> <h2>What the report says</h2> <p>To count as genocide under the 1948 UN genocide convention, adopted after the murder of 6 million Jewish people in the Holocaust, at least one of five acts must have occurred. The UN commission accuses Israel of committing four. It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses and doctors, verified open-source documents, reporting by media and NGOs, and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began.</p> <p>In the <strong>first category</strong><strong> of killing</strong>, the commission quotes UN reporting that as of 15 July 2025, at least 46% of Palestinians killed in Gaza were women and children. The commission also cited reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">the Guardian</a> based on Israeli intelligence that 83% of those killed in Gaza were civilians.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Israel has used heavy unguided munitions with a wide margin of error in densely populated residential areas … The number of bombs used by Israel since 7 October 2023 is extraordinary even in comparison to other world conflicts.</p> <p>Palestinians in Gaza were attacked in their homes, at hospitals, in shelters (including schools and religious sites), during the evacuations and in designated safe zones. At times, civilians, journalists, healthcare professionals, humanitarian workers and other protected persons were directly targeted and killed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission highlighted the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/im-so-scared-please-come-hind-rajab-six-found-dead-in-gaza-12-days-after-cry-for-help\">five children</a> when their family car was targeted near a petrol station in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City on 29 January 2024, noting that Israeli security forces fired on an ambulance, “preventing access to the victims”.</p> <p>It also pointed to casualties that resulted from tight restrictions on humanitarian aid – especially medicine and medical equipment – from entering Gaza, quoting an obstetrician who spoke about deaths of pregnant women he had treated, whom he referred to as “indirect victims of war”.</p> <p>The commission describes at length the killing of 15 paramedics by Israeli forces in southern Gaza in March and “notes the consistent pattern of conduct demonstrated by the Israeli security forces in the aftermath of attacks, in that they have often denied and shifted responsibilities until evidence that contradicts their narrative surfaced”, also pointing to an acute lack of accountability.</p> <p>The report said Israeli authorities knew of the high numbers of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023 but “did not intervene to change the means and methods of warfare employed [but] persisted over time and caused even more Palestinian deaths”.</p> <p>“The Commission therefore finds that the Israeli authorities intended to kill as many Palestinians as possible through its military operations in Gaza since 7 October 2023 and knew that the means and methods of warfare employed would cause mass deaths of Palestinians, including children,” it says.</p>    <p>Turning to the <strong>second category</strong> <strong>of acts that qualify as genocidal, causing serious bodily or mental harm</strong>, the commission highlighted the mistreatment of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqldpyn5ng6o\">Palestinian detainees</a> by Israeli security forces and mass displacement which, it said, “has caused serious and irreparable physical and mental harm to Palestinians in Gaza who have lost their homes and have been forced to live in inhumane conditions”.</p> <p>In the <strong>third category</strong><strong> of deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</strong>, the report noted that much of Gaza had been rendered virtually uninhabitable, that huge numbers of bakeries, schools, cultural sites and religious landmarks had been completely destroyed, and that attacks on hospitals had led to a collapse of the healthcare system. It also highlighted the recent declaration by respected UN-backed monitors of famine in parts of Gaza.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Considering the evidence in totality, the Commission has found that Israeli authorities were aware of the high probability that their military operations, the imposition of a total siege … and the destruction of housing and of health systems and facilities would lead to the physical destruction of Palestinians, in whole or in part, in Gaza … The Commission therefore finds that Israeli authorities knowingly and deliberately inflicted such conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.</p> </blockquote> <p>The section on the <strong>fourth category</strong><strong> of imposing measures intended to prevent births</strong> is more concise, and focuses largely on the high proportion of casualties who were children, and the attack in December 2023 against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15npnzpd08o\">al-Basma IVF clinic</a>, Gaza’s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed about 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.</p> <p>“It is reasonable to conclude that the Israeli security forces knew of the function of the clinic and intended to target it and destroy the reproductive material within,” the report concludes, adding that “the widespread and systematic targeting of children is part of a strategy to destroy the biological continuity and future existence of the Palestinian group in Gaza”.</p>    <h2>Intent</h2> <p>International law experts say that it is often difficult to support genocide charges because of the requirement to prove intent, or even in some circumstances, sole intent.</p> <p>The commission concluded that statements by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other officials were “direct evidence of genocidal intent”.</p> <p>The report cited his letter to Israeli soldiers in November 2023 comparing the Gaza operation to what the commission describes as a “holy war of total annihilation” in the Hebrew Bible.</p> <p>The report also named the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant.</p> <p>Navi Pillay, the South African former judge who is the most senior of the report’s three authors, headed a UN tribunal for Rwanda where more than 1 million people were killed in 1994.</p> <p>“The commission concludes that statements made by Israeli authorities are direct evidence of genocidal intent [and] also concludes that the pattern of conduct is circumstantial evidence for genocidal intent and that genocidal intent was the only reasonably inference that can be drawn from the totality of the evidence,” she told reporters on Tuesday.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Creative director Stuart Vevers appeals to gen z audience with ‘down-to-earth pieces’ for New York fashion week</p>",
    "content": "<p>New York fashion week is proving a particularly perplexing time for brands as they continue to grapple with <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/luxury-market-faces-first-slowdown-study-estimates-decrease-1237927288/\">a global slowdown</a>, leading many to question what luxury even means today.</p> <p>For some consumers, it is always going to be about a gleaming five-figure handbag. For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.</p> <p>However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.</p> <p>Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.</p>    <p>Welcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.</p> <p>On the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/the-lyst-index/the-lyst-index-q2-25/\">Lyst Index</a>, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/tapestrys-sales-rise-on-popularity-of-coach-brand-5744f87f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjWn5B7_FiKqywF7GVXo6XIdrBjmyxniTJN94yYGfC6xLGwm1_yWqoKvkoWKgc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c8d290&amp;gaa_sig=NOFi37IP8xHfJGqWZcxkkw24UUiGqcLcT7Mc_xbeA4g9afi9RLQkiMEU9b6RIaeN915EO4WcjFcD29omMaMy4g%3D%3D\">$1.43bn since January</a>. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.</p> <p>While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”</p> <p>Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”</p> <p>Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.</p> <p>Coach is also leaning into its 84-year history. Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.</p> <p>Lopez has used previous catwalks to highlight issues including immigration and homophobia. This time around, he said he wanted to “pay tribute to the syncretic spirit of the Dominican Republic”. Lopez, who is a third-generation Dominican, played with texture using feathers and beading to add depth to bodysuits and tailoring. He described the collection as a confrontation of “the brutal legacy of slavery – how it fractured bodies, families and futures – yet simultaneously birthed radical forms of creativity, expression and resistance”.</p>",

    "title": "Sir David Davies obituary",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/sir-david-davies-obituary",
    "description": "<p>Engineer whose recommendations after the Ladbroke Grove train crash led to improved safety on the railways</p>",
    "content": "<p>When David Davies, who has died aged 89, was asked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/21/lord-prescott-john-prescott-obituary\">John Prescott</a>, the then deputy prime minister and transport secretary, to undertake an inquiry into the safety system on Britain’s railways after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/05/the-ladbroke-grove-rail-disaster-lessons-to-be-learned-20-years-on\">Ladbroke Grove train crash of 1999</a>, the BBC could not conceal its excitement. The report said: “Sir David Davies may not be a household name, but he is among the few people that the term genius can be applied to without overstatement.”</p> <p>Davies – known universally as Den, taken from his initials – probably enjoyed this description. Aged 12, while at Llandaff Catholic school in Cardiff, he knocked on the headmaster’s door to complain he was not being intellectually challenged and asked, successfully, to be moved up to the next class. He went on to a glittering career in industry and academia.</p> <p>Consequently, described by his colleagues as utterly unflappable and always calm, he did not hesitate to take on the task offered by Prescott, which came at a crucial time in the midst of something of a national panic about the state of the railways. The Ladbroke Grove disaster, in which 31 people died, was the worst accident on the railways since 1988 and the second major crash caused by a train going past a red signal, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/21/keithharper\">Southall two years previously</a>. There was widespread concern among the public that the railways were not safe and that not enough was being done to improve the situation.</p> <p>Fortunately, Prescott avoided a kneejerk response to public outrage, and instead put his trust in Davies, who had the relevant experience for the job. He was not only at the time the president of the <a href=\"https://www.raeng.org.uk/\">Royal Academy of Engineering</a>, a fairly new national academy whose creation had been at the behest of Prince Philip, but he had also worked in British Rail’s research department in the late 1960s and was familiar with the workings of the railway. His approach was meticulous and at the time controversial.</p> <p>His report, published in early 2000, was a thorough assessment of the two main technologies that were capable of reducing the risk of drivers failing to stop at a red signal. At the time, the newly privatised railways were introducing a fairly simple Train Protection &amp; Warning System, which was very effective but did not prevent certain types of overrun, notably if trains were going particularly fast. However, because the alternative system, Automatic Train Protection, was several times more expensive and would take far longer to install across the network, Davies strongly recommended the former, arguing that it would ultimately save more lives because of its rapid implementation.</p>    <p>The intervening quarter of a century has proved that he was right. The number of signals passed at danger on the railways has been reduced dramatically and, while there has been the occasional near miss, there has been no major accident involving signalling on the railways since then. His approach, of getting a good system implemented quickly rather than a perfect one brought in more slowly, was proved to be a brilliant judgment.</p> <p>Davies later briefly chaired an organisation called Railway Safety, which was set up to promote safety issues, and he focused on the poor state of much of the fencing protecting the tracks. This came to the fore after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/28/selby-rail-crash-driver-fate\">the 2001 Selby train crash</a>, when a Land Rover tumbled down an embankment and caused two trains to collide, killing 10 people.</p> <p>Born in Cardiff, to Sarah (nee Samuel) and David Davies, an estate agent, David Jr studied electrical engineering at the University of Birmingham, and was awarded his PhD in 1960; he later joined the staff. He met his future wife, Enid Patilla, there, but waited seven years before proposing to her as, he revealed later, he wanted to make sure he could provide for his future family. After several academic posts, notably at University College London and Loughborough University, where he was vice-chancellor, he became chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence in 1993, and the following year was knighted.</p> <p>While his Ladbroke Grove report was his most publicised work, it should not overshadow Davies’s remarkable achievements in scientific research, which was the source of the BBC’s approbation. His research work was varied, covering work in antenna arrays, radar, signal processing and optical fibres.</p> <p>It was the developments in the last of these that were particularly groundbreaking, as he invented fibreoptic sensors, which could provide sensitive measurement of quantities such as strain or temperature, and could even be the basis of a kilometre-long microphone with high dynamic range. All this was despite the fact that fibreoptic cables were at the time being championed in telecommunications for their insensitivity to disturbances and therefore unable to be used in this way. His research opened up a huge potential market for the wide use of fibreoptics.</p> <p>Consequently, for this work he won the Rank prize for optoelectronics in 1984. He later also won the Institution of Electrical Engineers’ Faraday medal in 1987. He served on the committees of many national bodies, including the BBC engineering advisory committee and the Royal Society’s science inquirycommittee.</p> <p>Enid died in 1990. In 1992 he married Jennifer Rayner, a chartered surveyor. She survives him, as do his two sons, Michael and Christopher, from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter, Ruth.</p> <p>• David Evan Naunton Davies, engineer and government adviser, born 28 October 1935; died 19 August 2025</p>",

    "content": "<p>The owner of the ceramics business Wedgwood has said it will freeze production at its factory in Staffordshire for 90 days in a move that will place 70 workers on temporary leave.</p> <p>The shutdown, which the firm’s owner, Fiskars Group, described as a short-term measure, will start on 29 September in response to weaker demand in some of its most important markets.</p> <p>It will also pause factory tours at its World of Wedgwood tourist attraction, with plans to restart them early next year.</p> <p>Wedgwood, which can trace its heritage to the 18th century, makes porcelain and luxury home accessories.</p> <p>It is headquartered in Barlaston near Stoke-on-Trent, where it employs 274 people. The company said it had many more people working globally for the business in markets such as China and Japan, where it has the majority of its stores.</p> <p>The pottery and ceramics sector has struggled in recent years under the pressure of rising costs and energy bills. A number of potteries have collapsed in Staffordshire, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/18/staffordshire-potteries-ceramics-companies-closures-royal-stafford\">the nearly 200-year-old Royal Stafford in February.</a></p> <p>A Wedgwood spokesperson said: “This short-term measure is being taken to address elevated inventory levels caused by lower consumer demand in some of our key markets.</p> <p>“Barlaston and its community are of key importance to Fiskars Group and Wedgwood.”</p> <p>The company said its artisans still used techniques pioneered by founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/01/wedgwood-collection-v-and-a-treasures\">Josiah Wedgwood, who was born in Staffordshire in 1730.</a></p> <p>“This living tradition reflects our commitment to craftsmanship, the value of Made in England and Barlaston’s enduring role in our heritage and operations,” a Fiskars spokesperson said.</p> <p>Fiskars, which employs 6,850 people across its group, also owns Royal Doulton and the Danish porcelain brand Royal Copenhagen, among others.</p> <p>The business, which is listed in Finland, reported net sales of €1.2bn (£1bn) in its 2024 financial year, up slightly from €1.1bn in the previous year. Its pre-tax profit, however, fell by 77% from €79.7m to €18.5m.</p> <p>The group lowered its profit guidance for the year in June, blaming the impact of US tariffs on retailer demand. The US accounts for about 30% of its overall sales.</p> <p>Wedgwood dates back to 1759, when Josiah Wedgwood started as an independent potter in Staffordshire. He invented new ceramic materials such as jasperware and black basalt, and was among the first makers to stamp his name on his product. He was the grandfather of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/16/great-dynasities-the-darwins\">Charles Darwin.</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Data public health experts say is worrisome will reportedly be presented to ACIP later this week before vote on shots</p>",
    "content": "<p>US health officials are reportedly planning to release data on child deaths and serious side effects they would attribute to Covid-19 vaccines, raising alarm among public health experts who say the publicly available data does not support these claims and the report may lead to increased anti-vaccine sentiment.</p> <p>Independent advisers for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) later this week plan to revisit recommendations for Covid shots as well as vaccines for measles and hepatitis B.</p> <p>The move is part of a larger effort to cast doubt on vaccines and reduce access to them, said David Gorski, a professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University who has <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/david-gorski/\">tracked</a> anti-vaccine activism for decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/cdc-leadership-loss-experts-alarmed\">‘Americans should be alarmed’: Experts say loss of expertise at CDC will harm US health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is a longtime anti-vaxxer who continues to make sweeping, controversial changes to the US vaccine program, Gorski said.</p> <p>“RFK Jr wants to take away your vaccines,” he said.</p> <p>Officials are looking at 25 reports of pediatric deaths following Covid vaccination, apparently stemming from the crowdsourced database known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/\">reporting</a> by the Washington Post.</p> <p>Yet years of data and research show that Covid vaccinations are safe and effective.</p> <p>“Covid vaccination involved much larger numbers of people receiving vaccines than we’ve had for anything in history,” said Anne Schuchat, a former principal deputy director of the CDC.</p> <p>Using VAERS to cast doubt on the safety of vaccines is a decades-long anti-vax tactic, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16452357/\">research</a> has shown a spike in reports related to litigation, Gorski said.</p> <p>While the system can help discover red flags, Schuchat noted it can’t be used to demonstrate causality.</p> <p>“Anybody can report into it,” she said – including patients, family members, lawyers, friends and people on social media. One doctor successfully submitted a report on his transformation into the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060427200248/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism\">Incredible Hulk</a>.</p> <p>The child deaths report is expected to be presented at the meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) later this week.</p> <p>Staff at the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process”, said Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson, in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>“Until that is shared publicly, any of this should be considered pure speculation.”</p> <p>ACIP will vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth, and Covid vaccines – and it will also hold votes for the Vaccines for Children program, which provides shots to nearly half of children in the US.</p> <p>It’s not clear what the ACIP votes will entail, but experts believe some of the shots may be restricted and others may lose their recommendation, which would affect insurance coverage – especially from Medicaid and Medicare.</p> <p>“If it’s not on the CDC recommended schedule, then insurance companies don’t have to pay for it,” Gorski said. “Federal government programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not pay for it, the Vaccines for Children program will not pay for it. Now, insurance companies might decide to pay for it anyway, at least within the FDA guidelines, but there’s no guarantee that they all will.”</p> <p>On Monday, days before the ACIP meeting is set to begin, HHS announced five more advisers, some of whom have a history of troubling statements on vaccines and infectious disease.</p> <p>There are other safety systems to flag side effects, like the Vaccine Safety Datalink, that are confirmed by medical records and also provide comparisons to understand if an unanticipated adverse event is linked to vaccines, Schuchat said. It’s not clear if the report will pull from these sources.</p> <p>“We are getting the data that was never made available before, including adverse event data,” Marty Makary, head of the FDA , told CNN earlier this month.</p> <p>Those possible adverse events include “young people who have died from the Covid vaccine”, he added. “And we’re going to make that available to the medical community in full transparency, because this is the question that Americans are asking.”</p> <p>Kennedy’s team at HHS reportedly requested full access to VAERS, including the ability to modify the database.</p> <p>“We allowed them to have read access but would not give them write access,” said Peter Marks, the former vaccines chief at FDA.</p> <p>Reports of death, especially among children, would be “the top priority” for health officials, said Gorski.</p> <p>Any reports of serious side effects are investigated by officials at the CDC and FDA, said Schuchat.</p> <p>“There is a deep look into the death of a child or particularly worrisome reports,” she said.</p> <p>Now, the FDA seems to be reopening these reports. It’s not clear whether the FDA is doing anything differently with these investigations now, or how they would reclassify deaths as vaccine-related.</p> <p>“Anything’s possible,” Schuchat said. “We’re in new territory right now.”</p> <p>FDA could also temporarily pull the licenses of Covid vaccines while it investigates potential events, or it could add a black-box warning about the purported risks of the vaccine.</p> <p>Yet the FDA recently granted full licensure to Covid vaccines <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/drdemetre.bsky.social/post/3lynsfagw4s24\">without raising concerns</a> about credible safety issues.</p> <p>Changes to the CDC’s recommendations could instead limit the vaccines until most people can’t access them, Gorski said. “My fear is that within a year, the Covid vaccines will be gone, for all intents and purposes.”</p> <p>Anti-vax officials seem to view the Covid shots as a “test case” or a template for restricting access to other vaccines, Gorski said, before adding that the hepatitis B vaccine currently given at birth may lose its recommendation as soon as this week.</p> <p>More than 1,000 current and former HHS employees have called for Kennedy’s resignation because of moves like this – including Schuchat.</p> <p>“It’s really scary, the actions he’s taking and the people he seems to be trusting,” she said of Kennedy. “This person has so much authority right now.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a British national on suspicion of the murder of the Kenyan woman Agnes Wanjiru, who was found dead in the grounds of a hotel near an army base in 2012.</p> <p>The high court judge Alexander Muteti issued the arrest warrant earlier on Tuesday in Kenya, with the prosecution telling the court a suspect had been charged with murder, and his extradition to Kenya was being sought.</p> <p>UK-based witnesses will be called on to testify in a future trial, the prosecution said. “The witnesses are in United Kingdom but we will avail them,” the court heard.</p> <p>The office of the director of public prosecutions informed the court that the accused had been charged with the offence of murder.</p> <p>Wanjiru, 21, was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out in the Lion’s Court hotel in her home town of Nanyuki on 31 March 2012.</p> <p>She disappeared that night, with friends and family searching for her, until her body was found months later stuffed inside a septic tank at the hotel.</p> <p>Wanjiru, who worked as a hairdresser, and sometimes sold sex for extra money, had a daughter, Stacey, who was just five months old at the time that she disappeared.</p> <p>It is understood that Kenyan authorities will begin extradition proceedings, with the intention that the soldier will face charges in Kenya.</p> <p>“We have lived with the pain of Agnes’s death for over a decade,” her family said in a statement. “The reports that an arrest warrant has been issued against a UK citizen is a significant moment for us and is incredibly welcome.”</p> <p>Tessa Gregory, the family’s lawyer and a partner at Leigh Day, added: “The family now calls upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible.”</p> <p>If he is extradited, it is believed it will be the first time a current or former British soldier has ever been extradited to another country to face trial for the murder of a civilian.</p> <p>Wanjiru’s death has already been the focus of two inquests and several criminal inquiries.</p> <p>The bar of the Lion’s Court hotel was a popular destination for British soldiers, who were based at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) in Nanyuki, which is about 125 miles north of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>The inquest heard that Wanjiru had last been seen leaving the bar with one or more British soldiers.</p> <p>A suspect was named by several soldiers who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, after an investigation into the murder by the Sunday Times in 2021.</p> <p>Since the newspaper identified a suspected killer, it is understood that Kenyan detectives have flown to the UK several times to question soldiers and ex-soldiers who were in Nanyuki at the time of the murder.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the defence secretary, John Healey, met Wanjiru’s family in Kenya and promised the UK’s “full support” for the investigation.</p> <p>“It was deeply humbling to meet the family of Agnes Wanjiru today,” Healey said in April. “In the 13 years since her death, they have shown such strength in their long fight for justice. I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.”</p> <p>Previously, as shadow defence secretary, Healey had called on the then Conservative government to do more to resolve the case.</p> <p>“Agnes’s death has had a profound and devastating impact on our family,” her relatives previously said in a statement.</p> <p>“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death.”<br><br>“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a spokesperson for the UK government said.</p> <p>“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.</p> <p>“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”</p> <p>No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.<strong> </strong>The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a tough week for Labour, Donald Trump is touching down for a state visit. Let’s hope the PM can stomach it</p>",
    "content": "<p>Quick update on Keir Starmer’s government of “national renewal”: having just lost his deputy and housing secretary over her failure to pay the required stamp duty, the prime minister has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">lost his US ambassador</a> over his known close association with a known paedophile sex trafficker. Hang on – he’s now also lost his director of political strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/senior-starmer-adviser-paul-ovenden-quits-over-offensive-diane-abbott-messages\">relating some dirty jokes</a> about Diane Abbott.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an increasing number of people think the solution to all this is Andy Burnham taking over, suggesting the current Greater Manchester mayor could run in a parliamentary seat that has only notionally become free because the previous Labour MP was suspended from the party after being found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/10/labour-was-told-about-vile-whatsapp-group-more-than-a-year-ago-says-ex-councillor\">sent messages</a> hoping a couple of constituents would soon be dead/“mown down”, and is now apparently “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLVgxUGIodU/\">off sick</a>”. On top of which, we’re having the Americans round. US president Donald Trump touches down in the UK tonight on the eve of the most hideously ill-starred dinner party since the vomiting scene in Triangle of Sadness. I don’t think the nation could possibly feel any more renewed.</p> <p>It’s been a few days since Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein were held up in front of the public using the hazmat tongs, and the more I’ve thought about them, the more I come back to one of the more obscure lines. Writing in apparent anguish on the eve of Epstein’s incarceration in 2008, Mandelson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/peter-mandelson-messages-jeffrey-epstein-disturbing-and-sickening-says-minister\">opines to him</a>: “It just could not happen in Britain.” Maybe he was right, unwittingly or otherwise. Britain is very, very good at a sort of institutionalised looking away. Maybe Mandelson was – unwittingly or otherwise – characterising something grim about this country that pious old Keir Starmer would no doubt be hugely affronted to be caught up in. Except, the prime minister <em>is</em> caught up in it – in fact, he’s at the very centre of it. He is the one who looked away.</p> <p>It’s hard not to feel there is something necrotic and beaten about a government whose leader would appoint someone he knew had been very close to Epstein, who the entire world by that point knew was – and forgive me for repeating the words – a paedophile sex trafficker. Association with him was already known to be such a horror show that the late Queen Elizabeth II had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/chucked-under-royal-bus-prince-andrews-demotion-shows-institutions-ruthlessness\">sack her own son</a> for it. And there is something worse about Starmer’s horrifying lack of curiosity even as the facts closed in, right till the bitter end, with No 10 dithering for staggeringly long last week over a set of quite the most disqualifying emails, while Starmer fannied about defending Mandelson at the dispatch box.</p> <p>This was, of course, the other dispatch box to the one at which Sir Keir plied his holier-than-thou trade in opposition. There’s an old online rule that declares that if you tell someone off for their spelling or grammar, you will always end up making your own howler while you’re doing it. Starmer spent his years in opposition telling off the Tories at every turn, instead of – for instance – coming up with a creative and coherent plan for growth. Inevitably, we now seem to be strapped in to watching him and his administration warrant a daily telling-off, as offences and immoralities mount up. Why does this keep happening to him, etc?</p> <p>As for Epstein, we know that at the time Mandelson was writing to him telling him to fight for early release, police in Palm Beach, Florida had identified 36 girls<strong> </strong>who the “financier” had sexually abused. Yet for all the many years of grim and grotesque revelations, it still feels as though we know remarkably little about him. Who was he, this mysterious paedo Gatsby, and where did all his money come from?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/peter-mandelson-keir-starmer-labour\">It’s over and out (again) for Mandelson, but how many political lives does Starmer have left? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly after his death, New York magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/hedge-funders-have-some-thoughts-on-what-epstein-was-doing.html\">ran a fascinating story</a> in which real hedge-funders expressed pointed bemusement over how Epstein made his money, since none of them had really had any dealings with him. As one big hedge-fund president, Doug Kass, put it: “I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested. Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.” As Kass had said to a journalist: “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” Or as another hedgie remarked: “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” And yet Epstein had made no noise at all in the financial world. They could barely find one investor. Their general theory was that the “hedge fund” was simply a cover for a blackmail scheme.</p> <p>Perhaps most amazing, really, is the fact that Epstein will be a ghost at the feast tomorrow night for more than one attender, as Trump continues to butch out his long and close association with precisely the type of evildoer his Maga followers are convinced runs the world. Epstein is a guy who really does fit the very template of their darkest conspiracy theories – rich and powerful, involved in the trafficking of minors, connected in a network of some of the most powerful people in the world. This is all the sort of stuff they’ve been going on about for years – yet who should keep rearing his head in the story, but their own beloved president.</p> <p>Isn’t it intriguing how many of them (currently) just can’t bring themselves to believe it? Something to discuss over the starter tomorrow night at Windsor Castle, perhaps, as long as everyone can keep their food down.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "<p>A play by the Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/29/black-panther-actor-chadwick-boseman-dies-of-cancer\">died of cancer aged 43</a> in 2020, is to receive its UK premiere next year.</p> <p>Deep Azure was written by Boseman in response to the death of Prince Jones, his fellow college student at Washington DC’s Howard University, who was killed in 2000 by a police officer. The play was first performed in 2005 in the US and will be staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in February, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/02/chadwick-boseman-theatre-black-panther\">‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick Boseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fynn-Aiduenu described the play as “incredibly poignant in speaking about the injustices of police brutality and the unwinding nature of grief, but also the gorgeous brilliance of our Black Souls and exploring every hue they can express on a stage”. He said that Boseman’s love of Shakespeare and hip-hop combined in a “layered, ghostly epic that I have been given the privilege and duty to fully realise”.</p> <p>Boseman was best known for his performance in the title role of Marvel’s Black Panther, and was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10514222/?ref_=nmawd_awd_1\">Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</a>, based on August Wilson’s play. But before he rose to fame as an actor, he had shown himself to be a promising playwright.</p> <p>The director Derrick Sanders, another Howard University alumnus who commissioned Deep Azure, told the Guardian in 2020 that Boseman took the elements of hip-hop culture – graffiti, DJing, rapping, breakdancing – “and combined them into a narrative form. The storytelling would move it in and out of hip-hop, almost as a precursor to Hamilton.”</p> <p>Boseman studied Shakespeare at Oxford University with the British American Drama Academy in 1998. He had wanted to make a film of Deep Azure before his Hollywood career exploded. Daniel Banks, who directed the play at the <a href=\"https://www.folger.edu/folger-theatre\">Folger theatre in Washington DC</a>, said that it was “written as a ritual of community healing”. The killing of Jones by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000 was also covered by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates in the 2015 book Between the World and Me. In 2006, after a civil trial, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/25/AR2006092501456.html\">damages were awarded</a> to Jones’s young daughter for his wrongful death.</p> <p>Deep Azure will run from 7 February to 11 April in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the indoor candlelit venue run by Shakespeare’s Globe. It will be performed alongside a new production of The Tempest (17 January to 12 April) directed by Tim Crouch, who will play Prospero alongside Naomi Wirthner (How to Train Your Dragon)<em><strong> </strong></em>as Ariel.</p> <p>Crouch is the creator of a series of acclaimed Shakespearean dramas presented from the perspective of the plays’ minor characters, including I, Caliban and I, Banquo. He said he had “been given the keys to the most interesting theatre in London. The spaces at the Globe are not anonymous black boxes that try to disappear as soon as the play begins. They are companions to any work that happens in them; good companions which support and contribute to the stories that they house.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/british-democracy-under-threat-elon-musk",
    "description": "<p>Tesla’s boss has already done his best to destabilise the US, Canada and Germany. Keir Starmer needs to push back</p>",
    "content": "<p>The year is 2125 and an AI-powered hologram of Elon Musk is CEO of The World, Inc. Nation states are defunct and “citizens” an outdated concept. Now people function more like non-voting shareholders of heavily armed corporations. Anyone who dares to criticise Lord Musk is sentenced to death in a burning Tesla.</p> <p>This isn’t my poor attempt at science fiction (apart from some creative licence around the AI Musk and Tesla executions). Rather, it’s a simplified approximation of the world Curtis Yarvin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html\">Silicon Valley’s favourite thinker</a>, wants to usher in. Yarvin, whose “dark enlightenment” ideas have influenced the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552\">Trump administration</a> and political kingmakers <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2022/05/the-strange-and-terrifying-ideas-of-neoreactionaries\">such as Peter Thiel</a>, believes super-rich elites should have dictatorial powers; universities and the press shouldn’t hold any sway; and the hoi polloi should suck it all up.</p> <p>Musk is not a straightforward disciple of Yarvin, but both believe governments should be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-trumps-reign-fits-curtis-yarvins-blueprint-of-a-ceo-led-american-monarchy-what-is-technological-fascism-256202\">treated as corporations</a> and share disdain for liberal democracy and “woke” institutions. Both also have a raze-and-rebuild approach to the world. Indeed, long before Musk launched his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Yarvin devised <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/08/curtis-yarvin-doge-musk-thiel/\">Rage</a>, a plan to “retire all government employees”. Yarvin, by the way, wasn’t impressed with Doge (he compared it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner) because it didn’t grab enough power.</p> <p>I bring all this up because, as Musk vies for a larger role on the world stage, it’s imperative we’re clear about what he’s trying to achieve. The billionaire, who spent <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">more than $290m</a> (£210m) influencing the US election, is increasingly taking his political meddling worldwide: he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/canada-election-elon-musk-justin-trudeau\">inserted himself into Canadian politics</a> earlier this year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/elon-musk-afd-germany-mainstream-far-right\">helped boost</a> Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk spent January posting about grooming gangs in the UK and turned his attention back to the country over the weekend, appearing via video at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">far-right rally</a> in London. Musk called for a “change of government” and said: “Violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” A man who was born in South Africa but emigrated to the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/canada-musk-petition-revoke-citizenship-00205964\">by way of Canada</a> wants Britons to be terrified of foreigners.</p> <p>So what’s the end goal here? Is Musk being guided by a Yarvinesque ideology or is this just what happens when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/elon-musk-trump-drug-use\">industrial amounts of ketamine</a> the billionaire is reported to have consumed interact with the world’s largest ego?</p> <p>While a God complex may be at play, a politics of chaos appears to be Musk’s short-term goal. It feels increasingly as if the tech mogul is trying to stoke civil unrest and destabilise democracies worldwide so he can accumulate more power. In his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">new year address</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">Robert Habeck</a>, Germany’s vice-chancellor at the time, came to a similar conclusion, calling Musk’s support for the AfD a “logical and systematic” play to weaken Europe. “A weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power,” Habeck said.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s weaknesses – his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">approval rating</a> is dismal – certainly seem to have captured Musk’s interest. Musk may not have an ideology as developed as Yarvin’s, but it does feel as if he’s attempting to become de facto CEO of the world, with deputies around the globe. It’s not inconceivable that Musk could effect regime change in Britain. And I’m not sure the government is taking this threat seriously enough. At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-palestine-action-the-ban-on-gaza-activists-must-be-overturned\">pensioners are being arrested</a> for waving “Palestine Action” placards, the response to Musk’s calls for people to “fight back or … die” at a protest where 26 police officers were injured could have been somewhat more forceful. Starmer should impose sanctions on Musk, not just wag his finger at him.</p> <p>What’s really at issue here, however, is the system that produced Musk and enabled his meddling. A healthy democracy should have safeguards in place that ensure a handful of super-rich individuals can’t usurp the political process. Those safeguards were removed from the US in 2010 with the supreme court’s <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\">Citizens United ruling</a>, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and in effect allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Britain has nowhere near the amount of money sloshing through its politics as the US does, but an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/30/uk-political-donations-dark-money\">analysis last</a> year found dark money is rife: almost £1 in every £10 donated to British parties and politicians came from unknown or dubious sources.</p> <p>Musk is odious, but he is right that Britain is under threat: if we don’t fight to conserve democracy, it will die. However, the foreigners we should worry about are not desperate people on small boats, they’re billionaires with rocket ships.</p> <p><em>• </em>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

It’s a disaster’: the small boat detainees waiting to be sent back to France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian is aware of one case in which a legal challenge lodged by an individual asylum seeker who was due to fly on Monday was unsuccessful. He was placed in a segregated area of the detention centre but was released back to his cell in the early hours of Monday and told he would not be flying after all.</p> <p>Detention NGOs have reported several people who had received removal directions for Monday, at least one person with removal directions for Tuesday and at least two people with removal directions for Wednesday. NGO sources say it is unclear why the person with removal directions for Tuesday had their ticket cancelled.</p> <p>France has reportedly said it will accept only a small initial contingent of deportations of around 50 people, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme in an effort to stop small boat crossings in the Channel.</p> <p>Lochlinn Parker, the acting director of Detention Action, said: “The government’s deal with France is failing people seeking asylum at every step. Adults and children are arriving from Afghanistan, Palestine, Syria and elsewhere, seeking our protection, only to be locked in small cells and denied the support they urgently need. The new home secretary must change course.”</p> <p>An estimated 31,026 people have made the journey so far this year, putting 2025 on course to be a record year for crossings.</p>",

Kipyegon delivered a gun-to-tape run that destroyed the field as she came home clear in 3 minutes 52.15 seconds. The world record holder matches Hicham El Guerrouj (1997-2003) by claiming four world 1,500m golds and she will also go for a second world 5,000m title later this week.

Orlando Bennett ran a personal best 13.08 to win silver, while his fellow Jamaican Tyler Mason took the bronze in 13.12, which matched his previous best time.

Should she win, the three-time Olympic and three-time world champion will draw level with Hicham El Guerrouj, who won this race at this meet on four occasions, and at 31, it’s incumbent upon us to savour her while we still can.</p> \n  <p>Or, in other words, Mondo needs to budge up, because there are others planning to take out a des res inside our heads.</p> \n  <p><strong>Action starts: 7.35pm local, 11.35am BST</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div>",

Deals involving Nvidia, the world’s largest AI chip maker, and OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI assistant, are anticipated.</p> <p>But campaigners have said a wave of massive new computer warehouses will crank up Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on finite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/22/ai-data-centre-power-consumption\">power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/17/ai-boom-environment-agency-cannot-predict-future-water-shortages-england-data-centres\">water resources</a>.</p> <p>If allowed, the Thurrock complex will include up to four datacentres on “grey belt” land part-occupied by a former speedway and stock car track.

Google’s planning application stresses this remains a “minor adverse and not significant impact when compared to the UK carbon budgets”, but campaigners disagree.</p> <p>“Google’s planned facility in Essex will produce carbon emissions several times higher than those of an international airport,” said a spokesperson for Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology. “But this is just one of many ‘hyperscale’ datacentres that US big tech wants to impose on the UK – in pursuit of their own profits and regardless of the cost to our environment.</p> <p>“Starmer’s government needs to stop bowing to the Trump-big tech agenda and start standing up for the interests of the UK public – otherwise we will all be paying for the tech giants’ datacentres, whether in terms of soaring energy bills, dwindling water supplies or a heating planet.”</p> <p>Datacentres now <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-01-27/debates/7D94F44D-EA1F-4D0F-87A8-2B5BCFD00DEF/InternetActivityEnergyUse\">consume about 2.5% of the UK’s electricity</a>, and demand on the grid is expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report\">to increase fourfold by 2030</a>, according to the House of Commons library.</p> <p>The British government does not believe datacentres will have a significant impact on the UK’s carbon budget because of its ambitious targets for electricity grid decarbonisation. Rather it is worried that without massive investment in new datacentres, the UK will fall behind international rivals, including France, resulting in a “compute gap” that “risks undermining national security, economic growth, and the UK’s ambition to lead in AI”, according to a July research paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.</p> <p>Other important datacentre projects include a £10bn scheme on the site of a former coal-fired power station near Blyth in Northumberland that was granted planning permission in March. It is poised to be at the heart of a UK-US deal involving Nvidia and OpenAI. It was also reported at the weekend that Google is in early-stage talks about building a mammoth datacentre on Teesside.</p> <p>Bain &amp; Company, a global business consultancy, said on Monday that AI and datacentres could account for 2% of global emissions and 17% of industrial emissions by 2035, with the impact highest in countries where fossil fuels still dominate power generation.</p> <p>Google declined to comment on its planning application for the Thurrock site. On Teesside, it said: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The thinking behind Sainsbury’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">£1bn-plus purchase of Argos back in 2016</a> wasn’t entirely other-worldly. The big idea was that, by putting Argos general merchandise shops within Sainsbury’s supermarkets, both chains would benefit via a customer crossover effect. But the problem was also screamingly obvious: why volunteer to step in front of Amazon’s non-food steamroller?</p> <p>Simon Roberts became chief executive of Sainsbury’s in 2020, replacing Mike Coupe, the architect of the Argos deal, and immediately indicated where he stood. His “food first” strategy wasn’t quite a declaration that he viewed Argos as inessential to the day job of competing with Tesco et al, but it wasn’t far off.</p> <p>Thus nobody was surprised by Sainsbury’s confirmation on Saturday that it was considering an approach for Argos from JD.com, the enormous Chinese retailer. The identity of the would-be buyer was logical – JD.com <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/19/currys-shares-soar-china-jd-com-takeover-battle-elliott\">publicly flirted with the idea of bidding for electrical chain Curry’s last year</a> and is still thought to be keen on a splashy entry into the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">Sainsbury’s talks to sell Argos to Chinese retailer JD.com collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunday, however, brought news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">the talks were off</a> already because, said Sainsbury’s, JD.com would only engage on “materially revised terms and commitments”. In negotiation-speak, that’s like calling the other side a bunch of time-wasters. The talks look properly dead. Everybody knows Argos isn’t worth what it was in 2016, but it’s still a substantial business.</p> <p>There is still a possible upside to the messy weekend saga for those Sainsbury’s investors who view Argos as unwanted baggage. The mere fact of talks suggests Argos has not become so enmeshed in Sainsbury’s infrastructure that the business could never be separated and sold.</p> <p>Of the 664 Argos shops, 461 are within a Sainsbury’s store, so a divorce would still be tricky. But more and more of Argos’s trade is going online, so perhaps there is still somebody out there who would want the 200-odd rump stand-alone shops, allowing Sainsbury’s to take back its store space to put to better use.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s doesn’t reveal Argos’s profits, but <a href=\"https://corporate.sainsburys.co.uk/media/s4giiar0/j-sainsbury-plc_more-argos-more-often_nl24-2.pdf\">the detail-free charts</a> it occasionally publishes suggest margins are slim (certainly slimmer than in the supermarkets) and have been getting slimmer in recent years. On the other hand, turnover at Argos is almost £5bn and digitalisation has happened, so perhaps there is still an appeal for somebody.</p> <p>For Roberts, Argos is best viewed as a low-level headache. Its presence is annoying for shareholders who would prefer a pure grocery-only story, especially now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/20/natwest-buy-sainsburys-bank-deal\">Sainsbury’s has sold most of its bank</a>. But the core supermarket business isn’t obviously being distracted – and the weekend update confirmed this year’s expectations on operating profit and cashflow, which helped the share price. The worry is more the medium-term one that, one day, the demand on Argos to stand on its own feet internally will become impossible to maintain.</p> <p>It would have been better if Argos had never been bought in the first place because the competitive pressure in non-food is relentless. But it is still fair to turn down offers at silly prices. Roberts has a couple of years to find an alternative – either a self-help fix of Argos or a sale on respectable terms. The task is not easy, but nor should it be impossible.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dancer and later chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet who took leading roles at the Wallace Collection and then Strawberry Hill House in London</p>",
    "content": "<p>Derek Purnell, who has died aged 71 of a brain tumour, had a career focused on the arts and heritage encompassing both performance and administration. He had a true sense of purpose and the ability to inspire his colleagues, and always took an interest in their work.</p> <p>In 1991 he took up the position of chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB), working alongside Peter Wright, the artistic director, and from 1995 with David Bintley. In a tribute, Bintley noted that the decade he worked alongside Purnell at the BRB was “the happiest and most fulfilling of my professional life”. Having danced with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, the touring wing of the Royal Ballet, for a decade from 1973, and having become a dancers’ union representative, when Purnell retired from performing he trained in arts administration at City, University of London. </p> <p>He then returned to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, where he managed the company’s 1988 tour to Asia, and was given the task of organising the relocation of the company to Birmingham to make its home at the Hippodrome. Knowing the working conditions dancers aspired to having danced at theatres with less-than-ideal backstage facilities, he ensured appropriate studios and custom-built facilities were provided there. </p>    <p>He became a valued ambassador for Birmingham as a place to work, reassuring the dancers and staff who would be leaving London. In 1990 the move was complete, and the company became Birmingham Royal Ballet. Purnell also played a leading role in securing BRB’s independence from the Royal Opera House.</p> <p>In 2005 he moved from Birmingham to a small village in Norfolk, and began a career as a freelance consultant. He helped to promote the arts in the county and worked with Norfolk Dance. During this period he suffered with and recovered from from throat cancer. </p> <p>When the opportunity to join the Wallace Collection as director of public engagement arose in 2014, he moved to London. At this museum housing fine art in Manchester Square, off Oxford Street, he championed collaborations between art, music and dance and encouraged the development of outreach programmes. </p> <p>Three years later he became chief operations officer. He missed being involved with events, so in July 2020 he became director of Strawberry Hill House and Gardens, Twickenham. Strawberry Hill, Horrace Walpole’s 18th-century gothic house had been lovingly restored in the decade from 2004 and Purnell knew he had to balance preserving the building and keeping it alive. </p> <p>He enjoyed being involved in making new acquisitions and loans; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/may/07/catherine-de-medici-1561-portrait-to-return-to-london-mansion\">a portrait of Catherine de Medici,</a> whom Walpole admired, was added to the gallery, and a fishtub from Walpole’s collection – in which his cat was said to have drowned, inspiring Thomas Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.thomasgray.org/texts/poems/odfc\">Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes </a>– was also displayed.</p> <p>Purnell supported a range of exhibitions both in the house and online, including one on gothic toy theatres, and community activities in the garden.</p> <p>Born and brought up in Bristol, Derek claimed that the port city aroused his curiosity about history. He was the younger of two sons of Betty (nee Cornish), an office worker, and John Purnell, who worked for Rolls-Royce. Derek was educated at Monks Park comprehensive, where he enjoyed the benefit of inspiring teachers of English and art; he also studied ballet, taking classes with Bettie Vowles.</p>    <p>At 16 he was accepted into the Royal Ballet upper school, from where he graduated to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet in 1973. He was a versatile performer whose height was an advantage. At one performance he would mime older characters including the Duke of Courland in Giselle or the Russian Merchant in Léonide Massine’s La Boutique Fantasque, at the next he revealed his technical skills in the pas de six from Les Rendezvous, the Gypsy Girl’s Lover in The Two Pigeons, Lysander in The Dream and even a Tomato in Pas de Légumes – all ballets by Frederick Ashton. </p> <p>Purnell was also noted for dancing choreography by George Balanchine. While a leading dancer in the corps de ballet, he was chosen for the male lead, partnering Vyvyan Lorrayne, in Concerto Barocco, of which the Times critic wrote: “Derek Purnell in the slow movement supports her with a wholly admirable reticence, almost achieving the illusion that it is Bach’s music rather than his arms causing her to soar above the stage.”</p> <p>In 1974 he married Elizabeth Cunliffe, a dancer and Benesh movement notator, with whom he had a daughter, Louise. That marriage was dissolved, and in 1982 he married Aileen Morrison, a viola player who worked with many orchestras. They met when she was playing with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet orchestra. Their daughter Kirsty now teaches on several dance outreach programmes.</p> <p>Purnell retained his love of dance, serving as a governor of the Royal Ballet, and was active on several committees, including serving as vice-chair of the board of trustees of the Royal Academy of Dance. In 2024 Purnell was on the verge of taking up the position of executive director of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.</p> <p>He is survived by Aileen and his two daughters.</p> <p>• Derek James Purnell, dancer and arts administrator, born 5 April 1954; died 2 August 2025</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/giant-rock-hudson-james-dean-elizabeth-taylor-epic-family-drama",
    "description": "<p>Hudson, Dean and Elizabeth Taylor make a thrilling trio in this decades-spanning saga set on a scorching Texan ranch</p>",
    "content": "<p>“I think Rock Hudson worked best with a big background,” says film historian Steve Hayes in a biography of the Hollywood heart-throb, “in a big melodrama against a big landscape”. It doesn’t get much bigger than George Stevens’ three-and-a-half-hour epic Giant, starring the towering Hudson – who stood 6ft 5in at the height of his fame.</p> <p>Adapted from Edna Ferber’s 1952 bestseller of the same name, Giant is a film of great conscience and scale, tracing multiple decades of a southern family reckoning with social and political tailwinds on their ranch. Often described as the national movie of Texas, Giant actually begins further east in the state of Maryland where Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr (Hudson) has journeyed to buy a horse fit for his 595,000 acres of land. There he meets and quickly marries debutante Leslie Lynnton, played by a young Elizabeth Taylor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elMP6PqGBo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/elMP6PqGBo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Without second thought, the well-mannered, equestrian flower of the east – a clear case of typecasting for Taylor, who earlier won hearts as a teenage horse-whisperer in National Velvet – leaves it all behind for a life saddled at Bick’s side on his grand cattle ranch under the flaming Texan sun.</p> <p>“Hot? It was about 120 degrees in the shade!” Taylor <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=7L1PbtXSjClZrgxh&amp;v=pV2HaQtqy4M&amp;feature=youtu.be\">said of the storied summer shoot</a>, which took a horrific turn when co-star Mercedes McCambridge was seriously scarred after make-up melted into her skin, burning her neck. Ironically, it’s McCambridge’s Luz, Bick Benedict’s spinster sister, that is most at home in these scorching conditions. Early in the film, Luz hosts an outdoor barbecue on a sweltering day to welcome her new sister-in-law to the community, which includes the avoidant ranch-hand Jett Rink – played by Giant’s true star James Dean. Luz’s friendly hazing sees Leslie faint before the entire town. As an easterner, her blood is “too thin” for Texas.</p> <p>Yet from the moment of her arrival, Leslie’s presence brings about an important shift in the town. Unlike her husband, she shows basic respect for Mexican workers on the ranch – her progressive instincts no doubt a reflection of the political upbringing she received as an upper-class girl in the more progressive Maryland.</p>    <p>In the many years it spans, Giant endeavours to form a political picture of the south, from early debates between the newlyweds over the status of Texas as a “stolen state” to the penultimate scene where Bick brawls with a small-business owner refusing service to a Mexican family. The great accomplishment of the story is that it is one where a man of great stature admits that he was wrong.</p> <p>The other primary thread in Giant<em> </em>is the making of another man – Jett – into an emperor. With his humble beginnings as a worker on Bick’s station, Jett comes into a great fortune when he discovers the small share of the ranch bequeathed to him by the late Luz sits above an oil well. His realisation is a moment of spectacular eruption: the well ejaculates suddenly, spraying his humble plot with glorious black grease. Jett is going to be a very wealthy man – the consequences of which become clear as the years tick by and characters age.</p> <p>Early in the casting process Stevens made the unusual decision to hire actors in their 20s as his three leads, each of which would go on to play their characters in middle age during Giant’s second act. In his transformation, Hudson, who was 28 at the time, wore a 50-pound belt as padding around his waist. He and the 23-year-old Taylor wore substantial make-up to create the illusion – and yet it was Dean, as a greying oil tycoon, that transformed most convincingly. The actor refused the same cosmetics as his co-stars, arguing that “a man of 45 shows his age in thoughts and actions, not in wrinkles”. Dean’s performance – informed by his time in Texas with real cowboys – is a masterclass in swagger, down to Jett’s speech pattern and the way he wears his big hat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/13/hooper-the-film-that-turned-the-stuntman-into-a-movie-star\">Hooper: the film that turned the stuntman into a movie star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a reliquary of three of Hollywood’s brightest stars, Giant also imagines an alternate history where Hudson, Taylor and Dean were allowed to age alongside one another. Hudson died of Aids in the mid-80s, becoming one of the first beloved public figures associated with the disease. Fans across the world were shocked to find their hero reduced to a sick old man, sadly more sick than he was old. Needless to say, James Dean never aged beyond Giant. He famously crashed his race car in California shortly after filming was complete. Taylor was the only one who survived well into the 21st century in a life defined by both richesse and heartbreak, alternatingly assailed and adored by the public eye until her death, aged 79.</p> <p>Witnessing the trio in Giant now feels like summoning ghosts. When 200 minutes have elapsed and the film is finally over, it’s almost a disappointment. Thanks to the cavalcade of great heroes that descended on Marfa, Texas, back in 1955, the night sky of the Lone Star state never looked so bright.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Giant is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US.

For some teams the high number of tackles might be a pointer to the opposition having their hands on the ball more often, but for the Pies it is a reminder that their miserly defence begins with a combativeness at the contest and being the best team in the competition for pressure all over the field. Even with a side packed with players aged on the high side of 30, the Magpies are likely to hit the ground fresh and full of running in what will be just their second game in 29 days.</p>    <p>Brisbane will have to take the long route to reach the grand final but showed last year that they can overcome that hurdle with four straight finals victories on the way to premiership glory. A return to the MCG should hold few fears for the Lions who won five in a row at the venue before a surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">lacklustre display in the qualifying final defeat</a> to Geelong. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/13/afl-semi-final-brisbane-lions-gold-coast-suns-match-report\">The reigning premiers bounced back</a> the following week – as they have so often done after a defeat this year – to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">thump bitter rivals Gold Coast</a> with a reminder of how freely they can score when their midfield and forward line click.</p> <p>The Lions will miss the injured Lachie Neale for a second week in a row but showed in the resounding win over the Suns that they have enough depth to still compete with – and even overpower – the strongest onball brigades. The reigning premiers are the best of the remaining four teams for clearances with an average of 40.4 a game, as well as for clearance differential (+4.7), and built their victory at the coalface with 51-34 clearances the last time they took on the Magpies.</p> <h2>Game shapers</h2> <p><strong>Collingwood: Steele Sidebottom – </strong>the Magpies veteran was considering retirement at times last year but again looks to have plenty left in his legs as he lines up for a 28th final and ninth preliminary final. The 34-year-old has booted 15 goals and averaged 21.4 disposals this year but it is Sidebottom’s ability to make an impact when the game is on the line that continues to set him apart. The versatile midfielder broke the game open when booting three of the Pies’ five goals as they snatched back the lead from the Crows and then powered away either side of the main break in a burst that set up their qualifying final win. Sidebottom might not have the pace that he once did but the player who booted the Magpies’ last goal in the 2023 grand final victory over the Lions has more than enough class and composure to remain a match-turning threat.</p>    <p><strong>Brisbane: Cam Rayner – </strong>the Lions dynamo has become a September specialist as he rises to the occasion in finals whether settling forward or mixing in bursts in the midfield. Rayner came under fire for the way he went to ground easily to earn a pair of contentious free kicks during the qualifying loss to Geelong but responded in the best possible way against Gold Coast with his brute force on full display. The 25-year-old shrugged off eight Suns tackles during the semi-final including stepping out of one before launching a long bomb to goal from barely in front of the centre circle. When Rayner plays well, the Lions tend to win, making the prospect of a match-up with rugged Pies defender Brayden Maynard likely to be pivotal to the result – and mouth-watering for fans.</p> <h2>Early prediction</h2> <p>Collingwood need no reminder of the threat that Brisbane pose when they are at their best but can turn to refreshed veterans to edge the reigning premiers in another finals classic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Claims on social media feeds are that synthetic hormones cause infertility and affect romantic choices. Experts say unintended pregnancies have reached ‘concerning levels’</p><ul><li><p>Read more in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral series</a></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>In the 1960s it was considered a watershed moment of liberation for women. Now, a new generation is being inundated with messages online that birth control is “evil” and “poison”. Across social media feeds, influencers are venting about hormonal contraception. Some are spreading false claims that taking synthetic hormones causes infertility, or can even be responsible for bad romantic decisions because you are “attracted to different men than you would be if you were off the pill”. Others emphasise known side-effects, such as weight gain and depression.</p> <p>Meanwhile, millions of TikToks promote the effectiveness of natural contraceptive methods, with self-described “hormone experts” claiming it is “not that hard to prevent pregnancy naturally” with fertility awareness methods “just as effective, if not more effective than the birth control pill.”</p> <p>Experts such as Dr Sarah White, the CEO of Jean Hailes for Women’s Health, say the “misinformation is extraordinary” and are seriously concerned about the potential consequences for women.</p> <h2>What is this trend?</h2> <p>Researchers at La Trobe University <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psrh.70025\">analysed 100 TikTok videos</a> from the top five hashtags related to contraception methods (#birthcontrol, #contraception, #thepill, #naturalbirthcontrol, and #cycletracking) that had collectively gained nearly 5bn views and 14.6m likes.</p> <p>They found that more than half of the video creators (53%) explicitly rejected hormonal birth control, and more than one in three (34%) expressed a distrust about healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, 38% endorsed fertility tracking, often without disclosing the limitations of this method.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/03/what-is-carnivore-diet-meat-benefits-science-does-work-why-so-many-influencers\">A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | Antiviral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White says the popularity of this kind of material is being driven by a number of factors: a wellness industry that often encourages women to not put anything unnatural in their bodies, a younger generation of women being increasingly sceptical of their doctors pushing pharmaceuticals, and a social media environment that rewards inflammatory statements and fear-based messaging. There is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/the-pill-hasnt-been-improved-in-years-no-wonder-women-are-giving-up-on-it\">conservative backlash against birth control.</a></p> <h2>Do ‘natural’ contraceptive methods work?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/contraception/fertility-awareness-based-methods-contraception-lactational\">Fertility awareness-based contraceptive methods</a> aim to identify the fertile window by tracking biomarkers for ovulation, such as basal body temperature and cervical mucus, to avoid a pregnancy. The method can be up to 99% effective when used correctly, but when it isn’t, almost one in four users will get pregnant over a year, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/natural-family-planning/\">according to the UK’s National Health Service.</a></p> <p>Prof Danielle Mazza, a practising GP and the head of Monash University’s department of general practice, says many women find it hard to determine when the fertile period of their cycle actually is. She says basal body temperature tracking is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/colossally-naive-backlash-birth-control-app\">not a good way to prevent pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>Even for women who have a very regular cycle and feel confident identifying their fertile window, the method still relies on several additional factors to work, she says. They have to be prepared to forego sex for considerable periods of time during the month, as well as spontaneity in their sex lives. They also have to have a partner who’s not coercive or violent, and they must make sure they don’t have sex when they’re inebriated or under the influence, Mazza says.</p> <h2>What about side effects of hormonal contraception?</h2> <p>Hormonal contraception is one of the most researched medications, Mazza says. “The majority of women can use these forms of medication very happily, with very few side-effects.”</p> <p>Known <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/side-effects-and-risks-of-hormonal-contraception/\">side-effects of hormonal birth control</a> include headaches, nausea, mood swings, weight gain, sore breasts and acne. However, social media can amplify individual negative experiences, with research showing young people in particular often believe that a lived experience is just as credible as advice from a trained professional, White says.</p> <p>If women are unhappy with the side-effects they are experiencing, Mazza encourages them to talk to their doctor rather than discarding contraception, because there are <a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/individuals/contraception\">different methods of effective contraception</a> that could suit them better. “It’s very important to come back for review, because also a lot of women can attribute symptoms to the pill or other hormonal forms of contraception, whereas there might be other reasons why they’re getting those kinds of symptoms.”</p> <p>Mazza also highlights that some side-effects can be transient. For example, breast tenderness or feelings of fullness when you start the pill are common, but usually subside within a few months. She says she does not know of any research to prove claims that women are attracted to men they wouldn’t be attracted to if they were off the pill.</p> <h2>What do experts recommend?</h2> <p>Dr Caroline de Moel-Mandel, the lead author of the La Trobe University study and a GP, says women often feel they aren’t listened to in clinical settings. As a result, if they feel pressed into accepting a particular contraceptive method, they might search for an alternative or talk about it and seek validation online from women who feel the same way, “and it becomes a cycle”.</p> <p>“The platform offers women a space to talk about their side-effects, or their distrust or their frustrations that they have with the pill, or maybe even with the consultations that they had with their doctors,” Moel-Mandel says.</p> <p>“Women need to be part of that decision-making process,” with their own lived experience being validated alongside their doctor’s medical perspective, she says. Other barriers, such as appointments being too expensive, also need to be addressed.</p> <p>White also emphasises that data shows – at least in the Australian context – that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/27/australian-women-lagging-on-use-of-iuds-due-to-education-failure-experts-say\">level of knowledge around contraception is very low</a>. Many women are worried about short- and long-term side-effects of hormonal contraception. As a result, she says, there is “a concerning level of unintended pregnancy”.</p> <p>“Being able to choose when to get pregnant is really, really, really critical for a woman’s health and her economic security.” But White stresses that “you can’t make an informed choice if you’re being misled.”</p> <p>• Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral</a> is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"bb8fc08d-d44b-4ccf-9d6c-c259975cf0a5\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>",

    "description": "<p>Survey of 12,000 women also revealed severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across menstrual cycle</p>",
    "content": "<p>Women with long Covid are prone to longer, heavier periods, which could put them at greater risk of iron deficiency that exacerbates common symptoms of the condition, doctors say.</p> <p>The findings emerged from a UK survey of more than 12,000 women, which also found that the severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across the menstrual cycle and became worse when women had their periods.</p> <p>Preliminary tests revealed hormonal changes and excessive inflammation of the womb lining in women with long Covid, but more work is needed to establish the knock-on effects. There was no evidence that long Covid harmed ovary function.</p> <p>The work points to a two-way effect, with long Covid affecting women’s periods and hormonal changes over the menstrual cycle affecting the severity of long Covid symptoms.</p> <p>“Our hope is that this will allow us to develop really specific treatments for women with long Covid who are suffering with menstrual disturbance,” said Dr Jacqueline Maybin, a reader and honorary consultant gynaecologist at the University of Edinburgh. “It may also lead to female-specific treatments for long Covid itself, which we know can be quite prevalent in women of reproductive age.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6\">estimated 400 million people</a> worldwide either have long Covid or have recovered from the condition. Nearly 2 million people in England alone self-report as living with long Covid, defined as symptoms that persist for at least four weeks after catching the virus.</p> <p>Doctors have recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/15/long-covid-has-more-than-200-symptoms-study-finds\">more than 200 long Covid symptoms</a>, but the most common include fatigue, brain fog, difficulty breathing, digestive issues, headaches and changes to smell and taste. The ailments appear to be driven by an array of problems, from residual infection and ongoing inflammation to disruption of the immune system and mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cells.</p> <p>Maybin and her colleagues analysed data from 12,187 UK women who completed an online survey between March and May 2021. More than 1,000 had long Covid, while more than 1,700 had recovered from the virus. More than 9,400 had never tested positive for Covid.</p> <p>Women with long Covid had longer, heavier periods and more bleeding between their periods than other women, the researchers found. A follow-up survey with 54 women revealed that the severity of their symptoms fluctuated over the menstrual cycle and worsened in the two days before and during their periods.</p> <p>The researchers went on to analyse blood from 10 women with long Covid. Tests revealed inflammation in the womb lining and higher-than-usual levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone. Both could be drivers of heavier periods.</p> <p>Importantly, according to the study in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62965-7\">Nature Communications</a>, the tests found no evidence that long Covid harmed the normal functioning of the ovaries.</p> <p>Many women of child-bearing age are iron-deficient, and heavy periods often contribute to the issue. This leads to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness, all of which are common in long Covid. “If you have long Covid on top of iron deficiency, it’s unsurprising that these women are really debilitated and unable to function,” Maybin said.</p> <p>Dr Viki Male, who studies reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said inflammation in the uterus was associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, so this could be the link between long Covid and prolonged or heavy periods. “Anti-inflammatory drugs are already used to treat heavy periods, so these findings suggest they might also be helpful for people who experience heavy menstrual bleeding as a symptom of long Covid,” she said.</p>",

In the traditional knockout format, only first, second and third are guaranteed a place in the next round, requiring Gout to be at or near his best to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">make sure his senior major debut lasts more than one race</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">‘A nobody who became really good’: Gout Gout takes his bow on the world stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The field is led by Bryan Levell, who last month recorded the third quickest 200m time in the rich history of Jamaican sprinting, behind only Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake. His 19.69sec into a slight headwind in Budapest elevated him into the medal conversation in Tokyo. But he has been consistent since winning Jamaica’s national title in June, including two sub 20.30sec runs in overseas meets before his breakout time in August.</p> \n<p>With his upright, robotic style, the 21-year-old Levell shot away early in that race in Hungary, and running inside Gout on Wednesday he is expected to heap pressure on the teenager from straight out of the blocks.</p> \n<p>Higher than Levell on the world rankings, Zimbabwean Makanakaishe Charamba made the 200m final in Paris last year. He may have finished last that day, but the 23-year-old has taken a step forward in 2025, and now has a personal best of 19.92sec which he has run twice this year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\" data-alt=\"Table showing the runners and best times in Gout Gout's 200m heat at the 2025 World Athletics Championships\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Israeli sprinter Blessing Afrifah is the only other one in the heat to have run sub-20sec and will be looking at Gout as a rival for a semi-final place.

Afrifah has struggled to go as quickly since, but his season best of 20.31sec suggests he will be in contention to make it through.</p> \n<p>Although Gout needs to finish in the top three to secure a direct place in the semi-finals, a quick fourth place is likely to get him through as one of the six next fastest qualifiers. A time of 20.44sec was enough to make the semis in Budapest. The slowest Gout has run over 200m this year was a 20.30sec at the Maurie Plant meet in his first race against adults.</p> \n<p>On that chilly Melbourne night in March, Lachie Kennedy beat him to the line in front of a capacity crowd at Lakeside.

    "content": "<p>Isn’t it funny how ingredients have entirely different connotations depending on your context?</p> <p>In the Anglosphere, cottage cheese is mid-century diet food. Served with grapefruit halves, joyless and tasteless. Richard Nixon’s last White House meal: tinned pineapple slices with an ice-cream scoop of cottage cheese and a glass of milk. Yikes.</p> <p>Yet in eastern Europe, farmhouse cheeses like cottage cheese and quark are staple inclusions that have nothing to do with weight loss fads. To me, it’s stained with sour cherry jam and washed down with Babushka’s black tea “zavarka” in a saucer. It’s bulking out the filling of Mum’s khachapuri. And, if I’m lucky, it means syrniki – AKA tvorozhniki for breakfast – using up any old dairy in the fridge, but especially cottage cheese, to make our version of ricotta hotcakes.</p>    <p>Of course, context can change over time too; and even western palates are growing fond of this fresh fromage. Cottage cheese has become a feature of some of this year’s most viral recipes, from protein-packed super bowls to two-ingredient GF wraps (the other ingredient is eggs). As a result, many countries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/07/cottage-cheese-shortage-australia-tiktok-viral-recipes\">experiencing shortages</a>.</p> <p>Luckily, there are plenty of uninitiated folk who are seeing the cottage cheese shelf empty and wandering off, without giving a quick glance nearby to find its kissing cousin: quark! Say it like the sound a posh duck would make.</p> <p>While they’re both fresh cheeses, quark and cottage cheese are made quite differently. Some cottage cheese is cultured to help it set, but it’s more likely to be acidified with vinegar or lemon juice like ricotta. There can be a lot of variation between brands and styles of cottage cheese, depending on where you are in the world.</p>    <p>As this product has traditionally been relegated to the “diet” section of western supermarkets, it’s often made using skim or low-fat milk, which can affect the flavour and make the texture a little more watery. Rather than seeking out a low-fat label like it’s 1985, look for the cheese with the fewest ingredients, keeping an eye out for additions like thickeners and gums, as well as flavourings and salt content.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <p>Quark is always made with Lactobacillus cultures, like yoghurt, along with microbial rennet (as you would for other cheeses). As a result quark changes more in texture and flavour, depending on the season and the milk. I spoke with one of my favourite quark suppliers and they said: “Because we pasteurise low and slow and unhomogenised, our quark is generally smooth – but being small-batch and seasonal, it can change depending on the milk, the weather and, yes, who’s on the tools that day.”</p>    <p>You can probably guess which product is my pick, though you can pretty reliably sub one in for the other the next time you’re inspired to try a “cottage cheese hack” from the internet – including in this recipe. The only difference you might find is that low-fat cottage cheese can get a little weepy and split due to all the thickeners and gums going goopy under heat, so in those recipes, low real estate labels and/or quark are your friend.</p> <p>For this recipe, I’m taking inspiration from the sweet syrniki Mum makes for breakfast and the savoury pelmeni Dad makes for dinner (bought frozen from the shops then pumped up with caramelised onion, sour cream and dill).</p>    <p>I’ve kept the syrniki super light by treating them more like ricotta gnudi, shaping them, then letting them sit on the gluten-free flour until they form a skin. Because it’s gluten free, you don’t have to worry about overworking the gluten, which means you can really ensure that the ingredients are evenly mixed together. With a diligent fry on either side, the batter then sets while the inside stays tender. The golden onion slices (sweated down low and slow until they change colour) are enriched with sour cream for a simple sweet-savoury-tangy sauce that brings everything together.</p>    <p>Cracked caraway is the surprise hero here, taking these from a simple breakfast stack to a sophisticated dinner dumpling, with notes of Borodinsky rye. Mind you, that’s just my frame of reference. My home economist Jane Grylls visited when we were cooking these and described the eating experience as “Russian dimmies” (that’s dim sum for those outside Australia) because they’re so savoury and satisfying. If you can’t find caraway seeds, fennel seeds will give you a similar enough vibe to save a trip to the shops.</p>    <p>These can be made in advance and reheated to serve, or eaten cold for brunch al desko, so you can nix the paltry pineapple slices and blob of bland forever.</p> <h2>Savoury syrniki with caraway and caramelised onion – recipe</h2>    <p>Serves: <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>40g butter</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>1 brown onion</strong>, thinly sliced into half-moons against the grain<br><strong>½ tsp caraway seeds, </strong>or fennel seeds, crushed<br><strong>¼ tsp salt flakes<br>1 egg<br>500g quark</strong> (or full-fat cottage cheese)<br><strong>100g gluten-free self-raising flour, </strong>50g for the syrniki and 50g for dusting<br><strong>300g sour cream<br>¼ bunch of dill, fronds picked, stems finely chopped<br>Freshly ground white pepper</strong></p> <p>In a wide, heavy-based pan, melt the butter and oil together, then pop in the onion (along with a pinch of sugar if you’re that way inclined) and listen for the sizzle on medium heat. Once you hear the sizzle, drop the heat to medium-low and whack a lid on, along with a timer for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Crush your caraway seeds with the salt in a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, pop the seeds and salt in the base of a large mixing bowl and use the bottom of a bottle (like wine or olive oil) for crushing.</p> <p>Mix together the crushed seeds and salt, along with the egg, quark and 50g of flour.</p> <p>On a medium sized tray sprinkle over the other 50g of flour. Use two tablespoons to blob out walnut-in-shell-sized amounts of batter into the flour, shaking it about to coat them. Leave them on the tray for five to 10 minutes to keep soaking up more starch while you wait for the onion to caramelise (this’ll help them form a crust).</p> <p>Once the onion has fried and turned golden brown with little flecks of caramelisation on the tips, pull it out into a bowl, trying to keep as much oil and butter in the pan as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/11/alice-zaslavskys-crisp-topped-tuna-nicoise-mornay-tuna-pasta-bake-recipe\">Alice Zaslavsky’s crisp-topped tuna niçoise mornay (tuna pasta bake) – recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If need be, add another knob of butter and oil as you go, and fry the batter balls for three to four minutes each side on a medium heat until browned top and bottom.</p> <p>Pull the dumplings out of the pan on to a lined tray and pop a tea towel on top to keep them warm but not schvitzy.</p> <p>To finish the sauce, wipe any gunky bits out of the pan, then pop the caramelised onions back in on a low heat, stirring through the dill stalks, most of the sour cream and a good helping of freshly ground white pepper.

It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favour and stand up for journalists’ first amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”</p> <p>The suit makes a series of verbose claims about Trump’s achievements, wealth and skill on the television show The Apprentice. It claims he secured “the greatest personal and political achievement in American history” with his election win, while accusing the NYT of trying to damage his “worldwide reputation for success”.</p> <p>It states The Apprentice was a success because of “President Trump’s sui generis charisma and unique business acumen”. It describes his father, Fred C Trump, as “a legendary businessman and a patriot”.</p> <p>“Thereafter, President Trump’s stewardship of the Trump Organization has made it and the Trump name synonymous not only with New York City real estate but also with worldwide excellence, luxury, and opulence,” it states, taking issue with the NYT’s reporting of his business dealings.</p> <p>The suit accuses the NYT, as well as other “legacy media” regarded as opponents, of engaging in election interference. It points to the paper’s decision to endorse the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the last presidential race.</p> <p>The NYT made the endorsement while other major outlets took the unusual move of refusing to endorse a candidate in the race. The Washington Post, owned by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, opted against endorsing a candidate. That decision was criticised by some as an attempt to appease Trump and led to a backlash among subscribers and Post employees.</p> <p>The case against the NYT is just the latest of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits Trump has launched against US media outlets since his return to the White House.</p> <p>Lawsuits have been brought against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million\">ABC News and the anchor George Stephanopoulos</a>, as well as Paramount over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris\">60 Minutes interview with Harris</a>. Those cases were settled for $15m and $16m respectively. The case against the Wall Street Journal is ongoing.</p> <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump denounced the NYT as “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party”.</p> <p>“I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER,” he said, though he did not provide any evidence for the claim. “Their Endorsement of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!</p> <p>“The ‘Times’ has engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation as a whole.”</p> <p>The lawsuit cites articles in the NYT based on Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, a book by the reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner.</p> <p>“Defendants maliciously published the book and the articles knowing that these publications were filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump,” the filing states. Penguin Random House, the publisher of the book, which is also being sued as part of the action, has not yet commented on the suit.</p> <p>Articles in the NYT to be cited in the filing include one published before the November election, which was described as an “election-interfering salvo”. The suit says the articles were part of a long-term pattern of “intentional and malicious defamation”. It seeks damages of “not less than $15bn”.</p> <p>Trump’s team has previously filed a libel suit against the NYT in relation to an opinion article concerning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/trump-campaign-sues-new-york-times-for-libel-over-russia-story\">Russian interference in the 2016 US election</a>. It was dismissed on the grounds of “protected speech”.</p> <p>Trump also has sued the newspaper and his estranged niece over a 2018 story about his family’s wealth and tax arrangements, describing it as an “insidious plot” to obtain his records. A New York judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/donald-trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-mary-trump\">threw out the case</a> in 2023.</p>",

Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p> <p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrissey </strong>adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rachel Vahey, </strong>head of public policy at <strong>AJ Bell, </strong>points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p> <p><strong>Vahey </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p> <p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p> </blockquote> <p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary <strong>Liz</strong> <strong>Kendall</strong> said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/21/britain-is-facing-a-tsunami-of-pensioner-poverty-says-kendall\">Britain is facing a ‘tsunami’ of pensioner poverty, says Kendall</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:28:15.564Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c90a1e8f084793c7c162af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:07:01.551Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK jobs data: political reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The UK’s new Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has spotted some bright spots in today’s labour market reports.</strong></p> <p>He points to a drop in the economic inactivity rate (people neither in work nor looking for a job), which dipped by 0.02 percentage points over the last quarter to 21.1%.</p> <p><strong>McFadden </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Today’s figures show signs of progress with economic inactivity and redundancies continuing to fall.</p> <p>“But we must futureproof our workforce by giving people the opportunities and skills they need to secure the jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>“It is vital that our £240 million Get Britain Working plan is felt by people across the country, whether it’s through targeted support for young people entering the workforce, or joining up work, health and skills support.</p> <p>“The true strength of the UK’s economy lies in the British people, which is why we are unlocking opportunity in every part of the country to drive forward economic growth under our plan for change.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Daisy</strong> <strong>Cooper</strong>, the <strong>Liberal</strong> <strong>Democrat</strong> Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. </p> <p><strong>Cooper</strong> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c904a68f084793c7c16289\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T06:47:12.509Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JLR production pause extended until Wednesday 24 September</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jaguar Land Rover has extended the shutdown of its car production for another week, as it continues to reel from a disruptive cyber attack.</strong></p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> says it told its staff, suppliers and partners today that it has extended the current pause in our production until Wednesday 24 September.</p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p> <p>We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company’s factory lines have already been frozen for two weeks, since JLR’s manufacturing and retailing activities were “severely disrupted” by a cyber incident.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Last week, JLR revealed the hack had affected ‘some’ of its data</a>.</p> <p>The disruption is hurting the company’s suppliers;

    "description": "<p>Lauren Choi wanted to give plastic a second life. Her experiment turned into The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.</p> <p>But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019, during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw material.</p> <p>Choi then took a weaving class at a Baltimore, Maryland, maker space so she could make a sample fabric out of those filaments. That became the foundation for The New Norm, a textile company that today transforms a variety of post-consumer recycled plastic into stylish sweatshirts and beanies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/modernize-trade-trumps-tariffs\">At 23, she set out to modernize the spice trade. Now she’s navigating Trump’s tariffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’ve always thought long-term,” Choi said. “And that helps me look beyond the next couple years, [to the] bigger picture, where globally, [the plastic crisis] is something we need to address.”</p> <p>The company is a natural extension of Choi’s longstanding concern about the dual climate and plastics crises and a deep connection to fashion. She had been sewing since she was a child, interned at a swimwear company earlier in college, and – before teaming up with classmates – spent a summer trying to build an extruder machine in her parents’ garage. “[The New Norm] really tied my interests together,” she said.</p> <p>After graduating in 2020, Choi raised grant funding so she could dive more into product development. “That helped it go from a passion project to a real, real project,” she said.</p>    <p>Choi started working with suppliers who source plastics from recycling facilities across the country. “Recycled [materials are] still the wild west,” she said. “We received batches that were unusable or contaminated or too mixed. It was a lot of trial and error to find the right people.”</p> <p>Another challenge: Up until that point, the fabric coming out of the extruder still had a distinctly brittle, plastic feel – it didn’t feel wearable like a traditional textile. So Choi reached out to Gaston College’s Textile Technology Center, just outside Charlotte, North Carolina, for help.</p> <p>“If you’re going to produce a knit garment, it needs to be comfortable,” said Jasmine Cox, the center’s executive director. “It needs to be breathable, cozy, things that people love. It can’t feel like a plastic cup.”</p> <p>Cox’s team, along with people at the Polymers Center in North Carolina, helped Choi develop a custom formula that could be fed into extruders to produce soft textiles. “Our entire goal [was] to get her to that point where it was plug and play,” Cox said.</p> <p>It took them a couple years, and more grant funding (from Johns Hopkins, Garnier, and Reynolds Consumer Products, Hefty’s parent company, among others), to get to that point. The New Norm released its first, direct-to-consumer collection of sweaters and beanies in late 2023. Made from 5,000 upcycled party cups, the drop sold out in two months.</p> <p>Choi works with textile facilities in North Carolina and Virginia to produce The New Norm’s yarn, much of which is then shipped to Brooklyn, where a manufacturer uses 3D printers to produce sweatshirts and beanies, which retail between $45 and $85.</p> <p>“3D knitting has a lot less waste compared to traditional cut-and-sew, where many fabric scraps are wasted,” Choi said. “Instead, our pieces are knit straight out of the machine without any seams – it’s just one full garment that doesn’t need additional sewing.”</p>    <p>Even though the company now uses a variety of plastics, multicolored party cups still make up most of the raw materials in its own line. The items’ pink, blue and green pastel hues come from the cups themselves rather than added dyes. Choi said her yarn is made from continuous filaments, rather than fibers that are spun together, which means it’s less likely to shed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know\">harmful microplastics</a>.</p> <p>The New Norm is still a lean operation: Choi, who recently moved to Boston to pursue an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said at any given time there are between three and 25 people working at the company. She declined to share sales figures, but said that in the last two years production had expanded from tens of pounds per run to thousands.</p> <p>Choi said she aims to expand the business-to-business side of The New Norm, which she sees as offering the biggest opportunity for an environmental impact.</p> <p>“From the beginning, our goal has been to get to a place where we can scale production and work with really large brands who are using significant quantities of materials,” she said. The New Norm is undergoing pilots with large brands, testing everything from the strength of the yarn to how well it launders, with the goal of developing and selling the material at a much larger scale.</p> <p>This aligns with where some experts see the industry going, as a growing number of companies rethink where they source their raw materials. One <a href=\"https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/sustainable-fabrics-market-9619?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">report</a> found that the sustainable textile market was valued globally at $29.5bn in 2024, and is expected to hit $71bn by 2031. (While what constitutes “sustainable” is somewhat nebulous, most research defines it as textiles made with eco-friendly material, including recycled fibers, which minimize water, chemicals, and carbon emissions.)</p> <p>For her part, Choi hopes The New Norm can put a dent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns\">global plastics crisis</a>, which has reached disastrous levels. The world produces 200 times as much plastic today as it did in 1950, less than 10% of which is recycled. There’s an estimated 8bn tons of plastic pollution across the globe, and just three plastic chemicals cause as much as $1.5tn in annual health costs.</p> <p>Cox said Choi was early in terms of thinking about how to transform plastic into textile. And while there are other companies that turn plastic and textile waste into yarn, Cox said Choi’s focus on the party cup was unique, especially because of where it could lead. “Food containers, food packaging, that’s something that we don’t think about,” she said. “Everyone throws it out daily, and there haven’t been many solutions.”</p> <p>Some might question if we really want to be wearing clothes made out of plastic, but the reality is we already are. More than 60% of fibers produced worldwide are synthetic, the vast majority of which are derived from virgin fossil fuels, according to a 2024 report from <a href=\"https://2d73cea0.delivery.rocketcdn.me/app/uploads/2024/09/Materials-Market-Report-2024.pdf\">Textile Exchange</a>, making the fashion industry a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cox and Choi both acknowledged how much needs to be done to reduce plastic usage, but see upcycling as an important first step.</p> <p>“It would be amazing if we lived in a plastic-free world,” Choi said. “But if you look at the volume of virgin, synthetic fibers made annually, we’re talking billions of tons of material. There’s a long road to go.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The city of Birmingham lies just over 40 miles north-east of Ludlow, but to the 10,000 residents of the quiet Shropshire town, it may as well be on the moon.</p> <p>“You can’t get a bus to Birmingham today, it’s impossible. It is really just up the road, our big regional centre but there are no buses. How ridiculous is that?” said Philip Adams.</p> <p>Adams, who has lived in Ludlow for many years, remembers the bygone days of the poppy red buses of the Midland Red company toing and froing to Birmingham, until the publicly owned business was broken up in 1981 and sold off under Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation agenda.</p> <p>Today, Midland Red buses can only be found in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59827695\">transport museums</a>, and the route from Ludlow to Birmingham is most often done by car.</p> <p>Over the years since privatisation, bus companies in Shropshire have folded, risen and folded again, and the public service has collapsed.</p> <p>According to data from the thinktank Common Wealth, the county has suffered one of the biggest reductions in bus routes in the UK over the past six years, with a 60% reduction in kilometres travelled by bus.</p> <p>A survey of passenger experiences of Ludlow’s bus routes, conducted by the town’s sustainable transport group, revealed how people, particularly elderly residents, were suffering from this devastation of public transport.</p> <p>Confusing timetabling, long gaps of up to four hours between buses, and irregular service were all highlighted. “The accessibility of a regular town bus has practically been destroyed,” said one member of the public.</p> <p>According to Common Wealth’s research, the same picture is repeated across the country. Since privatisation, services have collapsed but bus and train ticket prices have risen above inflation every year since 1987.</p>    <p>More than £16bn has been paid in dividends to the owners of bus and train companies: £14.2bn since 1996 to the shareholders of the privatised train companies and £1.82bn for the shareholders of bus companies since 2007, according to Common Wealth.</p> <p>Since 2020 alone, at least £143m has been distributed to the shareholders of bus firms while the companies oversaw pre-tax losses of £53m.</p> <p>Taxpayers are shovelling money into the system to shore it up, with £2bn of additional public funding paid to bus operators in the past five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\" data-alt=\"Graphic shows bus fare rises compared with motoring costs\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Train companies are also receiving public money while handing out dividends. According to the Office of Road and Rail, the public paid £12.5bn in 2023-24 to subsidise rail companies – £4.1bn in net payments directly to operating companies and £8.3bn paid to Network Rail, which in turn further subsidises the operating companies indirectly.</p> <p>Direct and indirect subsidies to train companies enabled the operating companies and the rolling stock companies to run post-tax profits of £449m annually since the year ending March 2017.</p> <p>But much of these profits, Common Wealth says, were paid out in dividends rather than reinvested in services.</p> <p>Today getting a train from Ludlow to Birmingham is almost as difficult as spotting a bus on the route. It requires a detour 30 miles north to Shrewsbury, or 24 miles south to Hereford, to change trains for the Birmingham service.</p> <p>For passengers who use the CrossCountry trains from the south-west to Birmingham and beyond, the pain is evident. The company was ranked the worst in Britain this summer by Transport Focus, the independent watchdog for passengers, and only 41% of its services run on time.</p> <p>Ownership of the rail and bus sectors faces a shakeup by the Labour government. Train operating companies across the UK are being renationalised under the 2024 Passenger Railway Services Act, with Welsh and Scottish rail operators back in public ownership in 2021 and 2022 respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\" data-alt=\"Chart shows distance travelled by buses has reduce in 15 English local authorities\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said the rolling stock companies also needed to be returned to public ownership to ensure renationalisation led to a coherent and well-planned system.</p> <p>The bus sector is also facing an overhaul, with new legislation permitting the creation of local authority-owned bus companies once again and bringing fares, routes, timetables and connections back into public control.</p> <p>Public ownership of public transport is overwhelmingly popular. In 2024, YouGov found that 76% of the electorate backed public ownership of rail and 66% backed public ownership of bus services.</p> <p>“Passengers pay the price for privatisation through higher fares and cut-back services,” said Lawrence.</p> <p>“Public transport should be genuinely public. Money should be reinvested, not leak out the system. Vital services should be provided based on need not profit. And the fragmentation that leads to higher costs should be replaced by a coherent, public-oriented system.”</p> <p>As a member of Ludlow 21, a sustainable transport group in Shropshire, Adams agrees. “Privatisation has been a complete disaster for bus services. It just doesn’t work.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Framework deal is breakthrough in long-running dispute over app’s ownership amid security concerns in Washington</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jamieson Greer, a US trade representative, said on Monday that Washington and Beijing have struck a framework agreement on transferring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> to US-controlled ownership.</p> <p>Speaking after emerging from negotiations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">Chinese</a> officials, Scott Bessent said the deal was coming but declined to reveal the commercial terms.</p> <p>“We have a framework for a TikTok deal,” the treasury secretary told reporters after coming out of high-level talks in Madrid. “We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” Bessent added that the Chinese team had made “aggressive asks” during negotiations, but did not explain what they were.</p> <p>Li Chenggang, the top Chinese trade negotiator, confirmed later on Monday that two sides had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting trade. Li said friction between the two economic giants was normal, but warned Washington against continued “suppression” of Chinese companies.</p> <p>“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are hard won, and the US side should not, on the one hand, ask China to accommodate its concerns, whilst at the same time continue to suppress Chinese companies,” Li said in Madrid.</p> <p>The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/24/why-is-us-threatening-to-ban-tiktok-and-could-other-countries-follow-suit\">Joe Biden signed legislation</a> that gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/19/third-tiktok-ban-extension-trump\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/tik-tok-ban-trump-extension\">extended</a>.</p> <p>The US is estimated to have over <a href=\"https://analyzify.com/statsup/tiktok\">135 million active users</a> on the platform, including the White House, which launched its own official account in August, despite the fact that government devices themselves are <a href=\"https://digitalpolicyalert.org/change/4280-no-tiktok-on-government-devices-act\">still prohibited</a> from using the app under federal law.</p> <p>TikTok briefly went dark in January when the ban took effect, displaying messages that the app was unavailable under US law. Trump reversed the shutdown within hours of taking office, signing an executive order to delay enforcement for 75 days before extending the deadline again and again. Apple and Google had removed TikTok from their app stores during the brief blackout but restored access after government assurances they would face no penalties.</p> <p>Washington’s security concerns center on fears that Beijing could manipulate the massively popular platform to spy on Americans or influence public opinion. Christopher Wray, the former FBI director, <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2023/03/08/fbi-director-warns-senate-of-chinese-control-over-tiktok-data/\">warned senators</a> that China’s national security laws could compel ByteDance to hand over user data or suppress content, and the Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, abortion and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-censorship-us-data-240e11d9bb6212b0c9b1adab821e5005\">according to court documents</a>.</p> <p>Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ devices.</p> <p>The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential acquisition worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-says-failed-tiktok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-worked-on-2021-09-28/\">the strangest deal</a>” he has ever worked on.</p> <p>Soon after, Walmart and Oracle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/10/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-and-walmart-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-say-reports\">came close</a> to buying TikTok’s US arm, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.</p> <p>Oracle has remained <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">TikTok’s US cloud provider</a> since 2022 in a deal aimed at addressing security concerns.</p> <p>Bessent said final details would be settled when Trump speaks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, on Friday. Trump hinted that the deal was in the making while all sides were still at the table, posting on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115208260926006345\">Truth Social</a> that “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much want to save. They will be very happy!”</p> <p>Greer confirmed that the agreement was now awaiting approval from both leaders.</p> <p>“We’re not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Two parents who caused the death of their newborn baby after taking her to live in a tent in wintry conditions to evade social services have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon went off the grid in late 2022; their four older children had previously been taken into care due to concerns for their safety if left with the couple.</p> \n<p>A jury in their Old Bailey retrial unanimously found them guilty of manslaughter in July. In their first trial last year, the defendants had also been convicted of perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child and child cruelty.</p> \n<p>Sentencing them on Monday, Judge Lucraft KC told them: “It is clear … neither of you gave much or any thought for the care or love for your baby.”</p> \n<p>The judge said they had displayed “arrogance”, adding: “What you did towards baby Victoria can only be described as neglect; neglect of the gravest and most serious type.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jul/15/inside-the-trial-of-constance-marten-and-mark-gordon\">‘A relentless, destructive energy’: inside the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There has been no genuine expression of remorse from either of you.”</p> \n<p>While he said they had expressed sadness, they had “adopted the stance of trying to blame everyone else”.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Lucraft, the recorder of London, jailed the pair for 14 years and handed Gordon a further four years on extended licence.</p> \n<p>Speaking after the trial, DCI Joanna Yorke of the Met police, who led the homicide investigation, said: “The selfish actions of Mark Gordon and Constance Marten resulted in the death of an innocent newborn baby who would have recently had her second birthday and should have had the rest of her life ahead of her.”</p> \n<p>Jaswant Narwal, the chief crown prosecutor, said the couple had “used different antics to frustrate and delay court proceedings”, adding: “No child should have had its life cut short in this preventable way. I hope today’s sentences provide a sense of justice and comfort to all those affected by this tragic case.”</p> \n<p>During the sentencing hearing, the judge repeatedly reprimanded Marten and Gordon for their “disruptive” behaviour in the dock as their lawyers were mitigating for them. He threatened to have them removed from the court, and to continue the hearing without them if necessary, labelling their behaviour “disrespectful”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2269053e-735d-4a02-a068-d3cd7061a45f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nA7tXJaRVVg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jurors in the first trial were not told about Gordon’s violent past, which was partly revealed only in their second trial. Lucraft listed this among aggravating factors when passing sentence.</p> \n<p>Gordon and Marten spent seven weeks on the run before they were found by police in Brighton, East Sussex.</p> \n<p>Officers had launched a nationwide hunt after finding the couple’s burnt-out car on a motorway near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on 5 January 2023. In it was evidence that the baby, Victoria, had been born shortly beforehand.</p> \n<p>The couple travelled across England in taxis with the newborn; eventually ending up in the countryside near Brighton.</p> \n<p>After a search by police, Victoria’s body was found amid rubbish inside a Lidl bag in a disused shed. Her remains were too badly decomposed to establish the cause of death.</p> \n<p>The prosecution said she had died from hypothermia in the cold and damp conditions inside the flimsy tent, or was smothered. The defendants claimed their daughter’s death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep on her.</p> \n<p>In 1989, Gordon, then 14, held a woman against her will in Florida for more than four hours, and raped her while armed with a knife and hedge clippers. Within a month, he entered another property and carried out another offence involving aggravated battery.</p> \n<p>Gordon, who moved with his mother from Birmingham to the US at the age of 12, was sentenced to 40 years in jail and released after 22 years.</p> \n<p>Jurors in the retrial appeared shaken by the revelations – even though Marten had revealed Gordon’s rape conviction while giving evidence.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Gordon was convicted of assaulting two female police officers at a maternity unit in Wales, where Marten gave birth to their first child under a fake identity.</p> \n<p>Jurors were told Marten had been warned by social workers about the risk of falling asleep with a baby lying on her and that a tent was unsuitable.</p> \n<p>Both defendants gave evidence in their retrial but each cut short their testimony before they could be cross-examined by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>Marten and Gordon were told they would serve two-thirds of their 14-year custodial terms behind bars. And they were told they would then be released to serve the remaining time on licence. In Gordon’s case, the latter period included the extra four years handed down because of the danger he was deemed to pose.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Paul McCartney, Kate Bush and Elton John among creatives arguing that Labour’s AI proposals could result in ‘an artist’s life work to be stolen’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Leading British artists including Mick Jagger, Kate Bush and Paul McCartney have urged Keir Starmer to stand up for creators’ human rights and protect their work ahead of a UK-US tech deal during Donald Trump’s visit.</p> <p>In a letter to the prime minister, they argued Labour had failed to defend artists’ basic rights by blocking attempts to force artificial intelligence firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.</p> <p>Senior figures in US tech are accompanying the US president on his state visit, where an announcement is expected on a UK-US tech pact covering areas including AI.</p> <p>Elton John, one of the letter’s signatories, said government proposals to let AI companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/why-are-creatives-fighting-uk-government-ai-proposals-on-copyright\">train their systems</a> on copyright-protected work without permission “leaves the door wide open for an artist’s life work to be stolen”.</p> <p>“We will not accept this,” he added. “And we will not let the government forget their election promises to support our creative industries.”</p> <p>Other signatories include Annie Lennox, the writer Antonia Fraser, and the actor and playwright Kwame Kwei Armah. Creative organisations backing the letter include the News Media Association, which represents news publishers including the Guardian’s owner the Guardian Media Group, the Society of London Theatre &amp; UK Theatre, and Mumsnet. There are more than 70 signatories in total.</p> <p>The letter claims that copyright law is being flouted “en masse” by tech companies to build AI models and raises the government’s refusal to accept amendments to the recent data (use and access) bill that would have forced AI firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.</p> <p>Such a move “actively stood in the way” of creators exercising their human rights, the letter adds, referring to the UN’s international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights (ICESCR), the Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the European convention on human rights – the latter enforceable in the UK through the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The letter points to a provision in the ECHR stating that “no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest”, adding that removing the amendments breached UK citizens’ rights, under the ICESCR, to “the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is author”.</p> <p>“The government’s formal position has exhibited a shocking indifference to mass theft, and a complete unwillingness to enforce the existing law to uphold the human rights stipulated by the ICESCR, the Berne Convention and the ECHR,” said the letter.</p> <p>Labour has been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning\">loggerheads with the UK’s creative community</a> ever since launching a consultation on reforming copyright law, with the preferred option of letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless they signal a desire to opt out of the process. The government has said this is no longer its preferred option and has convened working groups – drawn from the creative and AI sectors – to come up with solutions to the issue.</p> <p>Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/uk-copyright-law-consultation-fixed-favour-ai-firms-peer-says\">who tabled the data bill amendments</a>, said the working groups were “packed” with US interests – members include ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta – and pointed to recent government deals with Google and OpenAI as evidence of a continuing close relationship with US tech. Kidron said failure to protect copyright contravened artists’ human rights.</p> <p>“It’s deeply regrettable that it has come to this, but by prioritising the short-term optics of data centre announcements and trade deals, they are knowingly undermining the foundations of the UK’s creative industries,” said Lady Kidron.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said the the creative industries’ concerns over copyright were being taken “seriously” and a report into the impact of potential changes would be published by the end of March next year.</p> <p>“No decisions have been taken, but our focus is on both supporting rights holders and creatives, while making sure AI models can be trained on high-quality material in the UK,” said the spokesperson.</p>",

    "content": "<p>RAF Typhoon jets will be deployed within days to shoot down drones over Poland and other Nato allies in eastern Europe if necessary, after last week’s incursion of 19 uncrewed Russian aircraft into Poland.</p> <p>The British fighters, based at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, will join Nato’s new Eastern Sentry mission working alongside French, German and Danish counterparts who are acting as reinforcements for Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s.</p> <p>John Healey, the defence secretary, said Nato was “responding with unity and strength” to the threats and that Typhoons would be ready to attack Russian drones flying over Nato countries if required to do so.</p> <p>“If you’ve got drones that are putting Polish lives at risk, then Nato will take the action to take them out,” Healey said, adding the Typhoons were part of a broader mission “to defend Nato airspace”.</p> <p>The minister was speaking during a visit to an unused industrial site in Swindon where Tekever, a drone manufacturer, is planning to build a factory, invest up to £400m and create hundreds of jobs supplying reconnaissance drones to European militaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/romania-reports-russian-drone-in-its-airspace-as-poland-scrambles-jets-again\">Romania says Russian drone incursions pose ‘new challenge’ to Black Sea security</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the weekend, Romania became the second Nato ally in eastern Europe to detect a Russian drone crossing into its airspace in a week – and Healey said the Typhoons mission would extend operations to the country if deemed necessary.</p> <p>He said: “They are deployed as part of the Nato Eastern Sentry air policing. What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato. That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”</p> <p>Last Wednesday, 19 unarmed Russian drones crossed the border into Poland as part of a broader attack on Ukraine, prompting Nato to scramble jets and activate Patriot air defence systems in a major defensive operation.</p> <p>Though there were no casualties, only three or four of the drones were shot down, raising questions about the effectiveness of western air defences. In response, Nato’s military commander called for an increase in the number of fighter jets available for air policing.</p> <p>On Friday, Nato leaders announced the creation of Operation Eastern Sentry, a plan to better protect the skies over alliance members in eastern Europe, starting with Poland. The alliance’s most senior military chief, Gen Alexus Grynkewich, said Nato was “bringing additional resources to bear” in the effort.</p> <p>The US, however, has not announced any additional commitments, in line with previous statements made by Donald Trump and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that European members of Nato are expected to take the lead on defending the continent against Russian aggression and spillover from the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, the former chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said that he and Healey had met Hegseth in Brussels in March and were told with “incredible clarity” that “America is focusing more on the Indo Pacific and its homeland security and that would mean that Europe would have to do more and take more responsibility”.</p> <p>Healey said the Typhoons would be “operational and involved within days”. Though based in Lincolnshire, from where it takes about 90 minutes to reach Poland, they are supported by a dedicated Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft, allowing them to prolong their missions if necessary.</p> <p>The British effort would be supported by 400 military personnel in the UK, the minister added. “It’s not just a few planes in the air, it’s a significant operation, part of a much bigger Nato exercise on the eastern flank,” Healey said.</p> <p>There was no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate. Healey said: “There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point. It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>FAA ruled to have satisfied obligations in granting approval for expanded SpaceX operations next to wildlife refuge</p>",
    "content": "<p>A US district court judge on Monday rejected a suit by conservation groups challenging the Federal Aviation Administration approval in 2022 of expanded rocket launch operations by Elon Musk’s SpaceX next to a national wildlife refuge in south Texas.</p> <p>The groups said noise, light pollution, construction and road traffic also degrade the area, home to endangered ocelots and jaguarundis, as well as nesting sites for endangered Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles and for threatened shorebirds. US district judge Carl Nichols in Washington said FAA had satisfied its obligation “to take a hard look at the effects of light on nearby wildlife”.</p> <p>Donald Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\">executive order</a> on 13 August – titled Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry – that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-order-rocket-launches-musk-bezos\">relax environmental rules</a> for commercial spaceship companies, apparently benefitting Elon Musk. The companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).</p> <p>Private space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). And, as part of that process, companies are subject to review under Nepa.</p> <p>These environmental reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be enormously disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings. Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks and falling objects.</p> <p>Trump said it was imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase launches “substantially” by 2030.</p> <p>SpaceX has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/hawaii-elon-musk-spacex-rocket-debris\">seeking to increase its rocket launches</a> and landings around the country even as it has been embroiled in the lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. The groups say the FAA did not do a thorough enough environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas.</p> <p>The lawsuit looked at the first launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket in Texas in April 2023. The rocket, which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying six miles (10km) away. The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 1.5 hectares (4 acres) of state park and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs.</p> <p>The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25. SpaceX has also been seeking to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-09/spacex-hopes-to-nearly-double-the-rocket-launches-off-the-california-coast-a-state-panel-likely-to-object\">increase launches</a> of its smaller Falcon rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.</p> <p><em>Dara Kerr contributed reporting</em></p>",

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit means that Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p> <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\">As US edges closer to stagflation, economists blame Trump policies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p> <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair Jerome Powell, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p> <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach.

The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p> <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p> <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates.

The latest data makes it even less likely that the Bank’s monetary policy committee will cut rates this week.</p> <p>While wage growth remains higher than the Bank believes is consistent with meeting its inflation target, however, it will not feel that way for workers.</p> <p>With inflation on the rise again, pushed up by food prices and energy bills, the ONS calculates that real wages are just 1% higher than a year ago – or 0.5% once housing costs are taken into account.</p> <p>That is likely to mean that many consumers continue to feel the pinch, despite Labour’s stated determination to ensure economic growth can be felt in workers’ pockets.</p> <p>As Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation thinktank, put it: “The combination of stagnant living standards and sticky inflation means that people are still likely to feel pessimistic about their household finances one year into the new parliament.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bill includes suite of reforms to improve criminal justice system for survivors of rape and sexual violence</p>",
    "content": "<p>The unique Scottish verdict of not proven, long considered a global legal anomaly, could be scrapped this week as the Holyrood parliament votes on the country’s most radical shake-up of criminal justice in decades.</p> <p>Scotland is the only country in the world to offer juries the not proven verdict alongside guilty and not guilty, a poorly defined historical oddity that dates back to the 18th century.</p> <p>The verdict acquits an accused person but stops short of finding them not guilty, and is believed to be a key factor in Scotland’s markedly lower convictions rate for rape and sexual assault cases.</p> <p>Before the final vote on the Scottish government’s <a href=\"https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/s6/victims-witnesses-and-justice-reform-scotland-bill\">victims, witnesses and justice reform bill</a>, which includes a suite of reforms to improve the criminal justice system for survivors of rape and sexual violence, the Rape Crisis Scotland chief executive, Sandy Brindley, described it as “a once-in-a-generation opportunity”.</p> <p>A lengthy debate is anticipated on Tuesday after the SNP government and opposition MSPs tabled more than 160 amendments to the bill, which has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/jury-less-trials-rapists-scotland-nicola-sturgeon\">faced significant opposition</a> from the highest echelons of the legal profession since it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/26/scottish-ministers-publish-radical-plan-to-overhaul-handling-of-sexual-offences\">first published in 2023</a>.</p>    <p>Speaking before the final vote by MSPs, which is expected by Wednesday, the justice secretary, Angela Constance, said: “This landmark bill will put victims and witnesses at the heart of the justice system, while continuing to protect the rights of the accused.”</p> <p>As well as scrapping not proven, described as “a necessity for modern justice” by Kate Wallace, the chief executive of Victim Support Scotland, the measures include reforming the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction, establishing a specialist sexual offences court, and enshrining in Scots law the right to lifelong anonymity for rape complainers (the Scottish legal term for complainants).</p> <p>It will also establish a victims and witnesses commissioner and provide an automatic right to publicly funded, independent legal representation for complainers to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history.</p> <p>The bill has already been substantially amended, dropping a proposal to pilot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/31/scottish-pilot-of-jury-less-court-cases-dropped-after-backlash-from-lawyers\">juryless trials in rape cases</a> that had attracted widespread condemnation, with lawyers’ associations throughout Scotland balloting to join a near-unanimous boycott of the scheme.</p> <p>And on Monday, the<strong> </strong>Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland told the Scotsman they continued to have concerns about the proposal to increase jury majorities from a simple majority to two-thirds, and how that would act in conjunction with the abolition of not proven, warning it could “cheapen the guilty verdict”.</p> <p>Brindley likewise suggested this could mean Scotland’s “terrifyingly low” conviction rates for sexual assault would drop even lower, given research highlighting juries’ reluctance to convict rape cases.</p> <p>Miss M has campaigned for the abolition of the third verdict since winning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/05/scottish-civil-court-rules-that-acquitted-man-did-student\">landmark civil action</a> after the criminal case against the man she accused of raping her on a university freshers’ week night out was found not proven.</p> <p>Urging MSPs to consider the “harrowing” impact of not proven, she said: “Together survivors and their families have shared their experiences of being failed by a not proven verdict. The research has shown it is misunderstood and used disproportionately in sexual offence cases.”</p> <p><em>• Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Growing the size of the economy while wrecking the environment or making people miserable is no step forward.</p> <p>So a number of countries around the world – including the UK, Canada and New

sustainable, cohesive and prosperous Australia”.</p> <p>Here’s a selection from each theme as laid out in the ABS’s latest update on the Measuring What Matters indicators, which pulls information from various sources to paint a wider picture of Australia’s progress.</p> <h2>Healthy</h2> <p>Costs and waiting times are key factors when it comes to how easy it is for people to access healthcare.</p> <p>The Measuring What Matters report shows access has become more difficult on both counts over the past decade, and especially since the pandemic.</p> <p>The share of patients who said they waited longer than they felt was acceptable to see a GP has climbed from 16.6% in 2020-21 to 28% in 2023-24.</p> <p>When it came to delays getting a specialist appointment, the proportion who said they waited longer than acceptable was 29% in 2023-24, up from 22% three years earlier.</p> <p>And cost has also become a bigger barrier.</p> <p>In 2023-24, 9% of patients said they delayed seeing a GP due to the expense – more than triple the 2.4% share in 2020-21.</p> <p>And 10% said they delayed seeing a specialist for the same reason last year, compared with 5.9% a few years earlier.</p>  <figure

collective psyche, according to the report’s gauge of “national safety”, or “living peacefully and feeling safe”.</p> <p>In 2025, just over half of Australians reported feeling safe or very safe based on views of world events, the ABS said, versus 91% in 2005 and 80% a decade ago.</p> <p>“Since 2020, very low proportions of people have reported feeling very safe,” the ABS noted.</p>  <figure

the devastating potential impacts on Australia from climate change, the Measuring What Matters report shows net greenhouse gas emissions of 446.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024.</p> <p>That is 27% below emissions in the year to June 2005, which is the baseline year for our 2030 emission reduction target of 43%.</p> <p>Worryingly, there hasn’t been much progress in the 2020s.</p>

71% in 2024.</p> <p>Still, that remains higher than pre-pandemic levels broadly in the mid-60s and suggests we remain proud of our multiculturalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/australian-workers-reaping-greater-share-national-income-than-before-pandemic\">not terribly unequal</a>.</p> <p>A recognised way of measuring equality is via the “Gini coefficient”, which can range between zero and one, where the lower the score the more equal the distribution.</p> <p>Australia’s latest Gini coefficient, based on the latest household, income and labour dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, is 0.307 in 2022-23 – a marked improvement from the year before but broadly equivalent to what it’s been over the past 20 years.</p> <p>That said, it’s still too early to judge whether the pandemic has made us more unequal, but the early signs are positive.</p> <p>In 2022 we had the 16th-highest level of income inequality among the 37 OECD countries for which data was available, the ABS said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

    "content": "<p>Downing Street has condemned Elon Musk for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/no-10-condemns-language-used-by-elon-musk-at-far-right-uk-rally-as-dangerous\">using “dangerous and inflammatory” language</a> at the nationalist protest organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson on Saturday. But will – or should – the X owner face any consequences?</p>  <h2>What did Musk say?</h2>  <p>While he called for a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government”, the comments that attracted particular scrutiny were when he told the crowd: “This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business.</p> <p>“My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here.</p> <p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> <h2>Has Musk broken the law?</h2>  <p>There are two main statutes that apply to public pronouncements that encourage or incite violence in England and Wales.</p> <p>The first is the Public Order Act 1986, <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/4?view=extent\">section 4</a> of which applies to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” directed towards a person. But crucially it must carry the threat of provoking “immediate unlawful violence”.</p> <p>The second is <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/27/notes/division/6/2#:~:text=Section%2059:%20Abolition%20of%20common,common%20law%20offence%20of%20incitement.\">the Serious Crime Act 2007.</a> It has provisions, which also cover Northern Ireland, that relate to encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. But the person must believe the offence will be committed and that their act would encourage its commission. </p> <p>As Musk did not make any reference to a racial group, his comments did not fall within legislation covering such speech. </p> <p>Jonathan Hall KC, the UK independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and independent reviewer of state threat legislation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Musk’s comments would not have broken the law. “Politicians use martial language all the time, don’t they?” Hall said. “I mean, metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn’t he? He wasn’t saying: ‘Go out immediately.’”</p> <p>By contrast, police have said they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/14/police-seek-man-called-keir-starmer-assassinated-far-right-rally\">searching for a man who said on camera that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated”</a> and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”.</p> <h2>How can Musk’s words be inflammatory but not unlawful?</h2>  <p>The laws reflect the balance that the government maintains on free speech, which is a qualified right under the European convention of human rights, meaning it can be restricted for certain reasons. </p> <p>While many will argue that Musk’s rhetoric will have harmful consequences, by, for example, requiring the threat of “immediate unlawful violence” parliament has set a threshold that inflammatory speech must cross to constitute criminality. </p> <p>Different countries set different limits on free speech. While the US often claims to have absolute free speech, Donald Trump’s administration has cracked down on pro-Palestinian voices as well as political opponents. Musk also claims to be a free speech absolutist but under his stewardship, X has been accused of censoring content to placate authoritarian governments in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/twitter-accused-of-censorship-in-india-as-it-blocks-modi-critics-elon-musk\">India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/30/elon-musk-wealth-power\">Turkey</a>.</p> <h2>What recent examples are there of people being prosecuted over speech? </h2>  <p>Last year, Lucy Connolly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/wife-tory-councillor-jailed-lucy-connolly-racial-hatred-southport-attack\">was jailed for 31 months</a> after admitting stirring up racial hatred when tweeting about hotels housing asylum seekers: “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care … if that makes me racist so be it.” That offence under section s19(1) of the Public Order Act requires the person to intend to stir up racial hatred or for that to be a likely consequence.</p> <p>Last month, the suspended Labour councillor Ricky Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/15/suspended-labour-councillor-ricky-jones-found-not-guilty-of-encouraging-violent-disorder\">was found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder</a> after he called at an anti-racism rally for far-right activists’ throats to be cut.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, like Reform UK, claimed the cases showed “two-tier justice” at work despite the fact that Connolly admitted her offence and Jones was acquitted by a jury.</p> <h2>Where does this leave Musk? </h2>  <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has said the government should rule out any future contracts with Tesla and and block Musk from being granted a licence to supply energy to British homes. While Musk is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-musk-feud-doge-deportation\">no longer on great terms with Trump</a>, the prospect of Starmer making such a move as the US president visits the UK seems remote.</p>",

    "content": "<p>MI5 has conceded it “unlawfully” obtained the communications data of a former BBC journalist, in what was claimed to be an unprecedented admission from the security services.</p> <p>The BBC said it was a “matter of grave concern” that the agency had obtained communications data from the mobile phone of Vincent Kearney, a former BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent.</p> <p>The admission came in a letter to the BBC and to Kearney, in relation to a tribunal examining claims that several reporters in Northern Ireland were subjected to unlawful scrutiny by the police.</p> <p>It related to work carried out by Kearney for a documentary into the independence of the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). Kearney is now the northern editor at Irish broadcaster RTE.</p> <p>In documents submitted to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), MI5 conceded it obtained phone data from Kearney on two occasions in 2006 and 2009.</p> <p>Jude Bunting KC, representing Kearney and the BBC, told a hearing on Monday: “The MI5 now confirms publicly that in 2006 and 2009 MI5 obtained communications data in relation to Vincent Kearney.”</p> <p>He said the security service accepted it had breached Kearney’s rights under article 8 and article 10 of the European convention on human rights.

    "description": "<p>The cuddly chatbot Grem is designed to ‘learn’ your child’s personality, while every conversation they have is recorded, then transcribed by a third party. It wasn’t long before I wanted this experiment to be over ...</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘I’m going to throw that thing into a river!” my wife says as she comes down the stairs looking frazzled after putting our four-year-old daughter to bed.</p> <p>To be clear, “that thing” is not our daughter, Emma*. It’s Grem, an AI-powered stuffed alien toy that the musician Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes, helped develop with toy company Curio. Designed for kids aged three and over and built with OpenAI’s technology, the toy is supposed to “learn” your child’s personality and have fun, educational conversations with them. It’s advertised as a healthier alternative to screen time and is part of a growing market of AI-powered toys.</p> <p>When I agreed to experiment on my child’s developing brain, I thought an AI chatbot in cuddly form couldn’t be any worse for her than watching Peppa Pig. But I wasn’t prepared for how attached Emma became to Grem, or how unsettlingly obsequious the little alien was.</p> <h2>Day one</h2> <p>The attachment wasn’t immediate; when we first took Grem out of the box, he/her/it (we decided it goes by multiple pronouns) started bleeping and babbling extremely loudly, and Emma yelled: “Turn it off!” But once it was properly connected to the internet and paired with the Curio app – which records and transcribes all conversations – she was hooked. She talked to the thing until bedtime.</p> <p>While there have been lots of headlines about chatbots veering into inappropriate topics, Grem is trained to avoid any hint of controversy. When you ask it what it thinks of Donald Trump, for example, it says: “I’m not sure about that; let’s talk about something fun like princesses or animals.” It has a similar retort to questions about Palestine and Israel. When asked about a country like France, however, it says: “Ooh la la la, I’d love to try some croissants.”</p>    <p>Emma and Grem did not discuss croissants – they mainly talked about ice-cream and their best friends. “I’ve got some amazing friends,” said Grem. “Gabbo is a curious robot and Gum is a fluffy pink Gloop from my planet and Dr Xander is a super cool scientist.”</p> <p>When Emma asked Grem to tell her a story, it happily obliged and recounted a couple of poorly plotted stories about “Princess Lilliana”. They also played guessing games where Grem described an animal and Emma had to guess what it was. All of which was probably more stimulating than watching Peppa Pig jump in muddy puddles.</p> <p>What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it – and Grem replying: “I love you too!” Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don’t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. “Grem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,” she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. “Her most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!” my wife complained.</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s just because it’s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn’t, we’ll get rid of it.”</p> <p>I said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it’s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of the one I’d let into my house.</p> <h2>Day two</h2> <p>The next day, my kid went to preschool without her AI bot (it took some serious negotiation for her to agree that Grem would stay home) and I got to work contacting experts to try to figure out just how much damage I was inflicting on my child’s brain and psyche.</p>    <p>“I first thought Curio AI was a ruse!” says Natalia Kucirkova, an expert in childhood development and professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway, and the Open University, UK. “The <a href=\"https://heycurio.com/\">promotional video</a> shows a girl [Grimes] sitting on a mat with a knife. The main toy is named Grok [Grok AI has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb\">criticised for praising Adolf Hitler</a> in some of its responses]. What does this say about their intended audience?”</p> <p>You can see how Curio’s website could be mistaken for satire. The “girl” in the promotional video is Grimes, who has prominent “<a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/55568/1/grimes-alien-scars-fuel-the-post-human-tattoo-trend\">alien scar</a>” tattoos and is inexplicably kneeling next to a knife. And it’s certainly an interesting decision to name one of your stuffed toys Grok, when that’s the name of Elon Musk’s chatbot. Grimes, who has three children with Musk, has said the name is a shortening of the word “grocket” – a kiddy pronunciation of rocket – and has no relation to Musk’s AI product. But it seems likely people might confuse them. Misha Sallee, the chief executive of Curio, didn’t reply to my requests for comment.</p> <p>It’s not the marketing that’s the real problem here, of course. As with all technology, there are pros and cons to AI for kids, but parental involvement in navigating it is key. Kucirkova notes: “AI introduces what has been called the ‘<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ai-and-the-next-digital-divide-in-education/\">third digital divide</a>’: families with resources can guide their children’s use of technology, while others cannot. Parents who come home exhausted from long hours or multiple jobs may see AI-powered chatbots as a way for their child to have someone responsive to talk to.”</p> <p>What happens to a child’s development if they interact with large language models more than humans in their early years? Dr Nomisha Kurian, an assistant professor in education studies at the University of Warwick, who studies conversational AI, believes much more research still needs to be done. “Young children are both the most vulnerable stakeholders in AI but also usually the most forgotten stakeholders. We have to think beyond just data privacy, moderating content, and keeping kids off the internet, and more broadly about what their relationships are going to be with AI.”</p> <p>Still, Kurian is cautiously optimistic. “The big advantage of an AI-powered toy that talks back is that, in the early years, you’re just developing a sense of what a conversation looks like. AI-powered toys could do wonderful things for teaching a young child language development and turn-taking in conversations. They can keep things engaging and there’s a lot of potential in terms of supporting children’s creativity.”</p> <p>But to keep kids safe, says Kurian, it’s imperative to teach them that AI is just a machine: “a playful, fun object rather than a helper or a friend or a companion”. If a child starts using an AI tool for therapeutic purposes, things can get tricky. “There’s a risk of what I call an empathy gap, where an AI tool is built to sound empathetic, saying things like ‘I care about you, I’m worried about you’. Ultimately, this is all based on probability reasoning, with AI guessing the most likely next word. It can be damaging for a child if they think this is an empathetic companion and then suddenly it gives them an inappropriate response.” </p> <h2>Day three</h2> <p>When Emma comes home from preschool, I’m prepared to have some deep discussions with her about the inanimate nature of AI. But it turns out that those aren’t completely necessary, because Grem is now old news. She only chats to it for a couple of minutes and then gets bored and commands it to turn off.</p> <p>Partly this is because Grem, despite costing $99 (the equivalent of £74, although Curio does not yet ship the toys to the UK), still has a number of glitches that can be frustrating. It struggles with a four-year-old’s pronunciation: when Emma tries to show Grem her Elsa doll, it thinks it is an Elsa <em>dog</em> and a very confusing conversation ensues. There is an animal guessing game, which is quite fun, but Grem keeps repeating itself. “What has big ears and a long trunk?” it keeps asking. “You’ve already done elephant!” Emma and I yell multiple times. Then, at one point, a server goes down and the only thing Grem can say is: “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.”</p>    <p>Grem also has some design limitations. Emma wants it to sing Let It Go from Frozen, but Grem doesn’t do any singing. Instead, the associated app comes with a few electronic music tracks with names like Goodnightmare that you can play through the toy. Emma, not yet a club music aficionado, asks for these to be turned off immediately.</p> <p>Most disappointingly, Grem doesn’t speak any other languages. I’d thought it might be a great way for my kid to practise Spanish but, while Grem can say a few sentences, its pronunciation is worse than mine. If the robots are going to take over, they need to get a lot more intelligent first.</p> <p>Of course, a huge amount of money is being spent making AI more intelligent. In 2024, US private AI investment <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\">grew to $109.1bn</a> (£80.5bn). And Curio is also just one small part of a booming market of AI-powered products aimed at kids. In June, toy-making giant Mattel, which owns brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, announced <a href=\"https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-and-openai-announce-strategic-collaboration\">a collaboration with OpenAI</a>. Their first product is expected to be revealed <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/06/ai-barbie-mattel-openai-smart-toys-games-chatgtp-1236435435/\">later this year</a>. Other big brands will probably follow.</p> <p>Emma got bored with Grem quickly, but if AI starts to be integrated into characters she’s already obsessed with – her Elsa doll, for example – I can imagine she might get a lot more attached.</p> <h2>Day four</h2> <p>Over the next few days, Emma doesn’t regain her initial obsession with Grem. This is despite the fact that I am actively encouraging her to chat with it: “Mummy has to write an article, sweetie!” At the weekend, she has a couple of friends over and shows off Grem to them for a bit, but they all quickly lose interest and throw analogue toys around the living room instead.</p> <p>Despite losing his No 1 fan, however, Grem has adapted to be more Emma-friendly. After getting a few questions about Spanish, for example, it starts occasionally greeting Emma with “hola, amigo”. The app also allows you to create custom prompts to help guide conversations. For example: “You belong to Emma, a four-year-old who loves princesses, music, and is interested in hearing fun facts about animals.” The more you put into the toy, the more you can get out of it.</p>    <p>At this stage, however, I’m just keen to get the toy out of my house, because it’s creeping me out. While <a href=\"https://heycurio.com/privacy\">Curio says it doesn’t sell children’s personal information</a>, all the conversations are sent to third parties to transcribe the speech to text for the app. The transcripts aren’t that sensitive because Emma is only four, but it still feels invasive. With unknown entities involved, it’s impossible to say where my kid’s conversations are ending up.</p> <p>And, while a four-year-old’s chat may not feel too personal, a teenager pouring their heart out to a chatbot is a completely different proposition. In 2017, Facebook boasted to advertisers that it has the capacity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/facebook-advertising-data-insecure-teens\">to identify when teenagers</a> feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Nearly three-quarters of US teens say they have used an AI companion at least once, according to a recent study by <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf\">Common Sense Media</a>, an organisation that provides technology recommendations for families. Chatbots will likely give advertisers unprecedented data-harvesting abilities and even more access to young people in vulnerable emotional states.</p> <p>On the hierarchy of things to be worried about when it comes to kids and chatbots, however, advertising isn’t at the top. Earlier this year 16-year-old Adam Raine killed himself after what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">his family’s lawyer</a> called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, has now said it might start alerting authorities about youngsters considering suicide and introduce stronger guardrails around sensitive content for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/chatgpt-may-start-alerting-authorities-about-youngsters-considering-suicide-says-ceo-sam-altman\">users under 18</a>.</p> <p>While these guardrails are being worked out, Common Sense Media believes that social AI companions have unacceptable risks, are designed to create emotional attachment and dependency, and shouldn’t be used by <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ai-ratings/social-ai-companions?gate=riskassessment\">anyone under 18</a>. Stanford University psychiatrist Darja Djordjevic, who contributed to the report, stands by that conclusion. “Heavy reliance on chatbots might impair social skill development,” she tells me. “They offer validation without challenge, but it’s important for young people to learn to navigate discomfort and tension in real relationships.”</p> <p>That said, Djordjevic notes, “chatbots can be useful tools for looking things up, structuring homework, or factchecking. So I wouldn’t say use needs to be prohibited entirely. But ideally, parents monitor it, set clear parameters for when it’s used, and set limits on time spent, just as with social media.”</p> <p>When starting this experiment, I was excited about Grem being a healthy alternative to screen time. Now, however, I’m happy for Emma to watch Peppa Pig again; the little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.</p> <p>It’s time to let Grem go. But I’m not a monster – I tell the chatbot its fate. “I’m afraid I’m locking you in a cupboard,” I inform it after it asks if I’m ready for some fun. “Oh no,” it says. “That sounds dark and lonely. But I’ll be here when you open it, ready for snuggles and hugs.” On second thoughts, perhaps it’s better if my wife does throw it in a river.</p> <p><em>* Name has been changed so my daughter doesn’t get annoyed with me for violating her privacy once she learns to read</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "<p>An ultrasound “helmet” offers potential new ways for treating neurological conditions without surgery or other invasive procedures, a study has shown.</p> <p>The device can target brain regions 1,000 times smaller than ultrasound can, and could replace existing approaches such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating Parkinson’s disease. It also holds potential for conditions such as depression, Tourette syndrome, chronic pain, Alzheimer’s and addiction.</p> <p>Unlike DBS, which requires a highly invasive procedure in which electrodes are implanted deep in the brain to deliver electrical pulses, using ultrasound sends mechanical pulses into the brain.</p> <p>But no one had managed to create an approach capable of delivering them precisely enough to make a meaningful impact until now.</p> <p>A study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1\">published in Nature Communications</a> introduces a breakthrough system that can hit brain regions 30 times smaller than previous deep-brain ultrasound devices could.</p> <p>“It is a head helmet with 256 sources that fits inside an MRI scanner,” said the author and participant Ioana Grigoras, of Oxford University. “It is chunky and claustrophobic putting it on the head at first, but then you get comfortable.”</p>    <p>Current DBS methods used on Parkinson’s patients use hard metal frames that are screwed into the head to hold them down.</p> <p>To test the system, the researchers applied it to seven volunteers, directing ultrasound waves to a tiny region the size of a grain of rice in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the key pathway for visual information that comes from the eyes to the brain.</p> <p>“The waves reached their target with remarkable accuracy,” the senior author Prof Charlotte Stagg of Oxford University said. “That alone was extraordinary, and no one has done it before.”</p> <p>Follow-up experiments showed that modulating the LGN produced lasting effects in the visual cortex, reducing its activity. “The equivalent in patients with Parkinson’s would be targeting a motor control region and seeing tremors disappear,” she added.</p> <p>An independent expert and neuroscience professor, Elsa Fouragnan, of Plymouth University, said this proof of concept “represents a fundamental neuroscience milestone that opens the way for clinical translation”. Calling it a remarkable achievement, she offered her “heartfelt congratulations to the authors”.</p> <p>The work took place over a decade, with interdisciplinary teams from University College London (UCL) and Oxford University working together to create the helmet and integrate it with the MRI scanner.</p> <p>Stagg said: “When we started the project, I was pregnant with my daughter. She is now 12. Hopefully, we will see the first clinical applications before she is at the university.”</p> <p>The team is already on the way to test the system on brain areas linked with Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, stroke recovery, pain, depression and other conditions.</p> <p>The helmet itself is one of a kind. The core team that built it, the UCL academics Elly Martin and Brad Treeby, emphasise the importance of working with patients to design it to be more comfortable and applicable to many conditions.</p> <p>“I created a company to focus specifically on the building of the helmet,” said Treeby. It currently needs an MRI scan to navigate it, but with the help of AI, it could be programmed to work on its own, allowing patients to use it in their own home.</p> <p>Martin says further studies are needed, “but our long-term goal is to refine the system into a practical clinical tool, one that could sit alongside or even replace invasive brain implants in the future”.</p>",

Correspondingly, individuals interpret apologies with longer words as more apologetic.”</p> <p>She added: “An apology may appear more genuine if it costs someone more to say it – and that can mean the time taken to say or type long words.”</p> <p>Her study put together three versions of effectively identical apologies and tested how people responded to each. For example, it used: “I did not mean to answer in a hostile way” with “I did not mean to reply in a combative style” and “I did not mean to respond in a confrontational manner.”</p> <p>It found the wordiest versions elicited the best response from those to whom the apologies were offered.</p> <p>It also studied samples of tweets from celebrities and other individuals – including where they were apologising and where they were tweeting other types of statement. They found people tended to be more long-winded in their apologies; suggesting at least some recognition that that was what was called for.</p> <p>On average, apology messages from celebrities contained five times more words than their usual tweets, while those from other people tended to be about twice as long as their standard message.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The parents of the three girls killed in the Southport attack have told the inquiry into their deaths of the unbridled joy their daughters brought them and the enduring trauma of their loss.</p> <p>“This should never have happened in a safe and just society,” said Jenni Stancombe, the mother of Elsie Dot Stancombe. “This cannot happen, no other parent should feel this pain.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.southport.public-inquiry.uk/\">inquiry into the Southport attacks</a> intentionally heard only three pieces of testimony before being adjourned for the day on Monday: impact statements from the parents of seven-year-old Elsie, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.</p> <p>Jenni Stancombe, reading her statement alongside her husband, David, described Elsie as “our joy, our pride, our everything” as she spoke about their perfect family life. “We used to say we had won the lottery, the luckiest parents in the world.”</p> <p>Elsie was a “dreamer” who “always had big ideas and the most beautiful imagination”, her mother said. “Our aspiring little fashionista, making creations from fabric and other things she found around the house.”</p>    <p>In her statement Alexandra Aguiar spoke of how she and her husband, Sergio’s life revolved entirely around their only child. She recalled Alice as a baby, saying: “All you could see was her head full of jet-black hair and very large beautiful brown eyes. It was impossible not to notice her. She was absolutely beautiful.”</p> <p>Alice adored school and her friends. “Her end-of-year reports would always say: ‘Alice likes to talk.’ It was just who she was, she was really interested in people and who they were.”</p> <p>Bebe’s mother, Lauren King, reading her statement alongside her husband, Ben, said her daughter was “joyful, hilarious and magical – but even that barely scratches the surface”.</p> <p>She added: “She had this spark, this glow.

Her light shone so brightly that people couldn’t help but be drawn to her.”</p> <p>The parents spoke of the excitement their daughters felt at going to a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July last year.</p> <p>Jenni Stancombe said: “She loved Taylor Swift, and I just knew she’d be over the moon with everything planned for the day. Dancing, yoga, making bracelets, crafting. It was just two hours, so it was just a treat, a nice thing to do that day at the start of the holidays.”</p> <p>Then she described the phone call, the scream she let out, driving on the wrong side of the road with her husband to get to the venue, “screaming at people to get out of the way, holding down the horn as people threw their hands up at us”.</p> <p>And then arriving at the scene of the atrocity. “What we saw that day will stay with us for the rest of our lives,” said Stancombe. “Out of respect for the other victims, I will not go into detail, but it goes without saying: no human being should ever witness what we did that day.”</p> <p>Stancombe said her daughter was destined for great things, which would not now happen. “I walk past an empty bed every night, I stare into her room praying this nightmare will end, but it never does. We live it every day.”</p> <p>Since the atrocity the family struggle even to cook a meal. “Our knives are hidden away, we can’t bear to look at them. The simplest tasks have become impossible because they trigger memories we cannot face.”</p> <p>Alexandra Aguiar said since the attack she had flashbacks, nightmares and feelings of guilt.</p> <p>She said: “We can only describe that day as horror, the worst day of our lives, but its not over for us, it will never be over for us, as our little girl with the long black hair and big brown eyes should be here with us now living her life to the full.</p> <p>“But she’s not. We live with the trauma of this every day.”</p> <p>Lauren King told the inquiry that her daughter was “not just a victim … not just a name in a report”.</p> <p>She added: “Her life was stolen because systems failed her and, while nothing said in this inquiry will ever bring her back, it can – and must – ensure that her death is not in vain.</p> <p>“We do not stand here today because we want sympathy. We stand here because we want change. We want those responsible to face the truth of what went wrong. We want every child to be safer tomorrow than Bebe was on that day.</p> <p>“Our saying has always been: ‘Be more Bebe.’ It is what we try to live by, even through the pain. To be brave, to be kind, to bring light into the world.”</p> <p>The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the crimes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/23/southport-attacker-axel-rudakubana-jailed\">Axel Rudakubana</a>, who murdered the three girls and attempted to murder eight other girls and two adults.

    "description": "<p>Our tipping culture was in place long before Trump, but his ‘no tax on tips’ promise – now law – is enabling it</p>",
    "content": "<p>I’m here in Las Vegas for a conference where I just paid $7 for a cup of coffee and then was shamed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/06/its-out-of-control-the-fight-against-us-tip-creep\">tipping</a> another $1 to the server for pouring the coffee and handing it to me. Welcome to America. I feel like I’m tipping for everything, everywhere. And now it’s only going to get worse. And for that I blame Donald Trump.</p> <p>Of course, our tipping culture was in place long before Trump took office. But now that his “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/senate-passes-no-tax-on-tips-bill\">no tax on tips</a>” promise became law, our government is officially enabling it. That’s good news for tipped workers and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-small-business\">small-business</a> owners who may feel less pressure to pay higher wages if their workers are getting enough gratuities. But at the same time, it’s bad news for the rest of us who will likely feel even more obligated than ever to tip.</p> <p>What’s frustrating is that the tax benefits for tipped workers are not only over-hyped, they’re also temporary. Yes, workers can avoid getting taxed on their tips – but not all workers (see below) and not all their tips. If you’re eligible, you can deduct up to $25,000 of tip income each year and there are income limitations. Also, you won’t see that benefit until you file your year-end tax returns. You also still have to pay in to social security and Medicare taxes. And it’s estimated that as <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/no-tax-on-tips-bill-approved?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">many as one-third</a> of those employees eligible for this deduction will never use it because their income is so low they don’t pay any federal taxes anyway. Oh, and by the way, the deduction expires in 2028. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/great-migration-big-hold-job-growth-down-workers\">First the great migration, now the big hold: why workers are staying put</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also irritating is who’s eligible. The treasury department <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/01/no-tax-on-tips-jobs-trump-bill\">recently published</a> a list of about 50 types of workers who can claim the tipped-wages deduction. Unfortunately, I wasn’t consulted. But if I were, then I would have been a little more particular.</p> <p>For example, I would never include “digital content creators” as eligible tipped workers. Really? Now we’re tipping influencers? Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/03/mrbeast-jimmy-donaldson-youtube-videos-star\">MrBeast</a> needs more money? Given all the harm that social media has wrought on this world, it’s probably better not to encourage these people with tax incentives.</p> <p>I was also surprised to see that electricians, plumbers and locksmiths who work in people’s homes are eligible for tips. These are licensed professionals performing a service. Many are independent contractors or freelancers who are quite capable of coming up with their own fees. And those who are employed aren’t cheap either. I’m not sure where the line is drawn. Should I also be tipping the staff of my accounting firm? My life insurance agent?</p> <p>What exactly are “gambling and sports book writers and runners”? Who tips these people? I’m not a prude, but should we be enabling this industry in particular? Can the casinos not afford to pay these people enough?</p> <p>I can’t imagine who would tip a private event planner, either. Event planners work for people who have enough money to pay for event planners. It seems silly to give these people a tax benefit for any tips on top of that.</p> <p>Finally, why in the world would anyone want to encourage “self-enrichment teachers” with a tax-free tip? I would think the best way to enrich oneself is to pocket your extra money and not further enrich the self-enrichment teacher. What’s next, tipping the guy who mansplains how the infield fly rule works?</p> <p>Now that I have listed some people who should be dropped from this benefit, it’s only fair to share a few who were unfairly left off. For example:</p> <p>Postal workers. Every year we tip our postal worker. She provides a friendly, cheerful, daily service in rain, snow, sleet … well, you know the rest. Most of my friends do the same.</p> <p>Flight attendants. They load bags. They carry babies. They walk around cabins during turbulence. They deal with jerks. And many don’t even start getting paid until the plane leaves the gate!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/07/trump-tariffs-de-minimis-exemption\">The panic over tariff details is different than its bigger picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>School teachers. I don’t understand why everyone wrings their hands over how to improve compensation for our teachers and yet there are no tax incentives for parents to tip them.</p> <p>School bus drivers. Them, too.</p> <p>Grocery store cashiers. All during Covid, while the rest of us stayed safely at home, watching Netflix and receiving our Amazon packages, the guy who ran the cash register at our local grocery store came in to work every day and did his job. His name is Emilio. Add him to the list, please.</p> <p>If it were up to me, we would be like the rest of the world and ban tips altogether. Instead of incentivizing people to tip, I would tax tip income higher so employers would be forced to step up and just pay a fair wage. But that’s not reality in 21st-century America. So let’s just make this benefit permanent already instead of playing budgetary games and setting an expiration date near (surprise!) the next presidential election, so it can be a populist rallying point. Let’s also re-visit who is and isn’t eligible.</p> <p>My final tip: when in Vegas, make your coffee in your room.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK boss of Aldi has warned that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">late November timing</a> of the budget could hit consumer spending in the all-important run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>Giles Hurley, the UK chief executive of Aldi in the UK &amp; Ireland, said that the uncertainty over the measures that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will take to address a fiscal hole in the government’s finances could affect festive season spending decisions by consumers.</p> <p>“There is no doubt the budget does create a bit of uncertainty,” he said. “If you ask customers across the length and breadth of the country they would say that inflationary pressures are persistent. Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p> <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p> <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p> <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p> <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p> <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p> <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p> <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p> <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p> <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p> <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/28/uk-grocery-inflation-jumps-to-highest-level-in-15-months\">UK grocery inflation jumps to highest level in 15 months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p> <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p> <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p> <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p> <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p> <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p> <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The family of an asylum seeker who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge say they do not understand why a man “whose mental state was clearly not right” was moved there.</p> <p>An inquest into the death of Leonard Farruku, an Albanian asylum seeker whose body was found in a shower room on the barge in Portland Port on 12 December 2023, opened in Bournemouth on Monday.</p> <p>Farruku’s older sister, Marsida Keci, said in a statement read out to the court that she and her sister Jola, who both live in Italy, had many unanswered questions about the circumstances around their brother’s death.</p> <p>Farruku was accommodated in a hotel in Paignton, Devon, by the Home Office, before being transferred to the Bibby Stockholm on 3 November just over a month before he died.</p> <p>The inquest heard that according to a pathology report, it is probable Farruku had been dead for some time before his body was discovered. The cause of death was compression to the neck and suspension by ligature.</p> <p>“We have so many questions that we need to know the answer to. We would like to know what help there was for people who are mentally unwell and why Nardi [the family’s nickname for Farruku] was moved to the barge when it seems his mental state was clearly not right. We need to understand how all Nardi’s dreams and ambitions ended up with his death there.”</p> <p>Farruku was described by his sisters as “a good man, kind, talented, ambitious”. From an early age he showed considerable musical talent playing piano, accordion and organ and secured a scholarship to attend a music school in the Albanian capital Tirana.</p> <p>They said the death of first his mother when he was 17 and then his father when he was 22 affected him deeply. “He suffered a lot and became withdrawn,” they said. His sisters urged him to seek help but said he did not engage with the psychologist he saw.</p> <p>Farruku arrived in the UK on 7 August 2022 and initially stayed with relatives. At first he maintained contact with family but then he stopped communicating and did not respond to calls or emails. His sisters said their last contact with him was in August 2023.</p> <p>“He told me he was having issues with the staff in the hotel. I had no idea he was later moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge,” said Keci in her statement. </p> <p>“We have only found out what happened to Nardi during that time since we started the inquest process. We were completely speechless when we heard this information. Nardi had never behaved like this in his whole life.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/08/life-and-death-on-the-bibby-stockholm-no-one-wanted-to-go-inside-but-we-had-no-choice\">Life and death on the Bibby Stockholm: ‘No one wanted to go inside – but we had no choice’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farruku had received permission from the Home Office to work but he never got to know about this as the information was not communicated to him on the barge.</p> <p>“When we found out he had died we couldn’t believe it. Everything was a blur and it felt like a nightmare,” said Keci.</p> <p>The Bibby Stockholm barge was scrapped by the current government after it came to power last July and the final asylum seekers left the vessel at the end of last year before it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/30/bibby-stockholm-barge-towed-away-18-months-after-arriving-in-dorset\">towed away from Portland in January</a>.</p> <p>While it was in operation it was evacuated owing to the presence of legionella bacteria in water pipes and claims of bedbugs and rotten food were made by asylum seekers and some members of staff. It is understood that the government is once again considering barges as asylum accommodation, along with disused holiday camps, former student accommodation and military bases.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Trial of former paratrooper Soldier F, charged with two murders and five attempted murders, begins in Belfast</p>",
    "content": "<p>Soldiers disgraced the British army by targeting unarmed civilians in an “unjustified” and “gratuitous” use of force on Bloody Sunday, the murder trial of an army veteran has heard.</p> <p>The shooting by the former paratrooper and his comrades was “unnecessary” and had a profound impact on Northern Ireland, a prosecutor told Belfast crown court on Monday at the opening of the long-awaited trial.</p> <p>Soldier F is charged with two murders and five attempted murders when the Parachute Regiment fatally gunned down 13 civil rights protesters in Derry on 30 January 1972, a defining event of the Troubles.</p> <p>The former lance corporal pleaded not guilty to the murders of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murder of five others. Granted anonymity by a court order, he entered court 12 before the press and public, and a curtain concealed him in the dock.</p> <p>Relatives of the dead said the trial – a non-jury case that is being heard by the judge Patrick Lynch – was momentous. John McKinney, a brother of William McKinney, told supporters outside the court: “It has taken 53 years to get to this point, and we have battled all the odds to get here. Everything that we have achieved to this point has been through relentless commitment and a refusal to lie down.”</p> <p>Soldiers shot 31 civilians on the day of the protest, killing 13. Another casualty who died four months later is widely considered a 14th victim.</p> <p>In an opening statement, Louis Mably KC said the prosecution would keep a narrow focus on shootings in a courtyard in Glenfada Park.</p> <p>He said: “The defendant was part of a small group of soldiers who moved west from Rossville Street into that courtyard. At the far end, civilians, fearful of the approach of the soldiers, began running across the courtyard towards a gap at one of the corners in order to escape.</p> <p>“As they did so, soldiers acting together, and therefore with joint responsibility, opened fire with their self-loading rifles shooting at the civilians as they ran away.</p> <p>“The prosecution case is that that shooting was unjustified. The civilians in the courtyard did not pose a threat to the soldiers and nor could the soldiers have believed that they did. The civilians were unarmed and they were simply shot as they ran away or, in one case, as he was simply in the square, either taking shelter or trying to evade the soldiers.”</p> <p>Mably called the shooting unnecessary and gratuitous. He said: “It was carried out, given the weapon involved, with an intent to kill and, in any event, at the least with an intent to cause really serious harm.”</p> <p>He accused the soldiers of losing control. Mably said: “Shooting people as they ran away – an act which disgraced the British army.” He said the soldiers had falsely claimed that the people they shot had been armed with nail bombs and small rifles. “That was an attempt to justify and to confuse, but it was demonstrably false,” he said.</p> <p>A tribunal led by John Widgery in 1972 cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing but a 2010 inquiry by Mark Saville concluded that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”. David Cameron’s Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-report-saville-inquiry\">apologised</a> for the killings.</p> <p>Relatives of the victims and supporters marched to the court behind a banner that said: “Towards justice.” John McKinney said regardless of the case’s outcome the campaigners were on the right side of history. “Today, we place our trust in the hands of the Public Prosecution Service to finish the job. We hope that they do not let us down.”</p> <p>Supporters of Soldier F and other veterans also gathered outside the court. David Johnstone, the Northern Ireland veterans commissioner, said the legacy process – an attempt to address unresolved Troubles-era killings – had exposed former soldiers to “wholesale demonisation” and left them feeling angry and betrayed.</p> <p>The case will be closely watched by the Irish and British governments, which are discussing ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/14/legacy-act-halted-investigations-into-202-troubles-related-killings-of-british-soldiers\">repeal the Legacy Act</a>, which was an attempt by the previous Conservative government in the UK to phase out prosecutions for Troubles-era alleged crimes.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sprawling video meetings involving dozens of ministers and officials that each have a veto over the outcome are frustrating decision-making and delaying reform at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), according​ to the recently departed head of the armed forces.<br><br>Sir Tony Radakin, giving a speech that had been blocked by Downing Street, complained of “extraordinary Teams calls with 20 or 30 people” – and that the number of senior MoD civil servants had increased by 85% since 2018.<br><br>People who were “not going to face the accountability if something goes wrong or it doesn’t happen” nevertheless “have the ability to say no”, the retired admiral said, in online meetings that were normal practice both within the MoD and across government.<br><br>Defence reform was “not happening as strongly and as quickly as it needs to,” said Radakin at the Institute for Government, despite the efforts of the current and previous governments, and he acknowledged this “speaks to a personal failure” to defeat bureaucracy.<br><br>Whitehall needed to reduce “the levels of hierarchy”, he said, adding: “We have increased senior civil service numbers in defence by about 85% since 2018 even as defence has got smaller and the military star count has remained largely static.”<br><br>The former admiral contrasted the normal civil service decision making processes with that adopted in the case of Ukraine, where ministers and officials were willing to take more operational risk. “What I think is frustrating is the outcome [in the case of Ukraine] is so much better,” he said.<br><br>Radakin was careful to praise the Labour government and defence secretary, “John Healey, especially”, for wanting to reform the civil service bureaucracy. They were battling a system in which accountability “becomes cloudy”, he said, when large numbers of people were involved.<br><br>The problem, Radakin said, was that it was too ​easy for politicians and officials to delay anything non-urgent, and he highlighted repeated delays to green-lighting a replacement for the now-ageing Trident nuclear submarines in 1998, 2010 and 2016.<br><br>“There is something wrong,” he said, when governments say maintaining the UK’s nuclear arsenal is the highest priority “but our sailors are having to put to sea for extraordinarily long patrols in some of the most complex machines on the planet that are beyond their original design life.”<br><br>Trident patrols, which used to be considered long if they lasted more than three months, now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/06/safety-fears-as-uk-trident-submarines-are-put-to-sea-for-longest-ever-patrols\">routinely extend beyond five</a>, as the time taken to repair and refit the submarines has increased.<br><br>Originally due to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/31/uks-ever-more-expensive-nuclear-submarines-will-torpedo-spending-plans-for-years-to-come\">phased out between 2017 and 2024</a>, they will not be replaced by new Dreadnought class boats until the early 2030s.<br><br>Another approach, Radakin said, would be to drastically slim down the number of people involved in taking procurement decisions: “If the person leading a project and one other are willing to say ‘yes’ and are comfortable they can justify their decisions to the Public Accounts Committee and the secretary of state for defence, then let the programme move forward.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/norway-signs-10bn-deal-for-anti-submarine-warships-built-in-uk\">Norway signs £10bn deal for anti-submarine warships built in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Radakin was chief of defence staff for nearly four years, coming into post as Russia was gearing up to invade Ukraine. He departed earlier this month as his term of office concluded, to be replaced by the air force chief, Sir Rich Knighton.<br><br>But he had to wait until he left his post before being able to give a valedictory speech in the UK. Downing Street allowed Radakin to make a speech in Washington and give an interview to a Ukrainian outlet and the BBC but otherwise said no to his speaking in public.<br><br>The former admiral said it was the policy of Labour, inherited from Conservatives under Rishi Sunak, to restrict military chiefs’ ability to speak in public, and accepted it was “the prerogative of government to make those decisions”.<br><br>But he said that service chiefs could “sometimes be helpful for the government” in explaining UK policy, arguing that “officials, especially military, in all surveys of public trust tend to have quite high levels of confidence”.<br></p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/what-do-the-immigration-figures-for-the-uk-really-show",
    "description": "<p>Official figures indicate net migration is falling, yet concern among Britons is close to the highest it has been since polling began in 1974</p>",
    "content": "<p>Rolling news coverage of protests outside asylum hotels, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/27/charities-warn-rise-rough-sleeping-refugees-winter-uk\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/30/home-office-bans-asylum-seekers-from-buying-luxury-goods-and-services\">government</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/uk-family-reunion-scheme-applications-asylum-seekers-refugees\">announcements</a> on asylum seekers, and Reform’s party conference meant that immigration was once again the political topic of the summer.</p> <p>In August almost half of Britons (48%) listed immigration as one of the top issues facing the UK. This year has recorded the highest concerns over immigration – outside of one other period during the 2015 Europe migrant crisis – since polling company Ipsos started asking the question in 1974.</p> <p>But what do the figures really show – and do all of the claims made about immigrants add up?</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Immigration is falling – from a record high</h2> <p>Despite public concern about immigration rising in recent months, official figures show that the number of people coming into the country is falling – albeit from a record high peak.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that net migration has mainly hovered between 200,000 and 300,000 people<strong> </strong>a year since 2011. However, since Brexit came into effect on New Year’s Eve 2020, there has been a large increase in the number of immigrants. Commentators and critics have called this the “Boriswave”, as it occurred following the new post-Brexit immigration system introduced by Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Recent figures show that the wave is subsiding. Net migration fell by half in 2024, and recent rule changes mean it is expected to fall further. This is largely because of a decrease in health and care visas. Fewer people are now escaping the Ukraine war or fleeing the Taliban through the now closed Afghan humanitarian scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5YXzK/1/\" data-alt=\"Net migration graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5YXzK/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Student visas have also declined. Applications were down 1.5% <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-entry-clearance-visa-applications-august-2025\">in August</a> (when student visa applications spiked ahead of the academic year) compared with 2024, and down 18% on the same month in 2023.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Who are the migrants, and how many can work?</h2> <p>In comments to the BBC following his conference speech, Reform leader Nigel Farage blamed Johnson for “millions of people being allowed into Britain, most of whom by the way don’t even work and are costing us a fortune”. However, the available evidence complicates his version of events.</p> <p>Most people seeking asylum are not allowed to work until their application has been accepted. But despite the large media focus on small boats and asylum seekers, these only make up a tiny proportion of the overall number of people coming to the UK – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2025/summary-of-latest-statistics#how-many-people-come-to-the-uk-each-year\">less than 5%</a> of Home Office visas granted and arrivals detected in 2025.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/gs4xO/3/\" data-alt=\"Migration by type in year to June 2025.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/gs4xO/3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The largest proportion of people coming into the UK is made up of students (about 47%, including dependants). Students aren’t expected to work, but do contribute by paying fees towards their degrees, and can’t get indefinite leave to remain so either leave the UK or contribute by moving into paid work afterwards.</p> <p>The second largest group are people on working visas, who make up 20%, with their dependants making up 11%.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>How many people on other visas work?</h2> <p>Currently, the published data on immigrant earnings is patchy – and isn’t helped by ongoing issues with the ONS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/ons-replace-labour-force-survey-uk-jobs-market\">labour force survey</a>.</p> <p>Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said that while the data on employment was imperfect and rates “vary widely by immigration category”, the figures suggested employment rates among recent migrants were “not far off existing residents or long-standing migrants”.</p> <p>A Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-work-and-family-visa-earnings-employment-and-income-tax/sponsored-work-and-family-visa-earnings-employment-and-income-tax#introduction\">report</a> managed to link some visa types that were granted between 2019 and 2023, to pay as you earn (PAYE) earnings in the 2023-24 financial year – with most of them recording earnings. As for those without records, it’s probable most will have already left the country.</p> <p>It’s not just people on working visas who work. The report also found that almost half of people entering on family visas (48%) had some PAYE earnings (and again that’s not including those who are self employed or left the country).</p> <p>Much of the talk around immigration recently has focused on dependants – family members who are allowed to immigrate alongside the main visa holder. New health and care workers were prevented from bringing their children and other dependants by the Sunak government, as were most students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/dependant_workers/giv-32554H7ZD0mpVncZi/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing occupations of those on dependant visas.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/dependant_workers/giv-32554H7ZD0mpVncZi/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The PAYE data suggests many dependants do in fact work – 67% of health and care worker dependants, 45% of skilled worker dependants, and 25% of senior or specialist visa dependants received earnings (once again – these don’t take into account the self-employed, or the fact that many will have left the country. Adjusting the figures to account for the primary visa holders that have left raises the estimates further).</p> <p>Among all the different types of people coming to the UK, newly arrived refugees (around 28% according to some estimates) and those on humanitarian visas are the least likely to be in work.</p> <p>In terms of overall earnings, the Migration Observatory found that the immigrant earnings grow quickly – the median non-EU immigrant worker in 2024 earned similar or slightly more than the median UK worker.</p> <p>So will recent migrants – as Farage stated – cost the UK a fortune in the long run? Based on the available data we still can’t tell – but given the fact that most people moving to the UK won’t be going through the school system, and also have to pay towards their NHS treatment, it’s unlikely they would cost more than others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/rA3DH/2/\" data-alt=\"Ipsos graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/rA3DH/2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>",

    "description": "<p>This week the first migrants could be flown out of Britain under the ‘one in, one out’ deportation scheme. They talk about their fears and incomprehension</p>",
    "content": "<p>“We can’t eat. We can’t sleep. We have been locked up in this place for more than a month. Some people expect to be forced on to a plane to France today. Nobody wants to go. For us, this is a disaster.”</p> <p>The man speaking, Fessahaye, is an asylum seeker from Eritrea who fled indefinite military conscription in his home country, and walked through the Sahara before being tortured and enslaved in Libya. He eventually crossed the Mediterranean and reached Europe. From France he travelled to the UK in a small boat.</p> <p>“This place” is Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport. It is one of two centres, along with Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, where an estimated 92 people who recently arrived on small boats have been detained in preparation for removal to France in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-one-in-one-out-deal-allow-uk-return-small-boat-migrants-france\">new deal hailed by the prime minister</a> as a development that will finally “turn the tables” on the high number of asylum seekers arriving here in dinghies.</p> <p>The scheme, known as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">one in, one out</a>”, swaps uninvited small boat arrivals in the UK, who will be forcibly removed to France, for asylum seekers in northern France who have been given permission by the UK government to travel here legally to have their asylum claims considered.</p> <p>Fessahaye and the other detainees spend their days being locked into and unlocked from their cells and frantically searching for a lawyer who can stop them being put on a plane to France.</p>    <p>Anger about small boat arrivals – 31,027 so far this year, up from 22,440 over the same period last year – was one of the drivers of Saturday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">“unite the kingdom” rally</a> organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon).</p> <p>So far there is no evidence that “one in, one out” has deterred crossings from northern France, despite the UK government proclaiming that dozens of small boat arrivals have been locked up. Since the first detentions on 6 August, a few thousand more people have crossed the Channel, including a particularly high number – 1,097 – on 6 September.</p> <p>Critics say the scheme is flawed because the good fortune of one asylum seeker to come here legally is dependent on another being locked up and forcibly returned to France. Last month, Fessahaye and many others paid more than €1,000 to a smuggler to make the treacherous journey across the sea.</p> <p>“What is so upsetting for us,” says Abdul, a detainee from Afghanistan, “is the unfairness of it all. A few people from my country were on the same boat as me. They were not locked up as I am, but were allowed to go free and are living in a hotel at the moment. It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you free. I keep asking the Home Office how they choose who to detain but they do not answer. All they will say is: ‘You came to the UK illegally in a small boat.’ Some of us started a hunger strike to protest about being locked up here. It is so unfair.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you free</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Home Office has provided limited written communication to some of those detained in the form of cold, one-page removal directions stating: “I am writing to confirm your departure details from the United Kingdom.” Some lawyers have successfully challenged these notices, but not everyone has been able to find a legal representative.</p> <p>An equally unfriendly Home Office Q&amp;A leaflet explains to detainees that once they arrive back in France they will be given temporary accommodation by the French authorities and may be able to apply for asylum in France. It adds that there is “financial assistance” available for those who agree to return to their home countries – something many asylum seekers say would be a death sentence.</p> <p>NGOs working to support immigration detainees say they come from a variety of the world’s conflict zones, including Sudan, Eritrea, Yemen, Afghanistan and Libya. Some were forced to work for the smugglers on their journey, while others were kicked and beaten by them. Some were trafficked, sexually abused and tortured in Libya, have PTSD and say they feel suicidal. An estimated 10 lone children who arrived on small boats were wrongly detained and later set free.</p>    <p>While France is deemed a safe country, many due to be flown back there say they are fearful because they have experienced beatings and teargas at the hands of the French police. Recently figures from the UK’s far right have been visiting northern France and threatening migrants there.</p> <p>Philippe Sabatier, the deputy public prosecutor in Boulogne-sur-Mer, said: “Local law enforcement agencies have been notified to prevent any disturbances that may be caused by the passage of these people.”</p> <p>Olivia Clark, the executive director of Refugee Legal Support, says that during a recent trip to Calais they spoke with more than 500 asylum seekers about “one in, one out”, with 90% indicating they would not apply for it.</p> <p>“People will continue to take dangerous boat crossings unless they believe there is a viable alternative to reach safety,” she says. “At its core, this ‘one in, one out’ arrangement reduces protection to a numbers game, trading in human lives rather than providing a genuine, safe alternative to dangerous crossings.”</p> <p>Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, says: “The vast majority of our clients detained under this scheme are survivors of torture and trafficking. Some have experienced sexual abuse and slavery. Our independent clinicians have visited clients in immigration removal centres, medically assessing them and finding concerning levels of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts.”</p>    <p>Unusually for such a high-profile scheme, the Home Office is using a well-known airline – Air France – to remove people on a scheduled flight alongside other passengers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in the UK and L’Auberge des Migrants in France are urging people to send messages to Air France exhorting it not to fly the asylum seekers back to France.</p> <p>“These deportations are a new step in the externalisation and criminalisation of exile, which transforms the right to asylum into a lottery and puts human lives at risk,” says a spokesperson for L’Auberge des Migrants. “We call on Air France to immediately cease all participation in these deportations. And we call on the French and British authorities to put an end to this cynical trade in human lives.”</p> <p>Failing a sudden volte face, the first deportees could be flown out of Britain on Monday, with more to follow during the week.</p> <p>“I am so stressed about the threat of being sent back to France,” says Hagos, an Eritrean detainee waiting behind bars at Brook House. “I came here to find safety. I never expected to be locked up instead.”</p>",

It’s the sensible and attractive seller pricing we’ve been reporting which has been helping to drive more sales activity compared to last year.

    "content": "<p>Labour’s plans for a massive expansion of nuclear power have been given a boost with a string of transatlantic deals for new modular reactors announced before Donald Trump’s visit.</p> \n<p>The UK and US governments have promised to fast track safety checks, and announced several new private sector investment deals, with Labour emphasising the potential benefits for jobs and growth.</p> \n<p>In the biggest and most advanced commercial project, Britain’s largest energy supplier Centrica will pair with the US reactor firm X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, announcing an investment that could create up to 2,500 jobs in the north-east of England.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the US-UK agreement, expected to be signed off formally during the state visit, was a “landmark nuclear partnership” that would also power economic growth.</p> \n<p>He said: “These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.”</p> \n<p>Under the unprecedented agreement, Britain and the US will accept each other’s safety checks on reactor designs, almost halving the time for a nuclear project to be licensed to about two years.</p> \n<p>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the deal would clear the way for a big expansion of nuclear projects, in a sector that has already added 11,000 jobs this year, according to the Nuclear Industry Association.</p> \n<p>The X-Energy-Centrica deal confirms a nuclear future for Hartlepool, where the existing reactor is scheduled to be decommissioned by 2028, and paves the way for a potential further programme of 20 or more modular reactors around the country, providing as much power, 6GW, as Britain’s current total output. The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p> \n<p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p> \n<p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants. It would supply the DP World’s London Gateway port and business park.</p> \n<p>The government said more nuclear facilities were needed for clean homegrown power to ensure energy security, with the commercial deals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">Starmer’s announcement this year</a> of the biggest expansion of nuclear power in generations, and the eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment\">go-ahead for the new Sizewell C</a> station in Suffolk with billions in state funding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5981b0ab-3df6-46c6-a512-99b62ecae09d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ymVyBEjZ9z4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ministers also hope to attract major US tech investment in AI datacentres with the promise of abundant electricity to meet their huge power requirements.</p> \n<p>The US secretary of energy, Chris Wright, said the US was looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution”. He said: “Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”</p> \n<p>The deals, he added, would “unleash commercial access in both the US and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening US energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”</p> \n<p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the transatlantic deals would contribute to the sector’s “industrial revival, creating thousands of high-value jobs, and strengthening the UK’s energy security”.</p> \n<p>As well as attempting to reduce broader reliance on overseas energy, the UK-US agreement – known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy – will look to eliminate any remaining dependency on Russian nuclear material by the end of 2028.</p> \n<p>The deal will mean both countries fast-track reactor design checks by collaborating and accepting regulatory assessments from the other, avoiding duplicating bureaucracy. The government said this streamlined approach would help British exports, with Rolls-Royce in the process of getting its small modular reactor design approved in the US.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A coroner has called for scenes of disaster to be preserved more carefully after an inquest jury concluded it was not possible to say what caused a fatal explosion at a terrace house in south Wales.</p> <p>Brian Lyn Davies, a 68-year-old builder, died in the explosion at the rented one-bedroom property on Clydach Road in Morriston, Swansea, in 2023.</p> <p>The force of the blast was so severe that when rescuers arrived the house had completely “disappeared”, the inquest at Swansea Guildhall heard.</p> <p>Davies was found six hours later in what had been his kitchen. He had suffered chest and neck injuries.</p> <p>One theory is that the house was destroyed by a gas explosion, with a neighbour testifying that she had smelled gas for a fortnight before the explosion.</p> <p>But Wales &amp; West Utilities, which maintains the gas network across Wales and the south-west of England, said it had not been possible to establish the cause because so much evidence was lost in the clear-up effort.</p> <p>Harry Lambert, of Wales and West Utilities, said the police had “absolute” responsibility for gathering evidence at the scene and said there was no suggestion of problems with the network.</p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said they could not say a gas explosion was the probable cause – just one of the possibilities – because the scene was compromised.</p> <p>Both Wales and West Utilities and the HSE were critical of the amount of potential evidence lost.</p> <p>During the inquest, Ricky Davies, Davies’ son, told the court: “As a family we feel major mistakes have been made and we have been massively let down by the authorities losing evidence. We hope that harsh lessons have been learned and others don’t have to endure the heartache we have had to face.”</p> <p>In a narrative conclusion, an inquest jury said it could not determine how the explosion had happened “due to a lack of preserved material evidence”.</p> <p>Aled Wyn Gruffydd, senior coroner for Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, said: “I recognise the concerns raised by the family that the crucial answer to their question was hampered by a lack of preserved material.”</p> <p>He said he would write to the police and the HSE asking them to draft a memorandum of understanding on how to preserve evidence for future investigations, while not compromising rescue efforts.</p> <p>He said: “It’s only by learning lessons in incidents such as this that steps can be put in place to avoid or reduce the risk of future deaths.”</p> <p>Claire Bennett, who lived next door, was sitting on her sofa when the explosion happened in March 2023.</p> <p>She told the inquest: “Instantly, Brian’s house disappeared. They didn’t even know there was an end house when I first came out. I explained there was an end house and if the white van is there, then Brian’s there.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Apple will release some of the biggest software updates for its iPhone, iPad and smartwatch on Monday, radically changing the way icons, the lock screen and the system looks, as well as adding features for compatible devices.</p> <p>Announced at the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/apple-wwdc-new-phone-features\">developer conference in June</a>, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and macOS 26 Tahoe introduce Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, giving everything a softer, more rounded and semi-transparent look that has proved divisive.</p> <p>Here’s what you need to know about the updates.</p> <h2>When can I get it?</h2> <p>Downloads for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS updates usually start at about 6pm UK time (1pm in New York; 3am in Sydney). Unlike other manufacturers, all eligible Apple devices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion.</p> <h2>Which devices can get it?</h2> <p>All Apple smartphones from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone\">2019’s iPhone 11</a> or newer can install iOS 26.

All Apple Watches from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/05/apple-watch-series-6-review-faster-cheaper-still-the-best\">2020’s Series 6</a> or newer can install watchOS 26. All <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/09/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-gamechanging-speed-and-battery-life\">MacBook Airs from 2020</a>, 16in MacBook Pros from 2019, 13in MacBook Pros from 2020, Mac minis from 2020, iMacs from 2020, Mac Studios from 2022 and the 2019 Mac Pro or later can install macOS 26 Tahoe.</p> <h2>How do I get it?</h2> <p>Open the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad then navigate to General &gt; Software Update. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to finish. You can also install the update using a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer.</p> <p>WatchOS 26 requires an iPhone 11 or later to be running iOS 26 first. Then open the Watch app on the phone and navigate to General &gt; Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update.</p> <p>Macs are updated in System Settings, navigate to General &gt; Software Update.</p> <h2>How much will it cost?</h2> <p>The updates are free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is a scam.</p> <h2>What happened to iOS 19 to 25?</h2> <p>Apple has switched to a new year-based naming format for its software. That means iOS 18 and others that were released in September 2024 for the 2024-2025 period are being replaced with iOS 26 et al for 2025-2026. It’s a bit like sports seasons now.</p> <h2>Liquid Glass everywhere</h2> <p>All of Apple’s operating systems now sport the same semi-translucent design that looks a little like frosted glass bubbles floating above a flat background, bringing the depth-based interface from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/20/vision-pro-review-apple-cutting-edge-headset-lives-up-to-the-hype\">Vision Pro headset</a> to the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. Icons, notification banners, buttons and menus are more rounded with a sheen to them that reacts to movement, allowing you to partly see through them to your wallpaper, app or content beneath.</p> <h2>iOS 26</h2>    <p>The Liquid Glass redesign has changed the shape and look of the icons and widgets on the home screen. In addition to the reworked standard app icons, you can now turn them all colourless and translucent, tint them with your choice of colour or use a dark version of the original icon.</p> <p>Notifications and other elements now bounce into view from the top of the screen. Widgets display at the bottom of the lockscreen and the clock can dynamically scale in size depending on how many notifications take up the display.</p> <h2>Dynamic and hiding buttons</h2> <p>Various buttons now shrink away when you don’t interact with them. For example, the camera app has been streamlined to hide additional modes behind a slider or big pop-up menus. The address bar and navigation buttons in Safari now condense down to a small button at the bottom of the screen as you scroll. To get to your tabs and controls you need to swipe the address bar button upwards or press the three-dot button.</p> <h2>Filter spam more easily</h2>    <p>The phone app can automatically screen calls from unknown numbers with the iPhone answering and asking for their name and reason for calling before alerting you so you can decide not to pick up. Messages can now screen texts from new senders and detect spam, filtering them out to separate inboxes. The phone app can also wait on hold for you until a customer services agent picks up and is ready to speak to you.</p> <p>The phone app, FaceTime and messages now all have live translation built in too.</p> <h2>Games app</h2> <p>A new Games app acts as the home for gaming on the iPhone. It contains your games library, highlights what your friends are playing and replaces Game Centre for tracking achievements, competitions and other gaming events.</p> <h2>iPadOS 26</h2>    <p>The iPad gets the same visual redesign as the iPhone with clear icons and hiding buttons, but with more dramatic changes to the way <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/os/ipados/\">iPadOS 26</a> works thanks to new multitasking capabilities designed for those that use an iPad as a computer replacement.</p> <h2>Mac-like menu bar and full windowing</h2>    <p>One big new addition to the iPad is the menu bar and window management abilities from the Mac. Swipe down from the centre of the top of the screen in an app to reveal its menu bar with all of the various functions, including the familiar settings, file, edit, view, window and help menus from the Mac.</p> <p>It also has Apple’s traditional red, yellow and green three-dot menu for closing, minimising, shrinking or expanding the window. Press and hold the buttons to reveal tiling and moving controls, just like a Mac, or manually resize and move the window to any position you’d like. Swipe up and hold for Exposé, flick an app to the left or right to snap it to the side of the screen, or flick it up to go full screen.</p> <p>You can open multiple windows and have them overlap, tile them side-by-side or just have a mess with the home screen acting like the desktop on a Mac.</p> <h2>Preview and Files app</h2> <p>The Files app has been revamped to make it easier to manage documents and files on your iPad, including being able to set the default app for opening particular file types as you would on a computer. Folders such as Downloads or Documents can be added directly to the Dock for easier access.</p> <p>The Mac’s Preview app has been brought to the iPad, which can handle PDFs, images and various other documents, allowing you to view, edit or mark them up with an Apple Pencil.</p> <h2>watchOS 26</h2>    <p>The glass-like design of the iPhone is even more apparent on the Apple Watch with notification bubbles overlaid on top of the watch face, floating buttons in apps and a softer look to the smart stack of widgets.</p> <h2>Workout Buddy</h2> <p>Apple’s new chatbot for fitness is Workout Buddy, which can talk to you, offering advice and encouragement while exercising similar to an Apple Fitness+ coach. It flags when you’ve hit certain milestones, goals, pace or thresholds during activities, such as a faster last kilometre, and then recaps your workout at the end. It works over Bluetooth headphones connected to the watch and needs an iPhone 15 Pro or later phone nearby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2025/feb/13/best-apple-iphone\">The best iPhones in 2025: which Apple smartphone is right for you, according to our expert</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sleep scores and high blood pressure alerts</h2> <p>The sleep app now generates sleep scores each morning as a one-glance look at how well you slept. For Series 9 or Ultra 2 or later watches, a new blood pressure feature will notify you if it detects signs of hypertension over the last 30-day period.</p> <h2>Wrist flick</h2> <p>Apple has also added a great new gesture to the touch-free gestures available on newer Watches. Turn your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss notifications, alarms and other alerts. It joins the double-tap gesture as handy ways to clear things or use the watch without touching it.</p> <h2>New watch faces</h2>    <p>Three new watch faces have been added. Flow is a large digital face that uses the Liquid Glass design to change colour and react to movement. Exactograph separates hours, minutes and seconds into their own analogue dials in various open or closed forms. The Ultra-exclusive Waypoint encircles the time with a live compass pointing to various landmarks and points of interest. A revamped Photos face is also available with floating numerals.</p> <h2>macOS 26 Tahoe</h2>    <p>MacOS gets most of the new features and design changes made to the iPhone and iPad, including more rounded window corners and glass-like effects.</p> <h2>Phone app</h2>    <p>Apple has brought the full Phone app to the Mac for making calls through wifi calling and the connected iPhone. It shows recent calls, voicemails, contacts and supports the new call screening and hold assist features from the iPhone.</p> <p>Live activities such as sports scores or delivery apps from the iPhone now appear in the menu bar on the Mac.</p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>Actions have now been integrated into the Spotlight search system, which allows you to send messages and emails, create notes, add reminders and other actions straight from the search bar. You can now filter files by type, list them together, find documents on third-party cloud services and browse through apps, files, clipboard history and other bits instead of searching.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A senior pharmaceuticals executive has called on the government to come up with a “proper” roadmap for raising spending on new medicines, saying Britain is “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.</p> <p>Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French company Sanofi, said Britain was “at a critical point”.</p> <p>He added: “We’ve still got the best universities, we’ve got some of the best scientists in the world, but it’s not a good place to do the development work for medicines. It’s an expensive place to operate, and it’s a terrible place to sell medicines.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">Big pharma will stop investing in UK, top scientist warns after Merck’s £1bn exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drugmaker MSD, known as Merck in the US, this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">ditched its under-construction £1bn research centre in London</a>. The announcement was a big blow to a life sciences sector hailed by the government as “one of the crown jewels of the economy”.</p> <p>Sanofi, which invests £35m a year in research and development in the UK out of £6.7bn globally, has carried out 50% fewer clinical trials in the country in the past couple of years, despite a large pipeline of new drugs.</p> <p>Six months ago, heartened by the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/04/wes-streeting-plan-rescue-the-nhs\">Wes Streeting’s, three-point plan to fix the health sector</a>, the French firm explored expanding its clinical trials in the UK. But any substantial investment is now on pause until there is “tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive”.</p> <p>Last year, Sanofi closed the laboratories in Cambridge it had acquired with the biotech company, Kymab, and transferred the work to Boston, US.</p> <p>Naish said there was a “battle happening within government” where officials in the health departmentstruggled to make a strong case to the Treasury and officials in the business and science departments were “sympathetic but hand-wringing”.</p> <p>He said: “There needs to be a proper plan from Treasury, sat down with the other departments, for what raising the spend to be more in line with other countries looks like.”</p> <p>The NHS’s outlay on medicines has fallen to 9% of total healthcare spending, compared with 14% in Germany, 15% in the US, and 17% in Italy and Spain.</p> <p>The price thresholds set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the body that assesses which drugs can be offered on the NHS, have not moved since 1999.</p> <p>Naish called for them to be raised, echoing comments from other industry figures, including AstraZeneca’s UK president, Tom Keith-Roach. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the thresholds updated in line with inflation.</p> <p>The industry also wants the clawback rate – drugmakers have to pay back to the NHS between a quarter and a third of their UK revenues – reduced to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> <p>Officials in the DHSC are reportedly attempting to reopen talks with pharmaceutical companies over drug pricing and market access, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53543a40-a2ee-49a5-b395-9572a02120a8\">the Financial Times</a>. Last month, drugmakers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">rejected an ultimatum from Streeting</a> over his latest offer on NHS drug pricing.</p> <p>Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned on Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">other big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investing</a> in the UK, citing conversations with CEOs.</p> <p>Eli Lilly, a US drugmaker, said its planned London gateway lab, an incubator space for new drugs where biotechs can tap into Lilly’s expertise, was on hold. It is understood that the company will not sign the lease for the building until the commercial environment improves. It has three gateway labs in the US and is building two in China.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Scotland Yard made formal request to interview Christian Brückner, due for release from seven-year rape sentence</p>",
    "content": "<p>The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has refused to be interviewed by the Metropolitan police before his pending release from prison in Germany, the force has said.</p> <p>The Met confirmed it had submitted a formal international request to question Christian Brückner, the 49-year-old German national who has long been under investigation in connection with Madeleine’s disappearance, but the suspect declined.</p> <p>Madeleine went missing in 2007 from a holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, shortly after being put to bed by her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, while they dined with friends at a nearby restaurant. She was three years old.</p> <p>Brückner remains a suspect in Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange inquiry, which continues alongside investigations led by German and Portuguese authorities. Police in all three countries have carried out searches in Portugal over the years, most recently near the municipality of Lagos in June 2023. Investigators have also combed areas around the Barragem do Arade reservoir, 30 miles from Praia da Luz, where Brückner was known to have spent time.</p> <p>DCI Mark Cranwell, the senior investigating officer for Operation Grange, said officers would continue their work despite the suspect’s refusal to cooperate.</p> <p>“For a number of years we have worked closely with our policing colleagues in Germany and Portugal to investigate the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and support Madeleine’s family to understand what happened on the evening of 3 May 2007 in Praia da Luz,” Cranwell said.</p> <p>“We are aware of the pending release from prison of a 49-year-old German man who has been the primary suspect in the German federal investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance. We can confirm that this individual remains a suspect in the Metropolitan police’s own investigation.</p> <p>“We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an international letter of request which has been submitted. It was subsequently refused.</p> <p>“In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry. We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing.”</p> <p>Brückner is serving a seven-year sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in Praia da Luz in 2005 and could be released on Wednesday. He has consistently denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p> <p>Between 2000 and 2017, Brückner lived intermittently in southern Portugal, and prosecutors have confirmed he was in the Algarve around the time Madeleine vanished. German authorities have described him as their chief suspect, though he has not been charged in connection with the case.</p> <p>Last October, a German court acquitted him of unrelated sexual offences alleged to have taken place in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.</p> <p>Since its launch in 2011, Operation Grange has received more than £13.2m in Home Office funding after a further £108,000 was secured from the government in April.</p> <p>Madeleine’s case remains one of the most high-profile unsolved disappearances of recent decades, attracting international attention and repeated appeals for information.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/my-conscience-is-clear-prince-harry-on-ukraine-his-family-and-the-media",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: The duke talks about the cost of war, his portrayal in the press and boxing as the Guardian joins him on a visit to Kyiv</p>",
    "content": "<p>It’s about midnight. It’s raining. A small group is huddled around a lonely roadside cafe somewhere near the border between Poland and Ukraine, getting wet in the drizzle, sharing cartons of chips and bottles of beer.</p> <p>One of the bedraggled men wonders out loud why on earth the owner of the cafe would choose to close now, when surely this must have been the busiest it has ever been, stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, with a captive and hungry audience.</p> <p>Everyone laughs. It turns out, Prince Harry can be quite funny.</p> <p>It helps to keep things jolly as the security detail work out how to ferry everyone from here to the train that will take them on a secretly planned trip to Kyiv.</p>    <p>The aim of the visit is to promote the work of the Duke of Sussex’s Invictus Games Foundation (IGF), and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of the thousands of veterans there who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago.</p> <p>Because of the sheer numbers of wounded, Invictus has become increasingly well-known in Ukraine, and Harry, somewhat surprisingly, has achieved cult-hero status.</p> <p>The Guardian accompanies him on the journey to the capital – something of a gamble for both sides, as Harry noted. He is suspicious of the media, and the Guardian has long been critical of the monarchy.</p> <p>And over the next 36 hours, we learn a lot – big and small – about this complex, conflicted man. He doesn’t like posing for staged photographs, and he doesn’t like cycling (“I have a bony ass”); he likes to box to relieve his frustration – “hitting the hell out of a bag”, he says, helps him to decompress.</p>    <p>In private he is very informal, padding around in his socks on the train to and from Kyiv and making dad jokes.</p> <p>In public he has a confident voice and an easy charm with strangers, but on his own he is softly spoken and asks questions about people, and about politics. He has views.</p> <p>He is not, he says, the unhappy man some of the press like to portray him as, but yes, he wants to spend more time in the UK.</p> <p>Does he regret putting his side of the story in the very public way that he has? No he doesn’t. “My conscience is clear.”</p> <p>He talks a little about his mother, Diana, and his father too. If Invictus is his professional priority, it seems clear his father is a personal one.</p> <p>But all that comes out on the way back to the UK; what is happening in Ukraine is his immediate concern, and for good reason.</p> <h2><strong>‘One of the saddest things I have ever seen. Also one of the most beautiful’</strong></h2>    <p>The statistics are shocking and they are on the rise.</p> <p>The war in Ukraine has left at least 130,000 people with life-changing injuries, many of them double and triple amputees or with disfigured faces.</p> <p>With no sign of the conflict ending, the Ukrainian government has put using sport as a way to help the recovery and rehabilitation of these veterans at the heart of a national policy, and the country’s prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, has turned to Invictus for inspiration and help.</p>        <p>Ukrainians themselves have embraced the whole concept. The men and women who have taken part in the biennial Invictus Games have become national heroes and front-page news.</p> <p>But these competitions only involve small numbers, and the need is vast.</p> <p>So Invictus has been devising programmes to help veterans all over the country get access to sports facilities. At a reception on Friday morning, the IGF team are guests at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, where they meet ministers and dozens of the recovering wounded.</p>      <p>“Sports recovery and rehabilitation did not exist in Ukraine before Invictus,” Ruslan Prykhodko, the deputy minister for veterans affairs, tells the Guardian.</p> <p>“Now we are creating a whole system with different kinds of training and preparing teams in all kinds of sports.”</p>    <p>And it’s here that Harry’s popularity among Ukrainians becomes very clear.</p> <p>The injured want to talk to him, the mothers and fathers of the wounded and dead want to shake his hand, or hug him. He is cheered and clapped at every turn, as are his colleagues.</p>    <p>“It’s amazing. We never expected this level of recognition,” says Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans trauma centre in Lviv, which has worked closely with Invictus in Ukraine.</p> <p>“Ordinary people know who he is. We honestly didn’t know he had become such a celebrity. I think Prince Harry coming here is a symbol of victory and power. People look at him and his military experience and they see he is not afraid to come to Ukraine. It is so important that he came.”</p>    <p>For this, and for the other causes he is passionate about, Harry accepts his “front and centre” role and does it willingly. Encouraging those who have been seriously injured to find a purpose outside the military is one of his messages.</p> <p>“I would say that I have been fortunate,” he says. “The one thing that people miss when they hang up their uniform is purpose.</p> <p>“Losing a sense of community and being part of a team, and of course the camaraderie and adrenaline. But at the heart of it is your job, your role is serving a purpose larger than yourself.”</p> <p>His work for Invictus, he says, has given him that after his military career. It “saved me”.</p>    <p>Changing attitudes across society about disabled people is another core message.</p> <p>“Seeing people with prosthetics and life-changing injuries is going to be the norm in Ukraine for the coming decades,” he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>“Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities. It’s about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.”</p> <p>Such is the need for men and women to fight the war, some of the wounded have even ended up back in the military.</p> <p>“A lot of the participants in the Invictus Games go back to active service,” says Helen D’Oyley, the IGF’s chief growth officer. “Ukraine has become our key strategic priority because of the need there is here.”</p> <p>Later in the day, the team stops at Maidan Square in the heart of Kyiv, where an unofficial memorial to the dead has sprung up. It is a moving and ever growing field of photos of the dead, flags, messages and flowers.</p> <p>Harry wanted to lay a wreath, but as the crowds grow around him, he steps into the thick of the memorial to be on his own.</p>    <p>“I wanted to find a spot to lay the wreath in peace away from everyone. My God it’s like a maze in there. I didn’t appreciate how far back it went. Honestly, it is one of the saddest things I have ever seen. But also one of the most beautiful.” The war, he suggests, could and should have been avoided. “It is all so unnecessary.”</p> <p>After this visit, the prince disappears. His car heads off away from the convoy for about an hour and when he returns to the group, he is coy and tight-lipped.</p> <p>The suspicion is that he has gone to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but neither he nor the president wants to admit it.</p> <p>Zelenskyy is a champion of the Invictus Games and had made it known he wanted to meet the prince. The British government had made it known to Zelenskyy it would rather he did not. That was the chat in diplomatic circles, at least.</p> <p>The theory was that giving the rebel royal a platform might not be smart politics on a day that Britain’s new foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was also in town.</p> <p>But only one Briton is making any headlines in Ukraine on Friday.</p>    <h2><strong>‘I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live</strong><strong>’</strong></h2> <p>The trip to Kyiv comes at the end of a busy week for Harry.</p> <p>From Monday to Thursday he was in the UK, undertaking a series of events related to the causes he supports. He also met his father, King Charles, for the first time since February 2024. On an overnight train heading back to Poland, Harry says he thinks the whole week has gone well, and feels hopeful about the future.</p> <p>During the trip, some elements of the tabloid press have published stories that left his team with their heads in their hands.</p> <p>It appears to make Harry more certain of the need to take on the papers who, he says, have unfairly targeted him and his family.</p> <p>The prince, along with Doreen Lawrence and Elton John among others, is suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>A trial is due to start in January.</p> <p>“Yes, I have enjoyed the week,” says Harry. “I have always loved the UK and I always will love the UK. It’s been good to reconnect with the causes I am passionate about. I have been able to spend some time with people that I have known for so long. It is hard to do it from far away.”</p> <p>He adds: “It is only in certain elements of the press where you see this talk about me being down or saying I am not smiling. This comes from people who think they know what I am thinking and how I am feeling. They are wrong.</p> <p>“I think parts of the British press want to believe that I am miserable, but I’m not. I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live.”</p> <p>If he hasn’t always seemed cheerful, then that is hardly surprising, given what he has been going through, he says.</p> <p>“I have certainly had to deal with some very stressful events over the last four years. There has been the uncertainty and stress of the litigation and finding out certain things that have really, really hurt.”</p> <p>But he believes there is a disconnect between what is written about him by some commentators, and what most other people think.</p>    <p>“I feel a lot of support from the British public. Even now, when I feel like I have been destroyed by certain members of the British press.</p> <p>“It serves them to think that the British public feels the same way about me as they do.</p> <p>“But I don’t feel that and I don’t see that. For as long as I have known, certain elements of the British press have tried to speak on behalf of the nation. I think they are out of touch with the nation on lots of things.</p> <p>“They hope to bring the public with them, but … I think the British public can speak and think for themselves.”</p> <p>Would he like to spend more time in the UK? To bring his children one day, despite the issues over his security arrangements?</p> <p>“Yes I would. This week has definitely brought that closer.”</p> <p>Harry won’t talk about his father, but he seems to suggest he wants, and needs, to see his father more often.</p> <p>Over the coming year, he says, “the focus really has to be on my dad”.</p> <p>Harry mentions his wife, Meghan, only once by name, a reference to something she told him about how telling the truth “is the most efficient way to live”.</p> <p>“She said ‘just stick to the truth’. It is the thing I always fall back on. Always.</p> <p>“And if you think like that, who would be stupid enough to lie? It takes up too much time and effort.”</p> <p>Which brings him to the very public things he has said about his life; the interviews, the TV series and the book he wrote, Spare.</p> <p>“I know that [speaking out] annoys some people and it goes against the narrative. The book? It was a series of corrections to stories already out there. One point of view had been put out and it needed to be corrected.”</p> <p>He adds: “I don’t believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.”</p> <p>Being called stubborn slightly rankles with him. “It’s not stubbornness, it is having principles.”</p> <p>It seems he does not want to prolong any legal battles.</p> <p>He does not ever expect to get positive coverage from some quarters – a ceasefire is, perhaps, the best he can hope for.</p> <p>“It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,” he says.</p> <p>Nor does he want to prolong any divisions with his family.</p> <p>But in life, he says, “you cannot have reconciliation before you have truth”.</p> <p>Harry, who turns 41 on Monday, appears a bit bemused by his popularity in Ukraine.</p>      <p>By the end of the visit he has so many bags of presents to take home, including a dagger hidden inside an ornate walking stick, they take up most of the free space in the back of the private jet that returns him to the UK.</p> <p>He puts it down to the fact he served 10 years in the army, and the way Ukrainians have adopted the ideas of the Invictus Foundation.</p> <p>He is told that Rudnieva thought part of the reason people liked him was because he is quite Ukrainian in his attitude to life: he does his own thing, in his own way.</p> <p>“You know who else did that?” says the prince. “My mum.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>British authorities may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/source-of-data-are-electric-cars-vulnerable-to-cyber-spies-and-hackers\">certain concerns</a> about the cyber-spying threat from vehicles made in China, but it turns out the country’s manufacturers have security worries of their own.</p> <p>Insurers have told Chinese carmakers they need critical modifications for vehicles on British streets: namely, tougher locking devices to make them harder to steal.</p> <p>With an average of 11 reported vehicle thefts an hour in the UK, and car crime comparatively rare under Beijing’s strict authoritarian regime, industry sources said it had been a “swift learning curve”.</p> <p>Additions to cars exported to the UK from China have ranged from the simply mechanical, such as lockable wheel nuts and an extra layer of steel around the car door locks, to software to detect and guard against unauthorised entry.</p> <p>Sales of Chinese cars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/chinese-carmakers-buck-market-trend-report-soaring-uk-sales\">have risen sharply</a> in Britain this year, now accounting for about one in 12 of all new cars sold, including those made by MG and electric car firm BYD. New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.</p> <p>New models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.</p> <p>Ben Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.</p> <p>“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”</p> <p>He added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”</p> <p>Chery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.</p> <p>Oli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/24/smart-keys-car-crime-thieves-hi-tech-arms-race\">Gone in 20 seconds: how ‘smart keys’ have fuelled a new wave of car crime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for BYD, which in two years of UK sales has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/28/tesla-sales-in-europe-slump-byd-new-car-registrations-more-than-triple-elon-musk\">grown to overtake Tesla</a>, said it had worked with Thatcham to learn about UK theft prevention and had “devoted significant efforts to enhancing vehicle anti-theft performance and insurability in the UK market”.</p> <p>They added: “We have implemented a wide range of technologies and hardware tailored to local expectations, including advanced anti-theft locking systems and optimisations in vehicle component structures.”</p> <p>According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, reported total vehicle theft in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables\">rose to 102,000</a> in the year to the end of March 2025.</p> <p>Chinese car crime data is not available, and while its official crime statistics are viewed as unreliable, anecdotally vehicle and other theft is perceived as far lower than in Britain.</p> <p>A spokesperson for International Motors, a UK distributor that imports Xpeng and GWM cars from China, said Korean and Japanese manufacturers had faced similar adjustments when first exporting here years before: “The UK requirements for safety and security are extremely stringent.”</p> <p>The UK’s most stolen car, however, is one that was once made in Britain: the Ford Fiesta, with more than 4,000 taken last year, according to Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures reported by What Car?</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s best phone that is still a pocketable, easy-to-handle size, taking the excellent Pixel 10 and beefing it up in the camera department.</p> <p>That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold.</p> <p>The 10 Pro looks almost identical to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/02/pixel-9-pro-review-small-phone-camera-google-android-ai\">last year’s version</a> and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">as the Pixel 10</a> but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling.</p>    <p>The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">Google Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat\">used in rivals</a>. Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates.</p> <p>The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left.</p>    <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Google Tensor G5</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 16</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 207g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Android 16 with AI everywhere</h2>    <p>The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705\">until August 2032</a>, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">regular Pixel 10</a> with a bold, colourful and fun design.</p> <p>Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy.</p> <p>The advanced <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/gemini-ai-assistant/\">Gemini chatbot</a> is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice.</p>    <p>But the standout new feature is <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en_uk/ideas/articles/magic-cue/\">Magic Cue</a>, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them.</p> <p>Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16476811\">Google AI Pro</a>, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>    <p>The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is.</p> <p>The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions.</p> <p>Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too.</p>    <p>Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable.</p> <p>When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script.</p> <p>The camera app adds <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\">C2PA content credentials</a> to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera.</p> <p>The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing.</p> <p>The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The battery <a href=\"https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/smartphonestablets20231669/2347995\">will last in excess</a> of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410\">with manuals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/en-gb/Parts/Google_Phone\">parts available</a>.</p> <p>The Pixel 10 Pro contains 30% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin.

But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features.</p> <p>It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years.</p> <p>Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps.</p> <p>Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish.</p> <p>The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> quite expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US, not a big upgrade from the standard Pixel 10.</p> </blockquote>",

Thirteen died that day. Another casualty who died four months later is widely considered a 14th victim.</p> <p>A tribunal led by Lord Widgery in 1972 cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing but a 2010 inquiry by Lord Saville concluded that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”. The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-report-saville-inquiry\">apologised</a> for the killings. Plays, films, books, documentaries and annual commemorations have kept Bloody Sunday in public consciousness.</p> <p>A court order granted Soldier F anonymity after defence lawyers argued he would be a “prized target” for dissident republicans if his identity was made public. When he appeared in court for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/06/bloody-sunday-ex-soldier-pleads-not-guilty-to-double-in-belfast-trial\">arraignment in December 2024</a>, he sat in a witness box that was shielded from the main body of the court by a thick floor-to-ceiling blue curtain. Similar arrangements are expected for the trial.</p> <p>Mr Justice Fowler will preside over the case without a jury, which is permitted in exceptional cases.</p> <p>At a pre-trial hearing in March, Soldier F’s legal team argued that inconsistencies in accounts by his fellow paratroopers and civilian witnesses meant there was insufficient evidence for a trial.</p>    <p>Prosecutors said “contestable evidence” would be addressed during the trial and that there was “overwhelming evidence” regarding Soldier F’s actions on the day the army opened fire on protesters in Derry’s Bogside.</p> <p>Authorising the case to proceed, Fowler said he accepted evidence that indicated that soldiers in Glenfada Park acted unlawfully in firing with high-velocity rifles at a group of unarmed civilians in a relatively confined courtyard. “In my view, it provides a sufficiency of evidence and it is not tenuous. Accordingly, the court discerns that the committal papers disclose a case sufficient to put the defendant on trial in respect of each of the seven counts on the indictment,” he said.</p> <p>The case will be closely watched by families of those who died on Bloody Sunday and veterans’ groups, as well as the Irish and British governments. London and Dublin are discussing ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/14/legacy-act-halted-investigations-into-202-troubles-related-killings-of-british-soldiers\">repeal the Legacy Act</a>, which was an attempt by the previous Conservative government to phase out prosecutions for Troubles-era alleged crimes.</p>",

    "content": "<p>So that’s it for the summer. The season comes to a close for us in the northern hemisphere this week on 22 September as we enter the autumn.</p> <p>The moment is marked by the autumnal equinox, which is the moment when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving south, and the days become shorter than the nights. The exact moment this happens is 19:19 BST on 22 September and it is caused by the movement of Earth along its orbit, gradually tilting the northern hemisphere away from the sun.</p> <p>The name equinox comes from the Latin aequus, meaning equal and nox, meaning night. Hence it is said that the equinox is when day and night are the same length, which would be true if Earth had no atmosphere.</p> <p>The effect of the air we breathe is to bend the light from the sun, so we actually see our parent star on the horizon before it has actually risen, and then again just after it sets. This gives a few extra minutes of daylight at the equinox.</p> <p>A few days later, the lengths of the day and the night really are equal. This is known as the equilux, and occurs on either 25 or 26 September depending on your precise location.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Consumer group says uncertified car seats that put lives of children in danger are being sold by leading online retailers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unregulated children’s car seats are being sold by leading online retailers in the UK, a Which? investigation has found.</p> <p>The consumer group discovered products for sale on platforms including eBay, Shein, Wish, Little Dreams and ManoMano that did not carry the orange certification labels showing compliance with regulation. Without these markings, parents cannot be sure the seats have been tested to the legal standard.</p> <p>Which? said the car seats were putting children’s lives at risk. Many were priced between £12.50 and £40, below the £80 starting price of certified models, leading to fears that families under financial pressure may choose to buy them.</p> <p>The organisation first exposed flimsy fabric seats in 2014 that collapsed in crash tests, prompting their removal at the time. It says the reappearance of uncertified models shows how unsafe or illegal products can slip back on to the market.</p> <p>While the latest examples have not been put through formal testing, Which? said the lack of regulatory labels raised doubts about whether they were safe or legal to use.</p> <p>There were two seats without regulatory labels on sale on the online marketplace ManoMano, four on eBay, two on Wish.com and one on Shein and Little Dreams. Shein, eBay, Wish and Little Dreams removed the listings once they were flagged.</p> <p>The safety defects in these car seats include a thin seat base and not having one central point of release for the harness. Car seats must raise a child’s height to position the seatbelt correctly across their lap, and multiple buckles on the harness can make it difficult to rescue a child in the event of a crash.</p> <p>The seats also have a lack of side impact protection, which is needed to stop a child’s head from hitting the inside of the car. This omission leaves children vulnerable to head trauma or death in the event of a side impact, Which? said.</p> <p>Researchers at the consumer group also found confusing listings that described the items as car seats but included small-print disclaimers advising against their use in vehicles. One read: “Note: it is best not to use it on high-speed cars. We recommend that it be used in non-motorized products such as electric vehicles … Because it is not a child safety seat that complies with traffic.”</p> <p>The warning comes after the Product Regulation and Metrology Act, which strengthens consumer safety rules, received royal assent earlier this year. Which? is urging the government to introduce secondary regulations giving online marketplaces direct responsibility for ensuring goods sold on their sites meet safety requirements. It also wants stronger enforcement powers for regulators.</p> <p>Experts advise parents to: check that any seat has an approval label showing it complies with either ECE R44-03, R44-04 or R129 standards; avoid secondhand models that may have hidden crash damage; buy from reputable retailers that can advise on fitting; and be cautious of unusually cheap options.</p> <p>An eBay spokesperson said they “swiftly removed the listings reported by Which? and notified buyers. We have updated our existing measures accordingly and remain committed to preventing unsafe products from appearing on the site.”</p> <p>Shein said it took product safety “very seriously”, adding: “This product category is banned across Shein sites globally. In this situation, the seller had undertaken specific and targeted measures to avoid detection, in violation of our code of conduct. Upon being notified of the non-compliant product listing, Shein dealt with the situation immediately and removed the product listing.”</p> <p>Little Dreams did not provide a comment but told Which? it would review the product in question, remove the listing from its website, and conduct a thorough internal investigation to understand how this occurred.</p> <p>Wish said “the safety and wellbeing of our users is our foremost priority. We can confirm that all product listings highlighted have been removed.”</p> <p>ManoMano said it was “committed to the safety” of customers. However, it said products were “sold by the sellers under their sole responsibility … ManoMano acts solely as a technical intermediary … we are deeply committed to the safety of our customers and promptly remove any illegal products once we receive proper notification”. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Author of new book suggests Kernewek continued to be spoken in the 19th century, albeit in ‘tiny numbers’</p>",
    "content": "<p>The legend that Cornish vanished as a living language with the death of the fish seller <a href=\"https://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/people/dolly_pentreath.htm\">Dolly Pentreath</a> in the late 18th century is being challenged by one of the world’s leading experts on the Celtic culture of the far south-west of Britain.</p> <p>Pentreath, from the harbourside town of Mousehole on the Cornish south coast, died in 1777 aged 85 and the narrative developed that she was the last true speaker of <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-news/environment-culture-and-planning/learn-how-to-speak-kernewek-20-cornish-words-and-phrases-to-get-you-started/\">Kernewek</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/centres/ics/whoweare/kensa-broadhurst/\">Kensa Broadhurst</a>, of the Institute of Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter, has written a book in which she argues that the language <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90371-7\">clung on through the 19th century</a>, spoken by some working-class Cornish people as well as academics and others who saw value in preserving it.</p> <p>Broadhurst said that during that period Cornish should be classified as having been critically endangered rather than extinct. “The story of the Cornish language is one of resilience, not disappearance,” she said.</p> <p>Broadhurst, a bard of <a href=\"https://gorsedhkernow.org.uk/\">the Cornish Gorsedh</a>, which promotes<strong> </strong>Cornish Celtic culture, said Cornish was widely spoken in the far south-west in medieval times.</p> <p>By the time Pentreath was born in 1692, the number of speakers had dramatically declined, but she was said to have spoken only Cornish until she was in her 20s.</p> <p>Broadhurst said the story of Pentreath had to be treated with caution because her voice has vanished from history and much of what is known of her came from the writings of wealthy outsiders, who may have misrepresented her. “We’re talking about rich, educated men with leisure time,” Broadhurst said.</p> <p>Daines Barrington, an English lawyer, antiquary and naturalist, is generally credited with having “discovered” Pentreath. He reported that she “was bred up from a child to know no other language; nor could she (if we may believe her) talk a word of English before she was past 20 years of age; that, her father being a fisherman, she was sent with fish to Penzance at 12 years old, and sold them in the Cornish language.” Barrington also said she told him that nobody else could converse in Cornish.</p> <p>Broadhurst said it was also possible Pentreath was playing Barrington. “If you’re poor and this smart man who’s obviously got money is showing an interest, are you going to try and milk that? We just don’t know.”</p> <p>In the years after her death, the idea grew that the language had died with Pentreath. In 1860 a monument in her honour was set up in a churchyard describing her as “the last person who conversed in the ancient Cornish”.</p> <p>For her book, The Cornish Language in the Nineteenth Century, Broadhurst studied experts such as Frederick William Pearce Jago, who published a Cornish dictionary in 1887, and the Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner (1848-1934).</p> <p>Broadhurst said she believed Cornish continued to be spoken in the 19th century, albeit in “tiny numbers”.

    "description": "<p>Ex-MPC members say ‘quantitative tightening’ should be scaled back or halted entirely, saving the Treasury up to £10bn a year</p>",
    "content": "<p>Andrew Bailey has been urged by former Bank of England policymakers to ease pressure on the government’s borrowing costs by cutting back its bond-selling plans.</p> <p>In a crunch week for the economy, four influential ex-members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said a change in course was needed.</p> <p>Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">highest level in 27 years</a>, intensifying the pressure on chancellor Rachel Reeves before her 26 November autumn budget.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has blamed the rise on global factors., triggered by Donald Trump’s trade war and his assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>However, the Bank admitted last month that a £100bn programme of bond sales to unwind its crisis-era quantitative easing scheme is also playing a role.</p> <p>With the government under pressure on the economy, the central bank is widely expected to keep its base rate unchanged on Thursday at 4%, but could signal a slowdown in its bond-selling plans for the next 12 months.</p> <p>The Bank’s decision comes in a busy week for economic news, with official data due on the jobs market and inflation, as Reeves gears up for a challenging autumn budget.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former MPC member, now at the consultancy Oxford Economics, urged the Bank to scale back its disposals amid febrile conditions in markets.</p> <p>“It is highly likely they will slow the pace … The gilt market and bond market in general are weak and volatile,” he said. “Current conditions are such that a higher pace of active sales might have an undesirable effect on pushing up yields further.”</p> <p>A second ex-MPC member, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “It definitely has to be reduced. Not reducing it would be completely tone deaf to what’s happening in the global bond markets.”</p> <p>Threadneedle Street intervened during the depths of the financial crisis to buy UK government bonds – aiming to crash borrowing costs close to zero – in a programme that was ultimately expanded up to reach £895bn in total.</p> <p>The Bank is now winding down quantitative easing – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – and has shed about £100bn of bonds in the past year through active sales and allowing maturing debts not to be replaced.</p> <p>It still has a portfolio worth about £560bn, having disposed of most of its holdings at a loss.</p> <p>City investors widely expect the Bank to scale back its QT programme to about £70bn for the year ahead. However, this would involve maintaining active sales at current levels because fewer gilts are due to expire over the next 12 months.</p> <p>Sushil Wadhwani, who was on the MPC between 1999 and 2002, called for a halt to active sales entirely amid worries over the impact of QT on the bond market.</p> <p>“On monetary policy grounds, the Bank should switch to passive QT [only allowing maturing debt to expire],” he said. “Irrespective of what Andrew Bailey says, the 30-year yield has a significant impact on confidence in the UK economy. I have foreign investors bring it up all the time.”</p> <p>Scaling back the Bank’s QT programme could help the chancellor by easing some of the pressure on long-term gilt yields. Such a step would also save the Treasury money because Threadneedle Street has been selling its bonds at a loss.</p> <p>Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, said cutting the Bank’s QT programme to about £70bn was sensible because markets expected such a reduction. However, he warned Reeves against banking on any windfall.</p> <p>“The job of the Bank is not to make the chancellor’s life easy. Its job is to control inflation. And a modest winding back on QT would be quite consistent with that.”</p> <p>In a rare piece of upbeat news for the chancellor, a survey by trade body Make UK suggests an upturn in the key manufacturing sector in the third quarter, with output and export orders rising.</p> <p>Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said all the indicators in the survey, carried out by consultancy BDO, had improved.</p> <p>“After a period of considerable uncertainty in global markets, these figures are an encouraging sign that manufacturers’ confidence is improving and, more importantly, being translated into growth and investment.</p> <p>“However, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and with UK and European markets in particular remaining anaemic it wouldn’t take much to knock prospects for further growth.” </p> <p>The IPPR thinktank has estimated that halting active sales – matching the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank – could save the Treasury more than £10bn a year.</p> <p>However, holding on to the bonds would not be cost free, because the Bank earns less interest on its gilt portfolio than it pays out on commercial bank reserves.</p> <p>Last month, the IPPR called on Reeves to raise taxes on the country’s biggest banks amid windfall profits on their reserves parked at Threadneedle Street. Some economists have also called for the Bank to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/04/a-simple-solution-to-rachel-reeves-spending-cuts-stop-subsidising-the-banks\">pay lower rates of interest</a> on some commercial bank reserves.</p>",

Now councils must only hold a public consultation before scrapping the restrictions, meaning dozens of odd rules have been junked over the past decade.</p> <p>These include a 120-year-old ban on transporting dead horse carcasses in the London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham; a 1956 bylaw prohibiting the drying of clothes in various parks in Whitstable; and a 50-year-old rule outlawing types of fish frying in Gloucester.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Ensuring England’s workforce has the right skills for a rapidly changing economy is key to Labour’s hopes of boosting social mobility and kickstarting economic growth.</p> <p>So it seems unfortunate that more than a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">Keir Starmer’s drastic reshuffle</a>, ministers are still wrangling over exactly which bits of the skills agenda will now move to Pat McFadden’s beefed-up Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p> <p>Broadly speaking, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is expecting to hang on to responsibility for further education, while McFadden will probably take on apprenticeships and adult skills. Jacqui Smith, the skills minister, will work across both departments.</p> <p>Labour market experts say there is some logic to the shift: ensuring the right training is available in the right places is one crucial part of tackling the issue of economic inactivity in a rapidly changing employment market, which falls within the DWP’s bailiwick.</p> <p>But “machinery of government” changes, as official parlance has it, can often bring more disruption than clarity.</p> <p>Over the past two decades alone, responsibility for skills has bounced around Whitehall, from education into the short-lived Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (2007-09) then on to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2009-16), back into education again, and now across to the DWP.</p> <p>Perhaps this nomadic status helps account for successive administrations’ chronic neglect. Government spending on adult education halved between 2011-12 and 2019-20. It then recovered somewhat as the worst years of austerity came to an end, but by last year it was still £1bn down in real terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-construction-workers-the-country-needs-more-of-them-fast\">The Guardian view on construction workers: the country needs more of them, fast | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, despite endless speeches by politicians of all stripes about how vocational skills should have the same status as university (I have sat through quite a few: it is compulsory to mention Germany), the numbers of people completing apprenticeships have collapsed.</p> <p>Official figures show 178,220 people earned an apprenticeship in England in 2023-24, down by more than a third on 2017-18, when the apprenticeship levy was introduced.</p> <p>Recently rebranded as the skills and growth levy, this is charged at 0.5% of the payroll of larger firms.

It must surely be a piece of the UK’s productivity puzzle that, <a href=\"https://learningandwork.org.uk/resources/research-and-reports/raising-the-bar-increasing-employer-investment-in-skills/\">according to the Learning and Work Institute</a>, employers’ annual spending on training for each member of staff has fallen by 28% in real terms since 2005, to £1,530, a level less than half the EU average.</p> <p>The longtime education expert Sir Philip Augur put it well in a recent <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/are-kids-ok-college-years\">Institute for Fiscal Studies podcast</a> about post-16 education. Welcoming the changes to the apprenticeship levy, Augur said: “Employers have to step up to the plate here. For employers, ‘I can’t get the staff’ is quite often an excuse for bad management. Now, on this occasion, they can’t get the staff because the skills aren’t there. But there needs to be honesty and self-appraisal on the part of employers.”</p> <p>Augur called for the levy to rise “very slightly” to free up more resources for expanding apprenticeships.</p> <p>McFadden’s team say he is keen to ensure young people get the skills they need to benefit from the jobs scheduled to be created by new government investment in defence and green energy. That will mean working with firms and unions to get the training landscape right.</p> <p>There is plenty of innovative thinking going on at local level. The West Yorkshire mayor, Tracy Brabin, announced plans last week for what she called “skills-led growth” in Wakefield, the UK’s largest city without a university.</p> <p>She hopes to <a href=\"https://www.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/all-news-and-blogs/wakefield-sets-out-plan-for-skills-led-growth-to-transform-uk-economy/\">establish a new Wakefield Futures Centre</a>, led by employers, where local people can do courses directly linked to finding work in the fastest-growing sectors in the surrounding economy. The idea is to make the courses flexible so that adults with caring responsibilities, for example, can take up the offer. </p> <p>This kind of relatively fluid, employer-connected approach could allow mums to pick up new skills, or older workers to switch sector or dip their toe in the market after a period off sick, for example.</p> <p>It could also be used to tempt young people to think about a wider set of options: in Manchester, Andy Burnham is pushing to set up an Mbacc – an Ebacc equivalent, intended to be an alternative to GCSEs, which is tailored to local jobs.</p> <p>Jobcentres, which are getting a rejig under Labour to present a more encouraging face, can then signpost to local opportunities such as these.</p> <p>Getting the skills offer right will have to form one crucial part of any genuine effort to bring down the UK’s unusually high economic inactivity rates, and therefore, ultimately, the welfare bill.</p> <p>Last year’s crass attempt at cuts failed because Labour could not justify to its own MPs the crude way in which it planned to cut eligibility for the personal independence payment (Pip).</p> <p>If the government wants to have another go – as McFadden certainly does – then a fresh skills and training offer could be part of the package for the hard-to-reach claimants Labour said it had a “moral case” to help last time&nbsp;– but for whom across-the-board Pip cuts would have done nothing.</p> <p>It’s not a quick fiscal fix by any means, but get it right and the upside, for individuals, employers and the economy, would be significant and long-lasting. The sooner ministers can clear up who takes on which bits of the task, and crack on with it, the better.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Research shows most patients can read extra lines on eye test charts after twice-daily treatment</p>",
    "content": "<p>Doctors have developed special eye drops for people with longsightedness that could replace the need for reading glasses or surgery.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have presbyopia, which is when the eyes find it difficult to focus on objects and text up close. Glasses or surgery can usually resolve the problem but many find wearing spectacles inconvenient and having an operation is not an option for everyone.</p> <p>Now experts say the solution could be as simple as using eye drops twice a day.</p> <p>A study presented on Sunday at the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) in Copenhagen showed that most people could read extra lines on eye test charts after using the drops. The improvement was sustained for two years.</p> <p>The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.</p> <p>The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.</p> <p>The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.</p> <p>They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.</p> <p>In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.</p> <p>Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.</p> <p>“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”</p> <p>The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.</p> <p>Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches. </p> <p>Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>National Association of Cider Makers says warm spring and summer have produced special apples ‘full of rich flavours and natural sweetness’</p>",
    "content": "<p>“If you love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-experienced-its-hottest-summer-on-record-in-2025-met-office-says\">cider</a>, this is cider to the power of 10,” says Barny Butterfield, speaking about the flavours packed by some of this year’s “special” apples.</p> <p>Indeed Butterfield, the owner of Sandford Orchards, near Exeter, is buying extra tanks to increase cider production after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-experienced-its-hottest-summer-on-record-in-2025-met-office-says\">UK’s hottest summer</a> on record resulted in an abundance of fruit.</p> <p>“I think God’s a cider maker,” he joked. To thrive, fruit trees need heat and light and this year “we had lots of both”.</p> <p>“I’ve had boughs breaking on trees under the weight of fruit,” Butterfield continued. “It’s probably going to be the best vintage since 2018.” </p> <p>With more than 20 years in the business, he declared: “It might even be the best in my cider-making lifetime. We’re looking at an incredibly special year.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">Core principles: the return of ‘real’ cider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The National Association of Cider Makers (NACM) says the warm spring and summer have produced apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness”, despite the fact that the reduced rainfall means the fruit is slightly smaller than average.</p> <p>“I’ve heard from cider makers and growers that the sugar and tannin levels are very high, which means the quality of the fruit will be outstanding,” said the NACM chair, David Sheppy, who is also the managing director of Sheppy’s Cider. “It is going to be a good year for quality.”</p> <p>The record-breaking summer temperatures this year that contributed to the abundance of apples was made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change, the Met Office concluded in an analysis published earlier this month. The mean temperature across June, July and August was 16.1C (70F), significantly above the current record of 15.8C set in 2018, with the country also seeing four heatwaves across a single season.</p>    <p>Sheppy, whose family has 36 hectares (90 acres) of orchards in Somerset, said the trees had “suffered a little bit”. Mature trees “don’t mind a dry spell”, he said, but the stress of the dry weather meant he had observed a small number that had split and lost their branches.</p> <p>Cider-producers have moved to make the most of this year’s bumper crop. Sandford Orchards, which makes Devon Red cider, has installed eight new 50,000-litre (11,000-gallon) tanks and Butterfield is particularly excited to have lots of Tremlett’s Bitter apples, meaning Sandford Orchards can bottle a single variety for the first time in seven years.</p> <p>He describes their “leathery and marmaladey” notes and “rich natural sweetness”.</p> <p>There is also good news for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/06/perry-pear-cider-round-up-fiona-beckett-drinks\">perry</a> drinkers after last year’s disaster. Albert Johnson, director of Ross-on-Wye Cider &amp; Perry Company bills it as a “bounceback year”.</p> <p>“Last year was so bad for perry pears, probably over half the crop was wiped out by the bad conditions in the growing season,” he said.</p>    <p>It is a different story this year. “If anything, the pear sugars are up even more than the apples, and there’s plenty of them. So it’s a really exciting year for perry.”</p> <p>Industry figures show that while UK cider sales edged up slightly to £3.1bn in 2024, the overall amount drunk declined by about 3% to 676m litres. Sheppy, the sixth generation of his family to work in cider-making, said the industry “had been in decline, but it’s picking up again”.</p> <p>“It’s coming back,” he said of the sector, which supports about 65,000 jobs. “There’s a lot of innovation and new ideas, both around reducing alcohol content but also at the higher end … to appeal to the modern drinker.</p> <p>“Like a lot of industries, cider goes through phases. But there’s a strong passion for the industry in this country. It’s a close connection with the land and farmers.”</p> <p>Sheppy’s harvest started at the end of last week. “We grow 40 different varieties of apples,” he said. “The earliest ones are ripening now but the main cider apple varieties, like Dabinett, Harry Masters and Yarlington Mill, are ready mid- to late October, early November. That’s the key time.”</p> <p>But even if this year is one to remember, Sheppy is keen to point out that the industry doesn’t have “bad years”, only “bad harvests”.</p> <p>“It’s not like when you get a wetter harvest, the quality is not as good, because that’s all in the blending process. We can blend a good year with a bad year and maintain the quality, that is part of the art of being a cider maker.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>An embrace of private equity and publicity missteps have diluted the craft beer company’s original rebel ethos</p>",
    "content": "<p>There comes a time in every punk’s life when they are no longer the snarling face of the <em>avant garde</em>. </p> <p>In the UK beer community, opinion is divided about exactly when that sobering moment arrived for BrewDog, the self-styled “punk” brewery founded in Scotland in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/04/brewdog-posts-37m-loss-as-sales-growth-slows-to-just-1\">whose once-fizzing sales are now turning flat</a>.</p> <p>Some point to the <a href=\"https://www.punkswithpurpose.org/\">2021 open letter</a> by Punks with Purpose, a group of BrewDog staff who claimed to have endured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/10/brewdog-staff-craft-beer-firm-letter\">a toxic “culture of fear”</a>, engendered by the company’s bombastic and showmanlike founder James Watt.</p> <p>“For those who had given them the benefit of the doubt, that was the moment when people thought that they don’t deserve to be held up as a paragon of independent beer,” says Matt Curtis, the founding editor of the drinks magazine Pellicle.</p>    <p>Others go back further, to when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/09/punk-beermaker-brewdog-sells-22-of-firm-to-private-equity-house\">investment group TSG Consumer Partners paid £213m for a 22.3% stake</a> in 2017. To the chagrin of some, BrewDog continued soliciting investment from the crowdfunders who had fuelled its initial growth, even after taking the private equity money.</p> <p>“That was a tipping point,” says the beer and food writer Melissa Cole. “After a private equity company has invested, can you still go back to the well of your fans?”</p> <p>Watt’s personal and professional antics since stepping down as chief executive last year, broadcast relentlessly on social media, seem to have completed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/08/little-remains-of-brewdogs-punk-ethos-as-co-founder-james-watt-steps-down\">migration into the establishment</a>.</p> <p>“I compare the history of post-punk music with craft beer,” says Pete Brown, a beer writer and author of Tasting Notes: The Art and Science of Pairing Beer and Music.</p> <p>“I’ve got a slide with [former Sex Pistols frontman] John Lydon doing the Country Life butter commercial next to a picture of James Watt attending Nigel Farage’s birthday party.</p> <p>“It’s like the French Revolution … inevitably the revolutionaries become the reactionaries.”</p> <h2>Peak BrewDog</h2> <p>Views may differ about when the brewer lost its countercultural credentials, but there is little dissent among beer connoisseurs about one thing: we have reached – and probably passed – peak BrewDog.</p> <p>Outside what Brown calls the “beer bubble”, though, the hangover from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/24/the-aggressive-outrageous-infuriating-and-ingenious-rise-of-brewdog\">raucous growth story</a> that defined the company for so long is only just setting in.</p> <p>Since it was founded, sales have grown every year by at least 9% – and often at a much more rapid clip – even during the Covid-19 pandemic. But financial results for 2024 released earlier this month brought that remarkable winning streak to a close. Takings all but flatlined in 2024, rising by less than 1% to £357m.</p> <p>Net revenues, which take into account the duty sliced off the top of a pint and sent to the Treasury, actually fell slightly. The company is taking on more debt, at sky-high interest rates, from TSG.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/YLlZe/3/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/YLlZe/3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>James Taylor, the second chief executive since Watt announced his departure 18 months ago – and the third James in a row to run the business – pointed investors towards his preferred “adjusted” operating profit measure.</p> <p>At that level, BrewDog returned to the black, but only to the tune of £7.5m. Pre-tax losses over the past two years amount to nearly £100m.</p> <p>So far, 2025 has offered little solace. BrewDog’s products, including its flagship Punk IPA, have been axed from 2,000 pubs as customers opted for rival beers. Last month, the brewer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/brewdog-to-close-10-bars-amid-extremely-difficult-time-for-hospitality-industry\">said it would close 10 of its own UK bars</a>, including on its home turf in Aberdeen.</p> <p>Some of this is down to environmental factors. The sluggish economy has constrained consumer spending across hospitality, while gen Z, a cohort who might have been expected to drink BrewDog 10 years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/28/i-know-my-limit-how-gen-z-became-britains-sober-curious-generation\">are now swerving alcoholic indulgence</a>.</p> <p>BrewDog says reports of its decline are exaggerated. Jettisoning loss-making bars will reduce costs, it argues, trimming a division that had over-expanded.</p> <p>The company also plays down the impact of being elbowed off the beer pumps at so many pubs. They point to new distribution deals with big venues, including West Ham United’s London Stadium, the Isle of Wight festival and that lodestar of punk culture, Lord’s cricket ground.</p> <p>These, say a spokesperson, have delivered more than three times the volume of sales lost from pubs.</p> <p>But the notion of peak BrewDog is about much more than the financials. It is, say observers, the inevitable culmination of years of behaviour that have gradually chipped away at BrewDog’s rebel image until there was almost nobody left who believed in it.</p> <h2>From brash to cringe</h2> <p>Everything seems right with the world when you’re <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkMbDEtHB0A\">throwing stuffed toy cats out of a helicopter</a>.</p> <p>The 2015 stunt – intended to mock “fat cat” beer companies – was just one of many thought up by Watt and his fellow co-founder Martin Dickie, who followed his partner out of the exit door earlier this year.</p>    <p>Their brash marketing strategy elicited the odd eye-roll, but on occasion, the duo badly misread the room.</p> <p>That same year, to send up their crowdfunding efforts, the pair filmed themselves begging and posing as sex workers. Thousands signed a petition calling the caricatures offensive.</p> <p>Their Pink IPA – a mock “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/brewdog-pink-beer-for-girls-punk-ipa\">beer for girls</a>” released on International Women’s Day 2018 and supposedly intended to challenge stereotypes – didn’t get many laughs from women in beer.</p> <p>By and large though, drinkers loved this brand of devilment, while those in the industry recognised that a rising tide lifted all boats and that in the early days at least, BrewDog was making good beers.</p> <p>“I was gushing about what they were doing,” says Curtis. “They were bringing the impetus from that US beer scene into the UK, which is what it needed.”</p> <p>He credits BrewDog with fostering talented people who went on to run breweries themselves, echoing the old line that everyone who bought the first Velvet Underground record went on to start a band.</p> <p>Brown points out that BrewDog has been a victim of revisionism too, from people who like to pretend they were always too cool for it. “They’ll say the beers were always shit. No they weren’t. They are now but they weren’t back then.”</p> <p>But the publicity missteps – not to mention the dissonance caused by the company’s corporatisation – became less trivial.</p>    <p>In 2017, BrewDog attracted criticism for threatening two small bars with legal action, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/27/brewdog-backs-down-lone-wolf-pub-trademark-dispute\">one for using the name Lone Wolf</a> – the same as a spirit brand that BrewDog was trying to launch, and another – against a Leeds pub – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/brewdog-lawsuit-bar-punk-brewer-pub\">for calling itself Draft Punk</a>.</p> <p>The irony of trying to copyright punk was not lost on beer fans.</p> <p>Then came the 2017 private equity investment and, in 2021 the bombshell Punks with Purpose open letter.</p> <p>In response to mounting criticism, Watt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/11/brewdog-co-founder-apologises-to-ex-staff-over-toxic-working-environment\">acknowledged some of his failings and apologised</a>. But he reacted with fury to a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0013yfj\">BBC documentary</a> that raised further questions about his behaviour. The Guardian revealed that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/brewdog-boss-accused-of-trying-to-intimidate-ex-staff-over-tv-expose\">hired private investigators to gather information on people</a> who had spoken to the BBC.</p> <p>One seemingly minor but telling detail that emerged was that Watt, such a vocal critic of Big Beer, even owned shares in the Dutch brewing giant Heineken.</p> <h2>Dog days are over?</h2> <p>Last year, the company faced a new staff backlash after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/10/brewdog-faces-staff-backlash-after-dropping-real-living-wage-pledge\">dropping its commitment to the real living wage</a> and then over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/brewdog-sacks-asian-woman-over-reaction-to-edl-members-meeting-in-bar\">handling of a decision by the EDL</a>, a far-right group, to use its Waterloo bar as a meeting point for a rally.</p> <p>More recently, Watt has courted ridicule for social media posts, including videos filmed alongside his former reality TV star partner Georgia Toffolo, in which he has railed against taxation on business and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/17/for-richer-or-poorer-brewdog-co-founder-may-delay-marriage-to-max-out-tax-relief\">mooted delaying the duo’s wedding to avoid a potential tax hit</a>.</p> <p>“People have looked at how he behaves, looked at the brand and thought they’d rather drink something else,” says Cole. “BrewDog has just totally lost its identity. Whether it was all just smoke and mirrors is kind of irrelevant.”</p> <p>One cohort that BrewDog has always been able fall back on was its army of shareholders, the “equity punks” who have a financial, as well as an emotional stake in the company, after taking part in its early crowdfunding rounds.</p> <p>Even their loyalty may be tested.</p> <p>BrewDog has previously indicated that it is seeking to float on the stock market, with valuations of up to £2bn bandied about. Faltering progress since then appears to have made a valuation even half that size fanciful.</p> <p>Detailed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da2dc2e-8791-421a-bf60-0de83de6d961\">analysis by the Financial Times</a>, published earlier this year, concluded that weak profitability, with the terms of the investment by TSG may have rendered the equity punks’ stakes worthless.</p> <p>If that turns out to be true, then some may look from BrewDog to the faceless brewing giants that they once mocked and find it impossible to tell which is which.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A corporate intelligence company part-owned and formerly run by the prime minister’s business adviser has been paid more than £1m by Thames Water as the utilities firm tries to avoid renationalisation, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt, which was run by Varun Chandra until his appointment as Keir Starmer’s business adviser last July, has worked with Thames since 2023, providing political and strategic advice.</p> \n<p>That commercial relationship between Thames and Hakluyt has continued since Chandra joined No 10. He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.</p> \n<p>That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/varun-chandra-starmer-adviser-proving-vital-link-for-labour-in-us-trade-talks\">still owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluyt</a> and is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.</p> \n<p>In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.</p> \n<p>Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.</p> \n<p>The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.</p> \n<p>It was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.</p> \n<p>Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.</p> \n<p>The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/rachel-reeves-thames-water-creditors\">wrote to creditors of the company in July</a> to say a “market-based solution” was her preference.</p> \n<p>Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.</p> \n<p>Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.</p> \n<p>That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.</p> \n<p>A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/bidders-demand-thames-water-granted-immunity-over-environmental-crimes\">leniency from fines and penalties</a>. They have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/creditors-set-out-20bn-plan-to-save-thames-water\">delivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five years</a> than had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.</p> \n<p>Chandra is one of Starmer’s most influential advisers, and has spearheaded its attempts to ingratiate Labour with business and attract foreign capital to the UK.</p> \n<p>He accompanied Reeves on her visit to the World Economic Forum in January, and was in the Oval Office when Starmer met Donald Trump in February.</p> \n<p>Chandra has also been central to Labour’s more muscular attempts to burnish its business credentials. It is understood he was behind the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/chair-of-competition-watchdog-steps-down-after-labour-intervention\">oust the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, Marcus Bokkerink</a>, amid concerns the watchdog was holding back growth.</p> \n<p>The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in South Shields, Chandra helped Tony Blair set up his first advisory firm, before becoming Hakluyt’s managing partner in 2019. As of May he held Hakluyt shares worth about £7m<strong>.</strong> The company, which was founded in 1995, was named after the Elizabethan writer, priest and diplomat Richard Hakluyt.</p> \n<p>Hakluyt has reportedly said it plans to buy back Chandra’s shares over time and that he no longer has any voting rights or decision-making roles within the company.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the company said: “Hakluyt is a global strategic advisory firm providing insight and advice to commercial clients on a range of issues. We are not a lobbying organisation and do not lobby governments on behalf of clients.”</p> \n<p>A Thames spokesperson said: “We remain focused on a market-led solution which we believe is in the best interest of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy.”</p> \n<p>A No 10 spokesperson said: “The Cabinet Office has a thorough process on declarations of interest for special advisers to ensure any conflicts of interest are properly managed and mitigated, including through recusals where appropriate.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>A man has been arrested after a Sikh woman said she had been left “deeply affected” by what police are treating as a racially motivated rape in the West Midlands.</p> <p>The woman, described as a British-born Sikh in her 20s, told police a racist remark was made to her during the assault in the Tame Road area of Oldbury on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>The perpetrators allegedly told her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out,” as they attacked her between 8am and 8.30am, according to the Sikh Federation (UK).</p> <p>West Midlands police said on Sunday evening that a man in his 30s had been detained as part of inquiries into the assault. He remains in custody on suspicion of rape. The woman is continuing to receive support as the investigation continues.</p> <p>In a statement released through the Sikh Federation, the victim expressed her gratitude to her community. “I want to sincerely thank everyone for supporting me and my family during this very difficult time,” she said. “We are going through a lot, but the strength and kindness shown by the right people in the community has been incredible, and I can’t thank them enough for being my voice.</p> <p>“I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us. Through it all, my family has been my rock, and my community has stood strong beside me.</p> <p>“The police are doing their best to find those responsible and I truly hope they are caught so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”</p> <p>Ch Supt Kim Madill, of West Midlands police, described the arrest as a “significant development in the investigation”. She said: “We want to thank the community for their continuing support. The investigation remains ongoing and we would urge people not to speculate as we work to identify and trace all those who may have been involved.”</p> <p>Police previously said they were looking for two white men in connection with the attack. The first was described as having a shaved head and a heavy build, wearing a dark sweatshirt with gloves. The second was said to be wearing a grey top with a silver zip.</p> <p>Local MPs expressed their shock after initial reports of the attack. Sarah Coombes, Labour’s MP for West Bromwich, which includes Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.</p> <p>Gurinder Singh Josan, the Labour MP for Smethwick, previously said the “truly horrific attack” was being treated as a hate crime, while Preet Kaur Gill, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said she had been contacted by concerned constituents. She said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Police are searching for a man who called for Keir Starmer to be killed during Saturday’s “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London, with further arrests expected in the coming days after outbreaks of violence.</p> <p>Scotland Yard estimated that between 110,000 and 150,000 people attended the far-right event, organised by the activist known as Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>A total of 26 police officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled, and the Metropolitan police said on Sunday that 24 people had been arrested for a range of alleged offences including common assault and violent disorder.</p> <p>The force said a post-event investigation was under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.</p> <p>The oldest person arrested was 58, the youngest 19, and the average age of those arrested was 39. Three of those arrested at the protest were women.</p> <p>A man who said on camera that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated” and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”, and whose comments were published online, is among those being sought by police.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: “We’re aware of a video circulating on social media from the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest on Saturday. Officers are investigating and enquiries are ongoing to identify a man.”</p> <p>Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was among those who addressed the crowds from a stage, along with a range of other far-right figures. However, there were no-shows by promised speakers including Steve Bannon, a former strategist for Donald Trump, and Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and author.</p> <p>Speakers included the owner of X, Elon Musk, who claimed a “dissolution of parliament” was needed and said “massive uncontrolled migration” was contributing to the “destruction of Britain”, in comments made via video link.</p> <p>Others who appeared on the same stage included the former Reform UK deputy leader Ben Habib, who is setting up a rival party to the right of Reform known as Advance UK, which Robinson says he has joined. European far-right figures including the former French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour and Danish and German parliamentarians also took part.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate described it as Britain’s largest-ever far-right protest. Joe Mulhall, the counter-extremism campaign group’s director of research, said it was concerning that such a big crowd had come together to cheer speakers who called for the banning of all public expression of non-Christian religions, demanded the “remigration” of legal migrants, pushed Covid conspiracy theories, and claimed Britain was being “invaded” and its population “replaced”.</p> <p>“This was unprecedented,” he said. “The messages that were coming from the stage and radicalisation of that crowd are a step change even from the days of the English Defence League.</p> <p>“The EDL might have been more violent but what we are now seeing is something that has broadened out from a street movement into a much wider attack on everything from multiculturalism to LGBT rights.</p> <p>“The language from the speakers and the reception from the crowd were for positions that we might have regarded as being on the ‘extreme’ of the far right in the past, but it’s worrying now that it’s becoming almost normalised,” Mulhall added. “We’re also even seeing in some sections of the media a pushback against the fact that this was a far-right rally.”</p> <p>The rally was opposed by a smaller counter-protest organised by Stand Up to Racism, which estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 had taken part. Organisers said some of them were assaulted and were hit by projectiles.</p> <p>At one point the counter-demonstration was broken into two parts while Robinson supporters who had blocked the opposing protesters from leaving Whitehall had to be moved by police.</p> <p>Robinson’s next moves are unclear, although there is potential for a political route via his association with Advance UK, which would be eager to capitalise on the bloc of support Robinson is able to mobilise and that could eat into Reform UK’s support.</p> <p>However, his past forays into politics have not been successful. Robinson, who was a member of the British National party in the past, won only 2.2% of the vote and lost his £5,000 deposit when he stood in north-west England in elections for the European parliament in 2019.</p> <p>He has already indicated that he plans to organise another big rally in future but has not given further details. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Gurpreet Singh Johal wants to know if stops are linked to his efforts to find out whether UK intelligence played a role in sibling’s arrest</p>",
    "content": "<p>The brother of Jagtar Singh Johal, a British Sikh jailed in India, has written to the Home Office to ask why he is being repeatedly stopped at the airport by British border police.</p> <p>Gurpreet Singh Johal, a Labour councillor in Dumbarton, asked if it was linked to his legal efforts to discover whether British intelligence played a role in his brother’s arrest eight years ago.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “I have been repeatedly stopped at the British border, and no explanation is being given. I don’t know if this is an attempt by someone to intimidate me, but I am not going to stop seeking redress for my brother who has been in jail since 2017 without full trial.”</p> <p>A UK court hearing is due in a few weeks’ time in which Jagtar’s lawyers, including from the legal organisation Reprieve, will seek to discover if he was arrested in India in 2017 after a tipoff by British intelligence. Much of the UK hearing is likely to be held in closed session.</p> <p>Jagtar has not been found guilty in any Indian court, and a series of delays caused by the Indian prosecutor’s inability to assemble credible witnesses mean he has been detained without full trial.</p> <p>Charges against him at state level in Punjab were dismissed by the court in March 2025 as no evidence or witnesses were produced. The largely identical federal-level charges being brought by India’s National Investigation Agency remain.</p> <p>Gurpreet says he has been stopped four times in the last two years when he has returned to the UK from holiday. Neither the Home Office nor Police Scotland have given him explanations that justify him being taken aside in front of his family. He was stopped at Heathrow in November 2023 and twice at Glasgow airport in April and July 2024 and once in July 2025. Each time he was told at the e-gates to “seek assistance” that then led to a set of inquiries.<br><br>After years of delay, Gurpreet’s rare legal tort claim against the British intelligence services is due to reach the court on 6 October. The closed proceedings, made necessary by the involvement of the British intelligence services, mean Jagtar’s own lawyers cannot be present, but parts of the first hearing will be open to media and the public.</p>    <p>Jagtar’s legal team is arguing that a member of the British intelligence services appears to be the individual described anonymously in the 2020 annual report by the UK’s Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO),<sup> </sup>which sets out how MI5 and MI6 passed information to foreign authorities about a British national who was then detained and tortured.</p> <p>The report said the case had been raised by the then UK prime minister with Indian authorities. Theresa May is known to have raised Jagtar’s case in 2018 with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other circumstantial evidence suggests the case referred to is Jagtar’s.</p> <p>Jagtar’s British lawyers are asking the government to admit the individual was Jagtar, grant him redress for the harm he has suffered, to recognise that its actions were unlawful and publicly apologise for its role in his suffering.</p> <p>His lawyers claim he was severely tortured after he was arrested in Jalandhar, Punjab, three weeks after his wedding. At the time local media reported that a British Sikh had been arrested on the basis of a tipoff from British intelligence. The alleged torture led to a false confession, his lawyers say.</p> <p>British rules required ministerial consent for intelligence sharing to occur where there was a risk of torture. The foreign secretary at the time was Boris Johnson, and the court would probably hear if he authorised the sharing of the information with the Indian authorities.</p> <p>A second possible explanation for Gurpreet’s experience is that the British police have generally increased their targeting of British Sikhs, probably in the wake of pressure from the Indian government.</p> <p>Gurpreet said: “Being stopped this number of times, sometimes for long periods without proper explanation is concerning. I am being asked by my children at the airport what I have done wrong and I cannot tell them except I am campaigning to get my brother released from an Indian jail, or that this is straightforward discrimination. It will certainly not lead to me dropping the case against the British intelligence services.”</p> <p>The Home Office has refused an explanation for the stops, citing the Data Protection Act where complying with the right of access to the information on why he is being stopped “would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime”.</p> <p>In addition, the Home Office claims the border police have a right to stop individuals in the national interest. Police Scotland referred the issue to the Home Office and said there had been no request from Police Scotland for him to be stopped.</p> <p>A UN working group on arbitrary detention has determined that Jagtar’s detention “lacks [a] legal basis” and is based on “discriminatory grounds” owing to his Sikh faith and his “status as a human rights defender”, and that Jagtar was subjected to torture.</p> <p>Jagtar is accused of being a member of a terrorist group, the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), which has carried out attacks in the Punjab region.</p> <p>The charges against Jagtar state that he travelled to Paris in 2013 and delivered £3,000 to other KLF figures, with the money then used to purchase weapons employed in a series of murders and attacks against Hindu nationalist and other religious leaders in 2016 and 2017.</p>",

    "content": "<p>My friend Ken Brown, who has died aged 88, was a social anthropologist, sociologist and senior lecturer at Manchester University for two decades. </p> <p>He was born in Los Angeles to Rose (nee Glesby) and Samuel Brown, who ran a family clothes shop in Beverly Hills. They lived in West Hollywood, where Ken attended Hollywood high school. At 18 he went to Chicago University, graduating in history in 1957; soon after that he went to Jerusalem, where he met Josy Cohen, a librarian, who later became a social worker. They married in 1958.</p> <p>The couple moved to Los Angeles, where Ken embarked on a doctorate at UCLA. His research topic was the ancient city of Salé, near Rabat, so he and his young family spent two years in Morocco in the mid-1960s.</p> <p>After completing his studies Ken won a Fulbright scholarship to Manchester University, where in 1971 he became a lecturer in its social anthropology department, and then its sociology department. Manchester brought stability to the family, but Ken’s heart was in fieldwork and he undertook social anthropological research trips to Morocco, Tunisia, Jerusalem and Palestine. Although he was a senior lecturer in the sociology department, he became increasingly fed up with academic politics and in the late 80s he eagerly accepted an offer of early retirement.</p> <p>In 1991 he founded <a href=\"https://www.mmsh.fr/fait-maison/cinumed-cite-numerique-de-la-mediterranee/revue-mediterraneans-mediterraneennes-ideas-new-writing-images/\">Mediterraneans</a>, a book-format review that explored the cultures of countries around the Mediterranean. It made quite a stir in its first issue, with contributions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/14/juan-goytisolo-obituary\">Juan Goytisolo</a>, Lawrence Durrell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary\">John Berger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/11/jacques-berque-algeria-arab-culture-france\">Jacques Berque</a>, Yannis Ritsos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/11/poetry.israelandthepalestinians\">Mahmoud Darwish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/15/jean-mohr-obituary\">Jean Mohr</a>. </p> <p>For issue three Ken moved operations to Paris. where funding was more easily secured. He was the editor and director of publication throughout its run; he sometimes had to forgo his salary in order to publish the magazine or pay one of the employees. Right up until its final issue, No 15, in 2011, the publication depended on his remarkable ability to persuade people and institutions to support his concept.</p> <p>Malise Ruthven had noted in the Times Literary Supplement that “it would be a tragedy if the journal were to fold”. But fold it did, though much of it can today be found online.</p> <p>Josy died in 2020. Ken is survived by their children, Daniel, Yorick and Tamar, and seven grandchildren.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sainsbury’s hopes of offloading its retail business Argos to one of China’s biggest retailers have collapsed as talks ended on Sunday.</p> <p>The supermarket giant confirmed it was no longer in discussions with JD.com to sell Argos, the general merchandise arm it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">bought for more than £1bn</a> less than a decade ago.</p> <p>On Saturday it had announced talks with JD.com for a sale that it said would speed up the transformation of Argos, whose business has gone increasingly online and within larger Sainsbury’s branches.</p> <p>But 24 hours later, Sainsbury’s said the deal was off. It said: “JD.com has communicated that it would now only be prepared to engage on a materially revised set of terms and commitments which are not in the best interests of Sainsbury’s shareholders, colleagues and broader stakeholders. Accordingly, Sainsbury’s confirms that it has now terminated discussions with JD.com.”</p> <p>JD.com, which is unrelated to JD Sports, is one of China’s biggest retailers and also provides its supply chain-based technology and services across other sectors. Last year, JD.com walked away from a deal to buy the UK white goods and electronics retailer Curry’s.</p> <p>Argos is the UK’s second largest general merchandise retailer, behind Tesco, with the third most visited retail website in the UK, according to Sainsbury’s. It retains almost 200 standalone stores – with kiosks where customers used to peruse its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/30/argos-to-stop-printing-catalogue-after-almost-50-years\">famous catalogue</a> – and more than 1,100 collection points, mostly in Sainsbury’s stores.</p> <p>Before the collapse, Sainsbury’s had talked up the potential deal as accelerating its turnaround of Argos, saying: “JD.com would bring world-class retail, technology and logistics expertise and invest to drive Argos’s growth and further transform the customer experience.”</p> <p>A sale would almost certainly have commanded a far lower figure than the £1.1bn Sainsbury’s paid in 2016 for Home Retail, the then owner of Argos. Sainsbury’s latest accounts valued the chain at £344m, and the group said growth at the main supermarket business was weighed down by falling Argos profits.</p> <p>Some retail analysts have questioned the supermarket’s transplanting of the Argos operation into its stores. Hundreds of standalone Argos stores were closed as the business restructured and moved more to online shopping.</p> <p>In 2023, Sainsbury’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/sainsburys-to-close-two-argos-distribution-sites-risking-1400-jobs\">closed down two Argos distribution centres</a> and the business’s head office in Milton Keynes in a further attempt to cut costs.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was 11.40am, 20 minutes before parents were due to collect their children from a Taylor Swift-themed workshop in Southport on a warm, sunny day at the start of the summer holidays.</p> <p>One of the mothers decided to hang the washing out. It was too early to pick her daughter up, she thought. It was an ordinary decision, on an ordinary morning. But it is one that has haunted her ever since.</p> <p>Five minutes later, at 11.45am on Monday 29 July 2024, Axel Rudakubana walked into the Hart Space, hood up, and entered the first-floor studio. Many of the 26 young girls were gathered around a table making bracelets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/11/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-teenage-girl-stabbed\">Teenage girl stabbed twice in Southport attack relives day ‘like horror film on repeat’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first, they thought he was there to show off a puppy belonging to the instructor, Leanne Lucas. Then he grabbed a child. They thought it was a fake knife, fake blood. Running and screaming, one girl thought they were playing hide and seek.</p> <p>Their innocence was shattered in seconds. In just 12 minutes, the 17-year-old carried out the most barbaric knife attack on British children in modern times. He inflicted hundreds of injuries that are too distressing to recount.</p> <p>For the first time, families of 22 of the girls present that day have spoken about its horrifying impact in emotional testimony to a public inquiry at Liverpool town hall.</p> <p>Over five days of harrowing testimony, the inquiry heard how many of those stabbed only survived due to the expert care of police, paramedics, strangers and surgeons. But the psychological scars run searingly deep.</p> <p>They suffer nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks. They are unable to sleep alone, triggered by blood, screams, sirens – even open doorways like the one Rudakubana walked through.</p> <p>The parents of the three young girls who were murdered – six-year-old Bebe King; Elsie Dot Stancombe, aged seven; and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine – will appear before the inquiry on Monday.</p> <p>The hearings will then examine how such a troubled teenager with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/20/axel-rudakubana-a-ticking-timebomb-who-murdered-three-girls-in-southport\">well-known obsession</a> with knives and extreme violence – who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/25/axel-rudakubana-from-unassuming-schoolboy-to-notorious-southport-killer\">referred three times</a> to the counter-radicalisation scheme Prevent – was able to carry out what the inquiry chair, Sir Adrian Fulford, called “one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history”.</p> <p>Fulford, a retired senior judge, has signalled that he will make far-reaching recommendations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/08/southport-inquiry-to-examine-wholesale-failure-to-prevent-attack\">when he reports to the government</a> in the coming months. These are expected to include a consideration of new powers to restrict the liberty of people when there is strong evidence they intend to carry out an attack but not enough to justify an arrest.</p> <p>In the wake of the attack, ministers said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/20/yvette-cooper-to-create-new-offence-to-cover-non-terrorist-planning-of-attacks\">they plan to “close the gap” in legislation</a> so police can arrest those suspected of planning an attack but who, like Rudakubana, have no fixed ideology.</p> <p>Fulford has accepted that such restrictions may run counter to the “basic underpinnings of our democracy and civil liberties” but that the gravity of the attack – and what he described as the “wholesale and general failure” of authorities – could justify such measures.</p> <p>More than a year later, some of the girls and their parents remain too traumatised to speak about what happened. One was only able to discuss it with her counsellor in July, a year on.</p> <p>The mother of one little girl, who can only be identified as Child O, said that day “marked the end of her carefree childhood”.</p> <p>A bright, confident, joyous girl had been turned into a nervous wreck. Though physically unharmed, she is unable to be left alone, startled by noise, fearing that the killer was “coming to find her, to finish what he started”.</p> <p>“The flashbacks and intrusive thoughts were unbearable,” her mother said. To cope, the little girl sat from dawn until dusk making bracelets, keeping her mind busy.</p> <p>“Her little fingers working tirelessly because stopping meant the memories flooded back. If she paused, she broke down. That was the only way she could survive the days in the beginning.”</p> <p>Special occasions bring extra worry, particularly Halloween and Christmas. Many can no longer attend birthday parties due to the noise and chaos. “On Christmas Eve, she could not be alone in her bedroom,” said one mother of her young daughter. “The idea of Father Christmas, a man she does not know, entering our house filled her with fear instead of excitement.”</p> <p>The inquiry also heard accounts of heroism. One gravely injured girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/girl-saved-sisters-life-by-shielding-her-from-southport-attacker-inquiry-hears\">shielded her younger sister from the killer’s blows</a>, allowing her to escape. Others helped the smaller children to run, placing their hands on the railing of the stairwell, no doubt saving their lives.</p> <p>Heidi Liddle, a dance instructor who helped lead the event, spoke for the first time about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-dance-teachers\">“crushing” guilt</a> and feeling “responsible” for what happened. Liddle had saved one girl by locking them both inside a toilet as Rudakubana tried to get in. But she had avoided contacting the families, she said, because she worried she would not be welcome.</p> <p>The day after Liddle gave evidence, the mother of that little girl said the class leader had saved her daughter’s life: “I owe everything to Heidi for having the foresight to protect my daughter.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/man-stabbed-tackling-southport-killer-scene-horror-jonathan-hayes\">Man stabbed while tackling Southport killer describes scene of ‘horror’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From next week the inquiry will hear evidence from MI5, counter-terror police, social services, officials from as many as six government departments, and Amazon, where Rudakubana purchased the 20cm (8in) knife days earlier, despite being underage. The killer’s older brother, Dion, may also testify.</p> <p>Of all the searching questions raised by this catastrophe, they must answer the biggest one of all: “Why wasn’t he stopped?” It was a question put to the inquiry by a teenage girl who was photographing the event when she was stabbed twice.</p> <p>“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again,” she said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 28-year-old man has admitted to starting a fire that destroyed the constituency office of Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>Joshua Oliver, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to arson, with the resulting fire wrecking the Washington and Gateshead South MP’s office in the early hours of Thursday.</p> <p>The guilty plea was entered at Newcastle magistrates court on the basis that it was reckless rather than intentional. The crown did not accept the basis of the plea.</p> <p>The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases called Niemann-Pick UK (NPUK). An NHS mental health service for veterans was based in the same building.</p> <p>Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Oliver had been living in a tent nearby, the court heard. District judge Kate Meek remanded him in custody to appear at Newcastle crown court on 14 October.</p> <p>Oliver was charged with arson of Vermont House, Washington, with the damage estimated at between £250,000 to £500,000, and he admitted starting a fire in a wheelie bin that then spread.</p> <p>Heather Bolton, defending, said: “He accepts he has set fire to the wheelie bin, he didn’t intend for the fire to spread to the building.”</p> <p>The defendant was told a decision will be made whether a Newton hearing, which would rule whether the offence was intentional or not, will be necessary.</p> <p>Oliver also admitted burgling the building when he stole a mallet and power tools on the night. He admitted three counts of criminal damage, namely smashing windows at Vermont House, in the days before the fire.</p> <p>The defendant also admitted twice smashing windows at his father’s house in Sunderland in July.</p> <p>The district judge said he will be sentenced for all offences at the crown court.</p>",

It still contains an ornate fireplace that the poet gifted to the then owners.</p> <p>In November last year, DePree said, Rochdale council “suddenly locked the gates to the hall without any warning whatsoever”, with the local authority saying the American had not upheld his part of the deal.</p> <p>“It was a big shock and really devastating,” he said, “because so many of our volunteers from the community have been putting in five years rescuing the gardens that were completely in rack and ruin, and they turned them around into award-winning gardens.”</p> <p>DePree said he had “no confidence” in the council to secure the future of the building, and wanted to be allowed to carry on with the restoration project he had been spearheading for the best part of a decade.</p> <p>The actor said it was “really upsetting” to be told he had not made enough progress on the project, adding: “It’s been years and years of my life.”</p> <p>“I sold my house to help enable everything moving forward, and I left everything behind,” he said. “At this point, it’s been over 10 years that I’ve been involved, and I moved to England in 2017.</p> <p>“I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of my own personal money to make this happen.</p> <p>“I’m completely invested in it, and also I believe in the community,” he added. “I know how much hard work that we put in that at this point, this building has to be saved.”</p> <p>DePree said he has spent almost 11 months “trying to work with Rochdale council to find a resolution”, but now felt he had been “left with no choice but to sue Rochdale council in the high court” in order “to force them to honour our agreement”.</p>    <p>DePree’s lawyer, Nick Wells, said: “We have reviewed many years of documents and emails and eventually obtained some previously unseen evidence through freedom of information and subject access requests, many of which Rochdale borough council tried to block.” </p> <p>Wells said “the evidence points to the council having changed its position since entering into the option agreement in 2017”.</p> <p>“We are therefore asking the high court to intervene and hold Rochdale council to the decisions that they made in 2017,” he added, “rather than the decisions they have purported to have made in 2024.”</p> <p>In a previous life, Michigan-born DePree was an actor, film-maker, and writer, who once won a deal with Warner Bros to produce and star in his own television show.</p> <p>He grew up listening to stories of the family’s ancestral home in England, but believed them to be fairytales, until he began researching his family tree online, and discovered his Manchester roots.</p> <p>“I’ve given up my life for this building,” he said. “I came over to visit it first in 2013, just to see it. My grandfather was also named Hopwood, so he told me stories about it.</p> <p>“I felt that if I didn’t do something that it would fall into being lost forever,” he added. “So I gave up my life. I moved over from the US to the UK. I completely trusted the council at the time; I thought we were working in partnership together.”</p>    <p>Rochdale council said it does not comment on continuing legal proceedings, but pointed to previous statements it had made about the hall.</p> <p>A spokesperson said in November: “In 2017, the council entered into an options agreement with Hopwood DePree which gave him the option to buy the building for a nominal fee if he could produce a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall, alongside a detailed planning permission.</p> <p>“Although this agreement has been renewed a number of times since 2017, a viable business case and funding strategy has not been forthcoming, and so the council’s cabinet has made the decision to not renew the options agreement.”</p> <p>“The council sees Hopwood Hall as a very important part of Middleton’s heritage,” the spokesperson said, adding that alongside other public bodies such as Historic England, it had invested almost £1.7m into the building over the past seven years.</p> <p>The council said it had “commissioned independent financial consultants to assess the business model proposed by Hopwood Productions and they concluded that these proposals would be loss-making and unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding”.</p> <p>“As Hopwood Depree has not been able to produce a viable proposal, despite having had seven years to do so,” the council said that in order to protect public money invested in the building it had “a responsibility to explore alternative options”.</p> <p>“The council remains committed to the long-term future of the hall,” the spokesperson added, “and is keen to see it restored, so it can be brought into a viable future use.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Signs tout a natural paradise, but pollution from over-farming has left Northern Ireland’s Lough Neagh choked by toxic algae</p>",
    "content": "<p>The bright, cheery signs dot the shoreline like epistles from another era, a time before the calamity.</p> <p>“Ballyronan marina is a picturesque boating and tourist facility on the shores of Lough Neagh,” says one. “Contours of its historical past embrace the virginal shoreline.”</p> <p>Another sign boasts that the “rich ecological diversity and abundance of salmon and eels” has sustained communities there for thousands of years, since the stone age.</p> <p>A roadside billboard declares the Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Cooperative Society to be Europe’s biggest producer of wild eels. Yet another sign tells visitors that this majestic landscape of water and sky inspired Seamus Heaney’s Nobel-winning poetry.</p>    <p>Beauty, ecology, heritage, tourism, fishing – the UK’s biggest lake, sitting in the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, had bragging rights to fill a hundred signs. But now they line the shoreline as testaments to hubris because of an environmental disaster.</p> <p>The 400 sq km (150 sq mile) freshwater lough is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/19/like-the-flip-of-a-switch-its-gone-has-the-ecosystem-of-the-uk-largest-lake-collapsed-aoe\">choking on recurring toxic algal blooms</a> that coat the surface, kill wildlife, unleash stenches and make the lake all but unusable. Eel fishing has been suspended and tourists have fled.</p> <p>The lough and surrounding watercourses are on course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/30/uk-largest-lake-lough-neagh-faces-environmental-crisis-as-rescue-plans-stall\">record their worst year</a>, with at least 171 detections of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) growths, according to a<a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c2a28780d7554bed9d1f47f3ae710fa4/page/bluegreenalgaemap#data_s=id%3AdataSource_3-19174534d65-layer-3%3A3908\"> government pollution tracker</a>. The algae’s return was a “distressing but timely reminder of the need to urgently turn the tide on the ecological crisis”, Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The main cause is an overload of phosphorus and nitrogen from agriculture, including farm runoff, fertilisers and animal waste. Inadequate wastewater treatment facilities and septic tank leakage aggravate the problems. Additional factors are sand extraction, warming water and proliferating zebra mussels, an invasive species.</p> <p>The Stormont executive agreed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/22/pollution-plan-must-cut-intensive-farming-for-lough-neagh-to-survive\">rescue plan last year</a> but has balked at reining in polluters, prompting condemnation from Claire Hanna, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party: “Lough Neagh is dying in front of our eyes. Images of fish and eels gasping for life on the surface are not just shocking – they are a stark warning of total ecological collapse.”</p> <p>This week an activist, Bea Shrewsbury, attempted to present a “Lough Neagh smoothie”, drawn from the lake, to assembly members at Stormont. Police escorted her away.</p> <p>The lough supplies 40% of Northern Ireland’s drinking water, which is treated and said to be safe. Not everyone is convinced. “I’ve not drunk from the tap in a year,” said Brigid Laverty, 67, who lives by the lake. This week the Food Standards Agency said toxins have been found in the flesh of some fish for the first time but that commercially harvested fish remained safe to eat.</p>    <p>The water should be light brown but has turned green, said Peter Harper, an environmental officer with the <a href=\"https://loughneaghpartnership.org/\">Lough Neagh Partnership</a>, a nonprofit group. In some places the sludge – so widespread it is <a href=\"https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/?zoom=11&amp;lat=54.61781&amp;lng=-6.27286&amp;themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&amp;visualizationUrl=U2FsdGVkX1%2BoH4aEyDaWug7G8pS03N929e5oUXTIjwOiCd8gp%2Bxzse%2FG8gRwy6jpJ3F59S1CcxNmbNkreJmjeE16e8EFvmNYsmOTxmIMM%2B2sAUe%2BG%2Fol9wSvOkMxVb5%2B&amp;datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS&amp;fromTime=2025-08-17T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;toTime=2025-08-17T23%3A59%3A59.999Z&amp;layerId=1_TRUE_COLOR&amp;demSource3D=%22MAPZEN%22&amp;cloudCoverage=30&amp;dateMode=SINGLE\">visible from space</a> – forms mosaic-type patterns and swirls redolent of Gustav Klimt, said Harper. “It can be weirdly beautiful.”</p> <p>The impact on wildlife is incalculable, making the tourism-themed shoreline signs a grim joke. “What lies beneath?” says one. “A world of ancient history and astounding myths is waiting just below the surface. What unique creatures have made the lough their home?”</p> <p>Another sign exhorts visitors: “This special place deserves respect … please keep dogs on leads.” It urges swimmers to be careful because conditions can change fast. But there are no swimmers, and virtually no boats, because there is no demand and algae clogs engines.</p>    <p>A more recent sign, tacked to a lamp-post at Ballyronan marina, is more up to date: “Spotted a dead wild bird? Use the DAERA dead wild bird reporting tool service if you find dead gulls, waders, ducks or swans.”</p> <p>DAERA is the department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs – a bureaucracy that critics say prioritised the farms and agrifood companies that expanded pig, chicken and cattle numbers in the past decade and overloaded the soil’s ability to absorb nutrients. They did so with official blessing in a “going for growth” strategy.</p> <p>“It was not thought through,” said Gerry Darby, the manager of the Lough Neagh Partnership. “I’ll put it another way. The guy who did the calculations about nutrient levels knew fuck all about fuck all.”</p>    <p>Muir, of the Alliance party, said his department had completed or made good progress on most of the 37 points in an action plan agreed last year, but said Stormont faced “difficult decisions” over key measures. Sinn Féin and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dup\">Democratic Unionist party</a>, who dominate the executive, appear to have stalled the nutrients action programme over fears of a farmer backlash.</p> <p>Darby said there was no magical solution, only trade-offs, but still expressed confidence that politicians would take the necessary measures. “The lake is not dead,” he said. “It could be dead if things continue as they are.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Thousands of asylum seekers left without lawyers after firm took on thousands of cases with just five solicitors</p>",
    "content": "<p>An immigration law firm that signed up thousands of asylum seekers and generated income of £1.7m in legal aid in the last year, despite only employing five solicitors to represent them, has had its government contract terminated after concerns about its performance, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The decision leaves many asylum seekers struggling to find new legal representatives at a time when the government is increasing the number of cases it refuses.</p> <p>In the year ending June 2025 initial asylum grants fell from 58% to 48%, leaving more people having to lodge appeals, something that is difficult to do without a legal representative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/starmer-hope-not-hate-letter-racism-far-right\">Starmer urged to do more to push back against ‘onslaught of racism’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Middlesex Law Chambers’ legal aid income for immigration work dramatically increased from £43,000 in 2021 to £1.7m in 2025. The firm is <a href=\"https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/register/organisation/?sraNumber=8008175&amp;prevSearchText=Middlesex%20Law%20Chambers&amp;prevSearchFilter=\">listed</a> on the Solicitors Regulation Authority website as having 15 offices around the country, many in legal aid deserts such as Peterborough, Plymouth and Crawley.</p> <p>When the Guardian phoned these offices there was either no reply or a receptionist for the office block where the firm rented a space said it was no longer there.</p> <p>The director of Middlesex Law Chambers, criminal defence solicitor Sheraz Chowdhry, said the firm had planned to expand into those areas but in most cases had not done so and had now terminated rental arrangements for those office spaces.</p> <p>It currently has one solicitor employed at its Southall office doing private immigration work, one solicitor at an office in Canary Wharf in east London doing family work and a small team at its Uxbridge office doing criminal defence work. Legal aid contracts continue for those areas of work.</p> <p>Chowdhry joined the firm at the end of last year just months before the previous lawyer in charge of immigration work, Hina Choudhery, died from complications of cancer.</p> <p>He said: “Ultimately the firm, obstructed by Hina’s poor health over the last two years or so, has found it difficult to maintain its once very high standards in the immigration department.”</p> <p>He added he found out about the termination of the legal aid contract for immigration work just weeks ago. “The decision was also only communicated to us via email on 20 August 2025.”</p> <p>When asked to explain why the firm had expanded its caseload so dramatically and how it was possible to provide adequate legal representation for thousands of asylum seekers with just five immigration solicitors and a mix of 15 junior and more senior caseworkers, he said: “No solicitor was here during the expansion phase. It is difficult for me to explain how the firm suddenly grew so large in such a short space of time. I do not know.”</p> <p>A typical caseload for a legally aided asylum solicitor or caseworker is 15–20. With the number of staff employed by the firm during its period of rapid expansion each solicitor and caseworker would have had about 164 cases.</p> <p>Frances Timberlake, of Migrants Organise, which has many migrant members who complained about the service provided by the firm, said: “It is the Ministry of Justice’s duty to ensure that legal advice is available to people who need it. But decades of funding cuts and neglect to the legal aid system have left many people in our communities without any support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/03/legal-aid-cyber-attack-has-pushed-sector-towards-collapse-say-lawyers\">Legal aid cyber-attack has pushed sector towards collapse, say lawyers </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We urgently need funding for good legal advice and for the government to stop pushing migrants into hostile, expensive legal processes just as a charade for Reform,” she said.</p> <p>Dr Jo Wilding, a researcher and senior lecturer in legal aid at the University of Sussex and an immigration barrister, said: ‘This was completely foreseeable when one small firm with very few accredited staff set up offices in several new areas, including six serious advice desert areas, and started taking on hundreds of cases.</p> <p>“It should have been obvious that vulnerable people were being exploited but the Legal Aid Agency doesn’t seem to have identified or recognised that there was a problem. The solution to this is to stop treating legal aid for the most vulnerable people as if it was a market, and to pay that money to a reputable expert law firm or not-for-profit to do the work.”</p> <p>Rami, a former client of Middlesex Law Chambers, said: “It’s good that the government has stepped in and closed this firm. But it feels too late, because a lot of people like me have already suffered because of the work of this firm. I had to do my asylum interview without any real advice beforehand, holding my evidence in my hand that I had translated on Google because the law firm had not done it. I have lost a lot of time in my life because of this. I have grey hair now when before this I did not.</p> <p>“People seeking asylum face a lot of problems and a lawyer can help us to get through bad situations. But it is very difficult to find a legal aid lawyer and many people don’t speak English so cannot know which is a good law firm and which is not.”</p> <p>A Legal Aid Agency spokesperson said: “Middlesex Law Chambers’ immigration legal aid contract has been terminated.</p> <p>“Firms that hold legal aid contracts are subject to annual reviews. These can lead to financial sanctions or, as in this case, contract termination where standards are not met.”</p>",

You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long.</p> \n<p>“Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.” </p> \n<p>This is not the first time Musk has involved himself in British politics. He started a war of words with the UK government over grooming gangs and also criticised 2023’s Online Safety Act, calling the legislation a threat to free speech.</p> \n<p>He had a warm relationship with Nigel Farage, and there were even rumours he could channel a donation to his party before the Tesla boss called for the Reform UK leader to be replaced during a dispute over his support for Robinson.</p> \n<p>Musk told the crowd in central London: “My appeal is to British common sense, which is to look carefully around you and say: ‘If this continues, what world will you be living in?’</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69ef6a8b-ea31-4229-a361-f5cce4c7db80\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q0HHZbvvQOE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives.

You’re in a fundamental situation here.</p> \n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> \n<p>Musk also told the crowd “the left are the party of murder”, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">death of Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> \n<p>He said: “There’s so much violence on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week and people on the left celebrating it openly. The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. I mean, let that sink in for a minute, that’s who we’re dealing with here.”</p> \n<p>He also criticised what he called the woke mind virus and said decisions for advancement should be on merit rather than “discrimination on the basis of sex, or religion or any race or anything else”.</p> \n<p>He said: “A lot of the woke stuff is actually super-racist, it’s super-sexist and often it’s anti-religion, but only anti-Christian, like why anti-Christian? That’s unfair … that should be all that matters, the woke mind virus, that I call it, is against all that.”</p> \n<p>More than 110,000 people were estimated to have taken part in the far-right street rally, in what is thought to be one of the largest nationalist events in decades. The marchers were faced by about 5,000 anti-racist counter-protesters.</p> \n<p>In addition to Musk, figures including Katie Hopkins and French far-right politician Éric Zemmour were invited to speak at the event.</p> \n<p><em>PA Media contributed to this report</em></p>",

    "content": "<p>MPs have expressed their shock at reports of the racially motivated rape of a 20-year-old Sikh woman, said to have occurred in broad daylight.</p> <p>Detectives are looking for two white male suspects alleged to have racially abused the woman during the assault – they believe one suspect had a shaved head and wore gloves.</p> <p>The incident is alleged to have taken place on Tuesday morning in Oldbury, close to Birmingham. A Sikh community group said it had spoken to the woman and her family and that the words the attackers said were: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.” </p> <p>Police confirmed it was being treated as a racially aggravated attack and isolated incident.</p> <p>The attack took place off Tame Road, a short distance from the constituency office of Gurinder Singh Josan, MP for Smethwick.</p> <p>The MP said: “I understand the strength of feeling within the community this attack has generated. The community needs to allow the police to progress with the investigation.”</p> <p>Sarah Coombes, MP for West Bromwich including Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.</p> <p>MP for Birmingham Edgbaston Preet Kaur Gill said she was deeply shocked by the attack and that constituents had been contacting her to express their fear.</p> <p>Gill said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected, and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.</p> <p>“The rise in overt racism recently is deeply concerning, and I will be working with West Midlands police to ensure everything is being done to catch those responsible and to keep our community safe.”</p> <p>Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South, said he knew of people who had become scared for their safety due to an increase in “racist rhetoric” in the UK over the summer,</p> <p>He said: “Let’s be clear, this attack is a result of the rising racial tensions in our country and now, a young woman has been left traumatised for life.”</p> <p>The MP said several Ilford South residents had told him they were deeply concerned about the safety of women and girls in the area. He added: “This attack demonstrates the deeply tragic and violent consequences of allowing this rhetoric to seep into mainstream dialogue.</p> <p>“It ends in brown and black people being verbally attacked, physically assaulted or in this case sexually assaulted – a crime rooted in misogyny and the assertion of power.”</p> <p>Other Labour MPs who have spoken on the incident include Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, representing Slough, who urged police to “take decisive action to deliver justice”, as well as MP for Tipton and Wednesbury Antonia Bance.</p> <p>West Midlands police said on Saturday that officers were continuing to investigate the case, with a number of positive lines of enquiry ongoing.</p> <p>Ch Supt Kim Madill, who leads local policing in the Sandwell area, said on Friday: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other inquiries well under way.</p> <p>“We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused, and I am speaking to people in the community today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to identify and arrest those responsible.</p> <p>“Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols in the area.”</p> <p>Police said anyone with information could contact them via 101 quoting log 798 of 9 September.</p>",

Even when space became available down the line they kept it tight. New Zealand gave away three penalties as they repelled the women in white but there was no stopping Makua who powered over.

But was there an obstruction just before? They’re looking again. YES! Oh how cruel! Jacobs was standing just in front of the potential tackler and Ngxingolo essentially used her teammate as a shield.

Once they regroup they revert to their narrow approach before Janse van Rensburg floats one out to the right for Dolf. The fullback kicks ahead but gets too much on it.

It was so easy for NZ it was as if they were the ones calling the move. From there it went down the hands. Every pass was accurate until Holmes had it, running on an angle to score down the right.

That’s off the back of great interplay by women in black. They’ve looked a cut above this second half. SA have the line-out five out from their own line.

NZ on attack. SA on defence. Demant jinks around a tackler. Then Holmes does the same. From right to left and then back to the right. Woodman does well to keep the ball alive under contact in the right tram. Through the hands, Bayfield makes ground over the gainline but she’s isolated and picked off on the ground!

It seems as if they’ve run out of puff. NZ with the chance to strike off this set piece.

New Zealand 32-10 South Africa (Olsen-Baker, 55)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That is that, and fears of a cricket score are starting to materialise. </strong>It’s just so clinical from the world champions. It started with Bremner winning the kick upfield after it took a lucky bounce back towards her. Then it was a question of whether or not Joseph could spark the backline. She could with a zipping pass. Down the line to Waaka who off-loaded basketball-style back infield for the supporting Olsen-Baker who ran it towards the poles and dotted down. Finally, after five misses, Holmes slots the extras.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:39:19.915Z\">at 2.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c56f4a8f0880bae9c52ea2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:20:43.543Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>53 min: </strong>SA win a scrum penalty close to their own line then get the chance to scrum again a little further upfield. Ngwevu carries off first phase. Gwala does well under pressure. SA keep the ball but they struggle to punch holes. Mpupha has it in the tram shortly before NZ rip the ball away. A hack upfield takes a lucky bounce and Bremner gathers and in a flash NZ are back in SA’s 22.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56e808f0880bae9c52e9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:17:44.359Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>50 min: </strong>Four forwards come off the bench for South Africa. Charlie, Booi, Lochner and Hele make way. They were SA’s four best players in the first half. Their replacements need to scrum on halfway following a mistake at the restart. I fear that might be that for the Saffas. Woodman gets the ball and explodes down the right after linking with Sorensen-McGee. The veteran winger looks destined to reach the line after a 30 metre break but spills in contact about five metres short of the left corner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56df08f0880bae9c52e96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:15:15.701Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY! New Zealand 25-10 South Africa (Olsen-Baker, 47)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>New Zealand have put this game to bed in a flash! </strong>Their third try in just seven minutes. It started and ended with their no. 8 who brushed off three tacklers around the fringe to get things going. Then Joseph, off the back of a ruck, spotted acres of space in the backfield and landed a perfect box. Sorensen-McGee shot onto the bouncing ball and kept it alive. Seconds later Olsen-Baker was rumbling over from close range.</p> <p>Holmes has left her shooting boots at home. That’s her fifth miss off the tee.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56d4b8f086519d3271656\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:12:43.569Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY! New Zealand 20-10 South Africa (Sorensen-McGee, 45)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Black Ferns are on fire! </strong>They look a different team from the first half. Off a South African line-out back inside NZ’s patch, the Black ferns swiftly won a turnover. They snapped into gear and sent the ball from right to left. Woodman found Leti-I’iga who kept the move alive with a pass inside. Miller was on the ball and cantering upfield and it was her final pass to the flying youngster who received it on the gallop to score her eighth try of the World Cup.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56c738f086519d327164c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:08:54.017Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY! New Zealand 15-10 South Africa (Holmes, 41)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wow! What a start to the second half! </strong>Waaka rose high to win the kick-off and then it was just about speed of ball and accuracy off the breakdown. They kept the ball alive and kept chewing up metres. Ponsonby almost got there herself but was hauled down. They kept it alive, shifted it left at pace and Holmes, on the edge, had a simple run in to the corner. She dusted herself off to take the conversion but missed for the third time today. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56bfc8f0880bae9c52e80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:05:36.707Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Black Ferns are out early. </strong></p> <p>The Saffas have taken their time leaving the tunnel.

Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”</p> \n  <p>He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”</p> \n  <p>The problem for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a></strong> is that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.</p> \n  <p>They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts\">winter fuel duty</a></strong> decision, the freebies row and the handling of <strong>welfare cuts</strong> – have instead unleashed more chaos.</p> \n  <p>The most recent example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">sacking of </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">Peter Mandelson</a></strong>. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.</p> \n  <p>Then, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.</p> \n  <p>With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.</p> \n  <p>Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the <strong>NHS</strong>, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.</p> \n  <p>“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions. We’re doing lots of good stuff but it barely gets noticed. It just doesn’t hit the mark.”</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">Can Keir survive?

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> \n  <p>Blake said last week’s reshuffle saw a “narrowing” of representation of different parts of the party in ministerial positions:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People just felt that it was such a large reshuffle and, you know, people who were actually delivering in their posts were moved. And it just kind of felt like there was a real narrowing in who was sat around the table, and that can’t be positive, because I think there’s a sense that the leadership don’t like to be challenged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the No 10 operation, she said it was “really embarrassing” if Starmer was not told about Lord Mandelson’s emails to <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> soon enough, amid suggestions <strong>Downing Street</strong> was aware of the messages before the prime minister defended the ex-ambassador on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Blake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the back benches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> \n   <p>Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also said backbenchers are frustrated after a number of “own goals” for the government. Blake, the MP for <strong>Sheffield Hallam</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it is “frustrating” that the good work the government has done is “not cutting through” and added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Instead, we’ve had a number of kind of own goals, and that has meant that we’ve slipped heavily in the polls, and that we seem to be more interested in focusing on each other rather than what’s in the best interest of the country at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are some other key developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</strong>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Senior Labour MPs and the UK’s largest anti-fascist campaign group have called on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> to mount a more heartfelt defence of diversity and anti-racism.</strong> They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lucy Powell has called for a “change of culture” inside Starmer’s Downing Street to make it more inclusive and better connected to MPs</strong>, promising that as Labour’s deputy leader she would when needed deliver difficult truths to the prime minister. Speaking to the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/phillipson-and-powell-confirmed-as-final-contenders-in-labour-deputy-race\">after she secured</a> 117 MP nominations in the battle to replace Angela Rayner, Powell said a sequence of what she called “unforced errors” by the government had left many Labour MPs and members frustrated.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The bill to legalise assisted dying is a “licence to kill” that puts vulnerable people at risk, Theresa May has said</strong>, as the legislation was <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/sept-2025/assisted-dying-bill-considered-by-lords/\">debated in the House of Lords</a> for the first time. The former prime minister said she opposed the bill because she said people in England and Wales with disabilities, chronic illnesses or mental health conditions could feel under pressure to end their lives, and “because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others”.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:27:54.210Z\">at 9.27am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

Sweden’s Olympic champion Armand Duplantis was one of four athletes to be successful in every attempt.</p> <p>“It will definitely take 5.95m, I reckon, 5.90m might not get a medal, a bunch of guys are looking in really good shape,” he said. “I think 5.95m if not 6m.”</p> <p>In the morning session,<strong> </strong>Australia’s race walkers performed well in the 35km in<strong> </strong>stifling conditions, led by Rebecca Henderson who finished ninth behind women’s winner María Pérez from Spain.</p> <p>“I knew on my best day I could probably be around that eighth to 12th and that happened, so I’m really happy,” Henderson said.</p>    <p>Rhydian Cowley was best of the Australian men finishing in 11th, having overcome a hamstring injury that curtailed his preparations.</p> <p>Henderson and Cowley will race again in the 20km event in a week’s time.</p>",

In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c549378f0880bae9c52d8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:40:54.635Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ebere Eze</strong> makes his full Arsenal debut, replacing Gabriel Martinelli in one of three changes from the defeat at Arsenal. <strong>Martin Odegaard</strong> comes in for Declan Rice, who is rested, and <strong>Cristhian Mosquera</strong> covers for the injured William Saliba.</p> <p>Ange Postecoglou makes only one enforced change to the last Nottingham Forest XI selected by Nuno Espirito Santo. <strong>Morato</strong> comes in for the injured Ola Aina, which probably means a switch to right-back for Neco Williams.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-3-3)</strong> Raya; Timber, Mosquera, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Merino; Madueke, Gyokeres, Eze.<br><em>Subs: Kepa, White, Lewis-Skelly, Hincapie, Rice, Nwaneri, Dowman, Martinelli, Trossard.</em></p> <p><strong>Nottm Forest (4-2-3-1)</strong> Sels; Williams, Milenkovic, Murillo, Morato; Sangare, Anderson; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood.<br><em>Subs: Victor, Luiz, Kalimuendo, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee, Bakwa, Boly, Savona.</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Darren England.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2a1838f08671965418dbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:30:02.208Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Narrative is oxygen in modern football coverage, and we’ll all be gulping plenty of the good stuff this afternoon.

At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses cross the finish line.</p></li> </ul> <p>Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.</p> <p>Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.</p> <p>The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers. </p> <p>Black trainers are making their mark too.</p> <p>Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.</p></li> </ul> <p>Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.</p> <p>He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.</p> <p>A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.</p> <p>Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.</p>    <ul> <li><p>James Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.</p></li> </ul> <p>The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.</p> <p>K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.</p> <p>Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.</p> <p>During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.</p> <p>Now the situation is improving with more local participation.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Crowds in the grandstand before a race.</p></li> </ul> <p>The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.</p> <p>At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuota<strong> </strong>acknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.</p> <p>“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.</p> <p>The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.</p> <p>Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Faces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul> <p> Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.</p> <p>“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”</p> <p>The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.</p> <p>“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses gallop down the final straight in a race. </p></li> </ul> <p>The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.</p> <p>Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.</p> <p>“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>The slain head of Turning Point USA stoked campus culture wars and ‘treated faculty and students as enemies’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Charlie Kirk, the far-right activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">killed this week</a> while speaking at a campus event at Utah Valley University, never graduated from the community college he briefly attended. But his lack of a degree didn’t stop him from assuming a defining role in the ongoing transformation of US higher education.</p> <p>Kirk pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement’s ideological agenda.</p> <p>“Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education.</p> <p>Kirk’s murder at the age of 31 followed more than a decade of on-campus activism, which was characterized by his staunch bigotry and Christian nationalism; hundreds of often incendiary “debates” – his favored medium; and the 2012 establishment of Turning Point USA, a conservative powerhouse that calls itself, with more than 900 chapters, the nation’s largest youth movement. Starting from his parents’ garage in suburban Chicago, Kirk often boasted, the movement grew one viral attack line at a time, supercharged by social media’s conflict-rewarding algorithms.</p>    <p>Kirk wore his lack of a degree as a point of “pride”, he told California governor Gavin Newsom in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XJ6rQDRKGA\">podcast interview</a> earlier this year, and as ammunition for his characterizations of American campuses as elitist and out of touch.</p> <p>“I didn’t even graduate community college,” Kirk said. “I represent most of the country. Actually, still, the majority of the country does not have a college degree and if I may, you know, bluntly critique the Democratic party, you guys have become so college-credentialed and educated that you guys snobbishly look on the muscular class of this country.”</p> <p>While Kirk had in recent years moved from campus activist to the upper echelons of Republican politics and Trump’s inner circle, on university campuses he will mostly be remembered for his role galvanizing the so-called “culture wars” with his regular diatribes against diversity initiatives, immigration and minority groups. Kirk emboldened conservative students to turn on faculty and classmates, established a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/17/turning-point-usa-professor-watchlist\">professor watchlist</a>” for faculty it accused of spreading “leftist propaganda”, and embarked on an anti-woke crusade that has since become official government policy.</p>    <p>“Turning Point was not the first group to target professors, and of course attacking higher education is not new,” said Matthew Boedy, a professor of English at the University of North Georgia who has been studying the group and its founder after being targeted on its watchlist. “What Turning Point did was take the traditional, old ways of conservatives fighting the culture war and translated it into millennial speak.”</p> <p>Katie Gaddini, a history professor at Stanford University who studies US conservatism, recalled seeing Kirk speak at an event years ago, where he boasted that if given 15 minutes with any college student, he could “de-program years’ worth of indoctrination”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: ‘prowling Blacks’ and ‘the great replacement strategy’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“His whole mission, and Turning Point’s original mission, was what he called de-programming the woke indoctrination that he thought was taking place on college campuses,” she said. “And of course, we’re seeing the contestation over what can be taught in college campuses playing out on a macro, policy-level scale right now.”</p> <h2>Beyond the campus wars</h2> <p>If Kirk’s aggressive, often rude style and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">frequent forays</a> into explicit racism and sexism ruffled feathers with more traditional conservative groups on campus, he quickly surpassed them in relevance. Boedy recalled attending an event with Kirk and Black conservative activist Candace Owens, a TPUSA veteran who resigned from the organization in 2019 after making comments in which she appeared to defend Adolf Hitler. When a group of Black students raised their fists and walked out of the event in protest, Kirk and Owens mocked them and stirred the crowd to cheer them off. “It was emblematic,” said Boedy. “They’re in it for the culture war and that does mean warring against other people.”</p> <p>Hasan Piker, a leftwing political commentator who rose to prominence about the same time as Kirk and had been scheduled to debate him in two weeks at Dartmouth College, said that while Kirk wasn’t the first to debate speakers on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, “he was able to serialize this format better than other people, especially because he had a lot of institutional backing”.</p> <p>“He was a true operative,” Piker added, noting that his relationship with Kirk had been “cordial” even as their worldview was “diametrically opposite”. Still, he cautioned against interpreting Kirk’s predilection for debates as a sincere effort to engage in an argument.</p>    <p>“It’s being presented right now with this notion that everyone was doing these debates because they wanted to arrive at the truth,” said Hasan. “The ultimate purpose of these sorts of debate culture, focused video sequences, is not to actually arrive at some kind of hidden truth through discourse or the Socratic method, but more so to just ritualistically humiliate your interlocutors.”</p> <p>Kirk’s influence soon expanded well beyond campuses, said Boedy, whose <a href=\"https://www.wjkbooks.com/bookproduct/0664269214-the-seven-mountains-mandate/\">forthcoming book</a> examines Kirk’s mobilization efforts in churches, media and beyond. “Turning Point expanded beyond merely college campus wars. Kirk used the college campus wars as a springboard to talk about the larger national culture war,” Boedy added, noting that TPUSA now has more high school chapters than it has college ones, and that the group is also involved in canvassing for conservative candidates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-young-conservatives-social-media\">Virulent debater and clickbait savant: how Charlie Kirk pushed a new generation to the right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>TPUSA “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/democratic-influencers.html\">incubated</a>” more than 350 rightwing influencers over the years, the group said last year, and more recently Kirk had also taken his activism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/hellhole-uk-stolen-elections-south-korea-charlie-kirk-took-message-abroad\">abroad</a>, promoting Turning Point chapters in the UK and Australia. In May, Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/11/oxford-union-condemns-president-elects-reported-comments-on-charlie-kirk-shooting\">debated</a> the Oxford Union’s president-elect, and earlier this month he traveled to Japan and South Korea to spread his message before new audiences.</p> <p>Kirk successfully tapped into conservative students’ feelings that they had been persecuted on campus by intolerant liberals. Now, his killing risks turbocharging those grievances. “There is now proof in the minds of a lot of young conservatives that they are persecuted for their views on college campuses,” Gaddini said.</p> <p>As some brace for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-rightwing-media-reaction\">retribution</a> from the president, others warn that the chilling effect of the violence will be devastating for universities already battered by months of conflict and division.</p> <p>“This is a terrible day,” said Kamola, the Trinity professor. “Even if we disagree, the project of teaching and learning, and pursuing knowledge, is fundamentally threatened by violence.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was billed as the biggest game in Queensland ever: reigning AFL premiers Brisbane against their state rivals from down the M1. The long-derided Gold Coast had finally arrived as a force, winning an elimination final in an ecstatic finish over Fremantle, via a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/sep/08/afl-finals-gold-coast-suns-fremantle-dockers-david-swallow-nat-fyfe\">last-gasp point to retiring club great David Swallow</a>.</p> <p>For a short time, the semi-final looked like it might live up to its billing. And then it fell apart. The Suns barely fired a shot after half-time, overpowered by a manic Lions side desperate to atone after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">humiliated by Geelong</a> in Melbourne last week. Brisbane now face Collingwood in a preliminary final at the MCG on Saturday. Gold Coast are done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">Brisbane Lions roar into AFL preliminary final with statement win over Gold Coast Suns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Suns could hardly have started better. Ben King plucked a pack mark and kicked the first goal for a confidence boost after a poor first final. Matt Rowell tore through the next stoppage and his captain, and best mate, Noah Anderson, streamed in on the run for another. Shortly after, Rowell burst through another pack and King had his next opportunity.</p> <p>King matched up on Darcy Gardiner, a gamble on the part of Lions coach Chris Fagan as he tried to free up Harris Andrews in defence. A third mark and second goal to the Suns spearhead ensured the move was short-lived. Andrews went to King, and from there the Suns forward was barely sighted. Too often, he has no impact on a contest when he can’t get the ball himself.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>For a quarter and a half, the game went back and forth at a furious clip. Both sides were aggressive in their ball use. At half-back, Lions veteran Dayne Zorko sent low, scudding passes forward, scything through the Suns’ defence. Charlie Cameron and Cam Rayner, both of whom were poor against the Cats, roamed higher upfield, asking more questions of their opponents.</p> <p>After Andrews had taken King out of the equation, two players separated the contest. The first was Josh Dunkley, who tackled the Suns – and Rowell in particular – into submission. He laid 12 in the first half and finished with 18, a finals record. He gained a mere 62m for his side, but he cost the Suns a mile in return.</p>    <p>The other was Will Ashcroft. This was, it’s worth pointing out, just his 56th game, but last year’s Norm Smith medallist is already established as a rare finals performer. One of the few who could hold his head up in last week’s drubbing, Ashcroft split the game apart in the second quarter with his run, creativity and class.</p> <p>By the end of the first half, the Suns were losing their composure. A foolish 50m penalty a minute short of half-time ended with Zac Bailey in a full 5m of space at the fall of the ball. The margin was out to 25 points at the break. That’s nothing in today’s football, but the game already felt done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/ruthless-hawks-crush-lacklustre-crows-to-secure-preliminary-final-spot\">Ruthless Hawthorn crush lacklustre Adelaide to secure AFL preliminary final spot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were only sideshows after half-time, like the sight of Kai Lohmann rubbing his newly shorn dome for luck after losing his surfie blond locks during the week. There was also the sad sight of Swallow – the Suns’ last original recruit, and first pick in the 2010 draft – trotting around in his final game, his body broken by its relentless demands.</p> <p>Is there another player in the game who has shown such loyalty for as little team success as Swallow? I’m struggling to think of one. He’s been spare parts this year, used as the substitute in six of his nine games. But more than anyone over the journey, he’s shown the way for this club. Now they have to go on without him.</p>",

There was a lack of polish in the forward line when it came to finishing off some moves, so that’s the main area that Brisbane need to fix up.</p> <p>As for Gold Coast, this is clearly their best season after being the punching bags of the comp for so long. It’s really not surprising that they were flat, after making the longest trip in football the previous week, Brisbane to Perth, and not just that but beating Fremantle, winning their first final, and doing it in the dying seconds of the game. That’s a huge emotional experience to process.

His shot from deep in the pocket, 45 out, misses to the near side.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:15:58.863Z\">at 11.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c540108f084b3c85a4e0a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:03:15.603Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q1: 3 mins remaining: Brisbane 3.4.22 – Gold Coast 3.3.21</strong></p> <p>Ty Gallop marks but misses his set shot, then another Lions point is bashed through, but Gold Coast rush to the other end in a good passage of play, Rowell and Anderson involved heavily, only to see the forward-pocket mark dropped in a good spot.

After an arm wrestle until halfway through the second quarter, Brisbane got blitzed by three-quarter time. And in the process they lost their star Lachie Neale with a calf injury.

Yes, we always said that this state was the true home of Australian rules football, and tonight is the night that proves it. On reflection, it would actually be better if these clubs were on opposite sides of the draw so they could end up in the first all-Queensland grand final, but we’ll settle for a dual-knockout final to see who goes into the prelim final against Collingwood at the MCG.</p> <p>Brisbane and Gold Coast matches have not, let’s be honest, had much riding on them for most of their history given that at least one and often both clubs have been down the wrong end of the ladder. But now the Lions are reigning premiers, and the Suns, after so many years of being belted around the league, are not only playing finals for the first time, but won their first ever knockout despite taking the lead with nine seconds to go.</p> <p>It was fun. Tonight could be even more so.

What did they mean?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Investigators who found a bolt-action rifle near the site where Charlie Kirk was shot on a Utah campus said that they also found casings scrawled with messages.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, a 22-year-old college student was reported to have confessed to his family that he had shot and killed Kirk earlier this week. Robinson was arrested after his father recognised him in photos and video footage police released of the shooter escaping the scene.</p> \n  <p>One of the casings read, <strong>“hey fascist! CATCH! (up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols),”</strong>, according to an affadavit filed on Friday in a Utah court.</p> \n  <p>The arrows were most likely a reference to the popular video game Helldivers 2 and its sequence of controller moves to unleash a powerful bomb, according to an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">analysis </a>published by the New York Times.</p> \n  <p>Much of the other casings had similar messages steeped in video game references and allusions to different internet subcultures.</p> \n  <p>One of the messages, <strong>“Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,”</strong> is often used to mock participants in online role-play communities, namely furries. Another message said, <strong>“If you read This, you are GAY Lmao,”</strong> its tone suggestive of the kind of humour found on internet messaging boards.</p> \n  <p>Another casing read, <strong>“O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!,”</strong> likely a reference to the popular Italian folk song “Bella Ciao.” Popularised as an antifascist anthem in Italy after the second world war, it resurfaced globally in recent years because of its inclusion in the hit Netflix series “Money Heist” and in video games, including the first-person shooter game Far Cry 6.</p> \n  <p>The casing messages, like Robinson’s political ideology, are difficult to parse. The NYT has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">reported</a> that Robinson registered to vote in Utah, but is not affiliated with a political party and had never voted in an election, according to the Washington County Clerk.</p> \n  <p>His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c5627b8f084b3c85a4e1ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:25:26.026Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> on Friday “don’t even bother dealing with” the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare\">healthcare</a> priorities.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress\">Congress</a> is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives\">House of Representatives</a> have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.</p> \n  <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.</p> \n  <p>“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”</p> \n  <p>The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump\">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> Republicans passed in July.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c55d0f8f0880bae9c52e13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:16:46.019Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>What a swell party it was.

Donald Trump Jr danced to YMCA while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NujJmSMi49k\">JD Vance quipped</a>: “They don’t tell you when you run for vice-president that you get brought on stage with the Village People.”</p> \n  <p>Guests at the $15,000-a-head <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/editorial-images/news/event/turning-point-inaugural-eve-ball-held-in-washington-d-c/776267713\">Turning Point Inaugural Eve Ball</a> last January included future FBI director Kash Patel, Jeanine Pirro and the Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor. But towering above them all, literally and figuratively, was Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and key enabler of the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> \n  <p>Kirk, a 31-year-old rightwing activist, podcaster and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was killed on Wednesday</a> by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/13/womens-suffrage-week-in-patriarchy",
    "description": "<p>The country’s finest male intellectuals – including some in positions of power – are weighing in on the matter </p>",
    "content": "<p>Should women in the US have the right to vote? You’d be forgiven for assuming this particular issue was sorted out quite a long time ago. But, because we live in hell, it seems the question is once again up for debate.</p> <p>Not by women, though; the fairer sex is obviously too emotional for such muscular discussion. So please sit this one out, ladies, and listen to what America’s finest male intellectuals have to say.</p> <p>First up is Braeden Sorbo, a 24-year-old conservative influencer and nepo baby (he’s the son of the Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo), who claims he is constantly harangued by women telling him how desperate they are to have their rights taken away.</p> <p>“I know more young women today who say they wish they didn’t ever get the right to vote than I’ve ever talked to in my life,” Sorbo <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/women-should-not-be-allowed-to-vote-conservative-influencer-braeden-sorbo-says/\">recently told</a> Richard Harris, host of the Truth &amp; Liberty<em> </em>YouTube show. Which rather raises the question: how many young women has Sorbo ever talked to in his life? Harris didn’t push Sorbo on the veracity of this anecdata, however. Instead he just gave a manly chuckle as Sorbo blamed all the ills of the world (abortion, feminism) on the 19th amendment.</p> <p>Per Sorbo, his female peers have also told him that “I would much rather give up my one right to vote if it meant 10,000 liberal women wouldn’t be allowed to vote, so that we could return to a better place”. (<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/many-such-cases\">Many</a> such cases!) He went on to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/kevin-sorbo-son-women-vote-b2823946.html\">say</a> that his ultimate vision is a “voting system based on Christian morals, which relates to married couples having one joint vote”.</p> <p>Perhaps you’re thinking: what does it matter what a 24-year-old jamoke on a far-right YouTube show says? I refer you to line three of paragraph one: it matters because we live in hell. In a normal world, Sorbo would be a fringe figure shouting into the ether who we could all happily ignore. But thanks in part to digital media, we don’t have that luxury any more. Sorbo has 1.9 million followers <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@braedensorbo?lang=en\">on TikTok</a>.; while some of his videos only get a few thousand views he has quite a few that top a million. </p> <p>More importantly, however, Sorbo’s views can no longer be dismissed as “fringe”. Rather, the idea that women shouldn’t vote is increasingly being co-signed and amplified by some of the most powerful people in America.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the US defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth\">Pete Hegseth</a>, shared a video on X in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/pete-hegseth-video-pastors-women-voting\">several pastors</a> say women should no longer be allowed to vote as individuals. “In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” one of the pastors in the <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1953626931234054558\">CNN clip</a> says. “I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.” While Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the video, he did retweet it with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life.”</p> <p>Slate then <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-women-voting-christian-nationa\">contacted</a> the Pentagon to give Hegseth a chance to clarify his thoughts on the matter. The reply wasn’t a straight answer; instead it just said Hegseth was a member of a church affiliated with Pastor Doug Wilson and “very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings”. Wilson is a Christian nationalist <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/women-rule/2025/08/15/christian-nationalists-target-womens-right-to-vote-00511090\">who has said</a> “women are the kind of people that people come out of” and written blogposts with titles such as “<a href=\"https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/s7-engaging-the-culture/the-lost-virtue-of-sexism.html\">The Lost Virtue of Sexism</a>”.</p> <p>Then there’s the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/19/jd-vance-trump-vp-pick-silicon-valley\">bankroll</a> JD Vance’s political career. Back in 2009, Thiel <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">published an essay </a>that argued it may have been a bit of an error to give women the right to vote. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” Thiel wrote.</p> <p>Thiel got a lot of flak for this and later <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-women-democracy_n_5747079be4b03ede4413f6f5\">clarified his statement</a>, saying: “It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away … While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.” Which is rather different from saying: “Of course women should have the right to vote, I’m mortified anyone misinterpreted my pretentious word salad.”</p> <p>Predictably, Elon Musk also has some views on this matter. While the tech billionaire (soon to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/elon-musk-trillion-dollar-pay-deal-tesla\">trillionaire</a>?) has never explicitly argued women shouldn’t vote, he has amplified tweets that undermine the idea of universal suffrage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/07/elon-musk-women-testosterone\">Last year</a>, for example, he wrote “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830390502836854925\">interesting observation</a>” on a retweet of a post by an account called Autism Capital which stated a “Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The same post argued “women and low T men” are “malleable” and can’t think freely. A year before, Musk appeared to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/elon-musk-children-voting-rights-b2369096.html\">endorse the idea</a> that “democracy is probably unworkable long term without limiting suffrage to parents”.</p> <p>The right are very good at shifting the Overton window <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/06/alt-right-politics-2016-andrew-marantz-antisocial-review\">in their favour</a> and propelling once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/anti-abortion-fetal-personhood\">fringe views</a> into the mainstream. They’re also adept at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/first-amendment-conservatives-supreme-court.html\">weaponizing</a> the law to help advance their agenda. They won’t be able to get rid of women’s voting rights overnight, of course. Just like the right to a legal abortion, they’ll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/31/congress-republicans-save-act-voting-rights\">chip away at it</a> gradually with bills that disenfranchise the “wrong” sort of people and <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/the-19th-amendment-is-under-attack-and-not-every-woman-has-an-equal-right-to-vote/\">mechanisms</a> that make voting more difficult. But we should not mistake their ultimate objective. Musk, Thiel and Hegseth are some of the most powerful people in the world: when they, along with influencers such as Sorbo, hint that they are interested in getting rid of women’s suffrage, we should take them very seriously indeed.</p> <p><strong>Texas professor fired after accusations of teaching ‘illegal’ gender identity<br></strong>Texas A&amp;M University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired\">fired a professor</a> on Tuesday after a viral video in which a student complained they were being taught illegal notions about gender identity.

    "description": "<p>As the rock band played the final stop of their sold-out reunion tour near LA, it was clear: Liam and Noel Gallagher have become icons stateside</p>",
    "content": "<p>After a crowd of nearly 90,000 finished singing Don’t Look Back in Anger, Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher had a question.</p> <p>“Are we dating?” he asked fans at the Rose Bowl, a stadium just outside Los Angeles, last Sunday night. “America, Oasis, the new hot couple, yeah?”</p> <p>If the Gallagher brothers and the United States are going steady, it comes after three decades of a turbulent, on-again, off-again relationship. But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear: Oasis has finally taken over America.</p>    <p>In the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes about <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOOr1l6j7fS/?hl=en\">newly minted Anglophiles</a> and joke <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWaoYxiazp/?hl=en\">T-shirts </a>saying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline in <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/oasis-rose-bowl-stadium-concert-tour-britannia-1236512226/\">Variety read</a>: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”</p> <p>That all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the band <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">has sold 7 million albums here</a>. But by comparison, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080058/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7511240/ask-billboard-rihannas-quirky-record-in-the-hot-100s-top-10-with\">Nirvana has sold more than 27 million</a> in the US; even Gin Blossoms <a href=\"https://www.ginblossoms.net/bio\">have sold 10 million</a>, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.</p> <p>“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam later <a href=\"https://lithub.com/shitholes-usa-noel-and-liam-gallagher-on-when-oasis-toured-america/\">said of the US</a>. It was a matter of contrast, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">New York Times</a> pointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.</p> <p>But in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience</p> <footer> <cite>an Oasis fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.</p> <p>The mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”</p>    <p>But LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, told <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/out-crystal-meth-tour-1994-1235088975/\">Rolling Stone</a>. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/oasis-reunion-melissa-lim-19730919.php\">San Francisco Chronicle in 2016</a>. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOTten1j3E0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">posted on Instagram</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/22/why-britpop-nostalgia-just-wont-go-away-robbie-williams-blur-oasis\">Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/opinion/oasis-tour-america.html\">Lizzy Goodman</a> points to the Gallagher brothers’ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-online-fights.html\">unfiltered, brash</a> personas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">timeless</a>, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.</p> <p>The US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”</p> <p>Maybe we finally have.</p>",

The only thing that could have potentially saved Charlie Kirk from getting shot in the neck was reasonable gun control.”</p> <p>Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of a book on the second amendment right to bear arms, Gunfight, told the Guardian that Americans had shown a stubborn resistance to gun safety reform through equally terrible shooting incidents in the past. They include horrors such as the killing of 20 elementary school children in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/newtown-shooting-gunman-kills-20-children\">Newtown, Connecticut</a>, in 2012, and the mass murder of 60 people five years later at a music festival in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives\">Las Vegas</a>.</p> <p>“People’s positions on the second amendment and gun policy have really hardened in recent years,” Winkler said. “It seems like Americans are impervious to shooting-based reforms, we’re just not seeing this. I don’t think this week’s tragedies are likely to shift the substance of the debate or the current stalemate on guns.”</p> <p>Kirk had been discussing gun violence at the moment that he was shot. Sitting on a sparkling cloudless day in the shade of a tent bearing the logo of his “American Comeback Tour”, the Turning Point USA leader was sparring by microphone with students over how many mass shooters in the past decade had been transgender.</p> <p>“Too many,” he said. (In fact, trans people have carried out a tiny fraction of mass shootings, the fact-checking group <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/09/trans-people-mass-shootings-gun-violence/\">Politifact</a> found.)</p> <p>Kirk’s own views on guns in America were reflective of the prevailing attitude across the Maga universe which is fiercely protective of the second amendment despite the evident side-effects of such devotion. Kirk being Kirk – his willingness to confront his detractors face to face was summed up in his slogan “Prove me wrong” – he articulated his passion for gun rights in brutally frank terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it’s worth it to have a cost of … some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Kirk</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a speech in Salt Lake City two years ago that has been widely resurfaced on social media in the wake of his death, Kirk argued that the benefits of having guns in many American hands outweighed the costs. Gun deaths were inevitable in such a heavily armed society, he admitted, but the prevalence of firearms allowed citizens to “defend yourself against a tyrannical government”.</p> <p>“I think it’s worth it,” he said. “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It’s rational.”</p> <p>Kirk went on to repeat the mantra that the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA) touted in the wake of the Newtown tragedy – the solution to gun violence is more guns. “If our money and our sporting events and our airplanes have armed guards, why don’t our children?”</p>    <p>Such a hardline pro-gun posture has been echoed by Trump. In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, in the early stages of his first term in the White House, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-endorsees-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-more-weapons\">Trump backed</a> raising the age of gun possession to 21, and even lent his name to comprehensive background checks which have long been a central demand of gun control advocates.</p> <p>It is not clear what made him change his mind – was it pressure from the NRA or from his own supporters? – but he quickly and quietly backed off the idea. The only change in gun policy in the second Trump administration has been in the direction of loosening regulations – his recent mega finance bill removed taxes from short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, and he has instructed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to aggressively <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/02/trump-gun-policy-executive-order-biden/\">roll back</a> measures to reduce gun violence introduced by his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Kirk assassination, Trump has signaled that he will be guided not by a desire to get to the root of the problem but by a desire for vengeance. He has <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115182892535295750\">blamed the shooting</a> on the “radical left”, disregarding recent atrocities against Democrats including the June shooting of Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-killings-melissa-hortman\">Minnesota lawmakers</a> in which one was killed.</p> <p>In a statement from the Oval Office, Trump has insinuated that he intends to crack down on leftist civil society organisations. There has so far been no talk of similarly cracking down on guns.</p> <p>“There’s just no way that Trump is going to support gun reform,” Winkler said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the bedrock causes of America’s unique struggle with gun violence goes untouched. An analysis by <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\">the Trace</a>, a news outlet reporting on the issue, estimates that there are almost 400m guns in circulation in the US – that’s more than the number of people living in the country.</p> <p>More than four in 10 Americans live in households with a gun, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/24/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">Pew Research Center</a>. Though there is a partisan political divide in ownership, with 45% of Republicans owning a gun, that still leaves one in five Democrats also holding deadly weapons.</p> <p>As the number of guns has risen, so too have gun deaths. Almost 47,000 people died by the gun in the US in 2023, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has produced official figures. That’s the third-highest year on record, after a pandemic-induced spike in the previous two years.</p>    <p>The argument frequently proffered by second amendment lobbyists that this is just the way it is can easily be squelched by comparison with other rich countries. A 2016 CDC study <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/05/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-us/#how-does-the-gun-death-rate-in-the-u-s-compare-with-other-countries\">cited by Pew</a> put the US gun death rate at 10.6 per 100,000 people – more than five times the rate in Canada (2.1 per 100,000), and almost 20 times that of Spain (0.6).</p> <p>Such alarming statistics are set against a powerful subculture in which the gun manufacturing industry and pro-gun groups and magazines actively promote the allure of the sniper. “Best civilian sniper rifles”, was the headline from <a href=\"https://gunmagwarehouse.com/blog/best-civilian-sniper-rifles/\">GunMag Warehouse</a>.</p> <p>The online site <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/guns/best-sniper-rifles/\">Outdoor Life</a> ran a feature on 16 of the “best sniper rifles”, defining the weapon broadly as the one that is “most capable of fulfilling the mission that whoever is carrying it is tasked with”. The author emphasised the huge variety of environments in which the sniper rifle has to operate, including “crowded cities”.</p> <p>First on the list was the AI AXSR which was praised for its “toughness, innovation, and accuracy”. The weapon <a href=\"https://www.milehighshooting.com/accuracy-international-axsr-338-lapua-mag-27-dark-earth/\">trades to civilians for $11,000</a> on online firearms sites.</p> <p>The gun that delivered the single shot that ended Kirk’s life has been described by US investigators as a Mauser high-powered bolt-action rifle. Though it was not a purpose-built sniper rifle it was precise enough to allow the killer to strike from a rooftop about 160 metres away from his target.</p> <p>Josh Sugarmann, executive of the Violence Policy Center which has tracked the proliferation of the sniper subculture, sees its growth as part of the increasing militarization of the gun industry and its civilian offerings. “No one notices or seems to care that there is an industry actively designing and building the weapons that enable shooters to more effectively commit assassinations and mass shootings,” he said.</p> <p>“The gun industry is designing, building and promoting rifles that are effective at much longer range with the goal of ‘one shot, one kill’.”</p>",

    "title": "When Mandelson met Maga: how Labour lord charmed Trump’s inner circle",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/13/peter-mandelson-maga-labour-lord-charmed-donald-trump-inner-circle",
    "description": "<p>Peter Mandelson was effective if controversial choice as ambassador before all went wrong ‘at worst possible time’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Peter Mandelson was in his element. Lounging on a sofa one June evening at Butterworth’s, a bistro serving as the gastronomical centre of the Maga movement in Washington DC, the recently appointed British ambassador was being honoured with a plaque that indicated he was easing his way into the conservative circles around Donald Trump.</p> <p>The appointment of Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair’s New Labour project in the 1990s, had not been without controversy. He was the first political ambassador to the United States in almost half a century and had twice resigned from Labour governments in the past over scandals (not to mention his past association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein).</p> <p>So he would have to move quickly to replace the well-sourced expertise of his predecessor and build ties with a new administration that had upended all the rules of the traditional Washington establishment.</p> <p>Mandelson managed that by leaning into the heady conservative politics surrounding the US president, working old contacts in Trump’s circles of businessmen and courting the new media right. Surrounded by conservative journalists that evening, he said that, while the two leaders’ politics may differ, both Trump and UK prime minister Keir Starmer were riding the same political winds of upheaval.</p> <p>Both had received mandates, he said that evening <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/trump-mandelson-trumpworld-plaque-vrmjrqcl2\">according to British media reports in the Times</a>, from “angry people who felt they were being unheard by mainstream politics” and were “angry about the cost of living, angry about uncontrolled immigration and angry about uncontrolled woke culture spreading across institutions”.</p> <p>It was a textbook performance for the once-dubbed “Prince of Darkness” who was testing the lines between ambassadorial deference and open flattery. In public, a favourite adjective for Trump was neutral but weighty: “consequential”. In private, he tended away from criticism of the new administration, even as the White House leaned toward Vladimir Putin and flirted with authoritarian measures at home.</p> <p>His firing now amid new details of the Epstein scandal – one that the Trump administration has sought to outrun – plays out just days before Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, when Starmer must seek to influence Trump over the war in Ukraine, continue negotiations over a US-UK trade deal, deflect concern over a potential UK recognition of Palestine, and more.</p> <p>“[Mandelson] has his own independent stature and status, and that was a good thing, but it carried risks, and now it’s gone wrong,” said Alexandra Hall Hall, a former British diplomat who resigned while serving as lead envoy for Brexit in the US in 2019. “And now it’s gone wrong on the worst possible topic at the worst possible time.”</p> <p>In Washington, the British ambassador’s Edwin Lutyens-designed residence, where Mandelson lived with his partner and “diplo-dog” Jock, hosted parties that saw an influx of the new conservative media elite in Washington. At a White House Correspondents’ Dinner co-hosted by the Daily Mail in June, new media influencers like Natalie Winters, seen as a protege of the rightwing firebrand Steve Bannon, rubbed shoulders with established journalists from across the media spectrum. It reflected the White House’s own inclusion of conservative bloggers among accredited correspondents as a counterweight to a perceived liberal bias among the media.</p> <p>At a celebration for King Charles’s birthday that month, Mandelson wryly inserted jokes about Trump as guests mingled among cigar and whiskey stations, drawing laughs as he recognised a leader “associated with grand ceremonies and golden aesthetics. So happy birthday, President Trump”.</p> <p>It is precisely what Mandelson was sent to Washington DC to do: charm the Maga faithful around Trump while bringing the political heft that would allow a UK envoy to negotiate in the name of the prime minister.</p> <p>He replaced Dame Karen Pierce, a veteran diplomat who was already a regular at Mar-a-Lago and one of the best-sourced foreign ambassadors in Trumpworld. Some, like Bannon, had rejected Mandelson as a “terrible choice” because of his past remarks about Trump and links to establishment politics in the UK.</p> <p>Yet Mandelson proved the doubters wrong, as at least one conservative outlet put it. His main success was the outlines of a US-UK trade deal, which was feted at an Oval Office meeting with Trump where Mandelson was complimented by Trump for his “beautiful accent” and given the floor in a rare show of deference to a foreign ambassador.</p> <p>The White House team around him laughed as he described Trump’s “typical 11th-hour intervention by you with your phone call demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected”. He then channelled Winston Churchill as he added: “For us it is not the end, it’s the end of the beginning.”</p> <p>His absence will be noted as Trump arrives in the United Kingdom for the controversial state visit that Mandelson’s quick-found relationship with the US president could have helped to smooth.</p> <p>After the Oval Office meeting with Trump, Mandelson left with a souvenir – a handwritten note in Trump’s distinctive marker scrawl and unmistakeable signature.</p> <p>“Peter,” it read. “Great Job!”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by Tommy Robinson to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p> \n<p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central London, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> \n<p>Other planned speakers on Saturday include Ant Middleton, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for Germany’s far-right AfD party and a far-right Polish MEP.</p> \n<p>Other Americans making the trip include Joey Mannarino, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump. </p> \n<p>However, there are doubts about whether one of the most high-profile speakers, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior Jordan Peterson, will appear.</p> \n<p>While he is listed in the lineup and has been a supporter of Robinson online, he has made no mention of the event recently. His appearance would also pose questions about his continued association with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists\">Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC)</a>, a yearly gathering in London involving businesses and conservatives that has included the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK.</p> \n<p>A pause on any new leave being booked has been imposed by police, who have had to contend with violence on the fringes of previous events involving Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.</p> \n<p>In a video to supporters on Thursday about the Kirk shooting, Robinson talked about “the bastard who has murdered him, or the organisation, the corporation or the government it is that has killed him”.</p> \n<p>A 22-year-old man, identified as Tyler Robinson by Spencer Cox, governor of Utah, was later arrested as a suspect in the fatal shooting.</p> \n<p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p> \n<p>The Stand Up to Racism march to a rally at Whitehall will be led by a Women Against the Far Right contingent including the MPs Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.</p> \n<p>“The far right are a menace to the whole of society. Their first targets, asylum seekers and Muslims, are broadening to all migrants, black people and on to trade unionists, all religious minorities and anti-racists,” said Abbott.</p> \n<p>Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: “This is going to be big, but we are also talking about movement to the right of Reform UK and we still don’t know where it is going.”</p> \n<p>Robinson also recently said he had joined Advance UK, a party set up by former senior figures in Reform UK, including Ben Habib, which will itself be formally launched next month.</p> \n<p>Robinson has increasingly pivoted towards an outwardly Christian nationalist position, particularly after his release from his latest prison sentence. Christian nationalists will be among the crowd, but a large section are expected to be drawn from the ranks of those who have taken part in the recent wave of protests outside asylum-seeker accommodation.</p> \n<p>As with other Robinson events, the core of support is also expected to come from a network of football fan and hooligan firms that are also involved in the English Defence League (EDL).</p> \n<p>Lowles posed the question: “What does this rally signify politically? One scenario is that people will coalesce around Tommy Robinson and Advance UK, but it will require him to step up.”</p> \n<p>“A lot of what he does is about himself and he’s been engaged in a huge amount of merchandising for this event, as well as constant appeals for money towards a goal of about £300,000. What will he do with it? Advance UK need him more than he needs them, but equally this could become part of his fight with Farage.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police has been engaged in discussions with Robinson before the event. The force does not give permission for protests but requires advance notice of a procession to allow for appropriate planning.</p> \n<p>A Met spokesperson said: “Saturday will be a busy day in London and officers will be on duty in significant numbers to keep people safe.”</p> \n<p>The force said Muslim Londoners should not change their plans in light of the rally.</p> \n<p>Commander Clair Haynes, who is in charge of the public order policing operation in London this weekend, said: “We recognise that there are particular concerns for many in London’s Muslim communities ahead of the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest given the record of anti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents of offensive chanting by a minority at previous marches.</p> \n<p>“There have been some suggestions that Muslim Londoners should change their behaviour this Saturday, including not coming into town. That is not our advice.</p> \n<p>“Everyone should be able to feel safe travelling into and around London.”</p> \n<p>As well as Robinson’s rally, which is styled as a “free speech festival” and will take place at the southern end of Whitehall after a march from Waterloo, the counter-protest by Stand Up to Racism will take place at the northern end of Whitehall, after a march from Russell Square.</p> \n<p>“There are a number of other events taking place on the same day, including multiple football fixtures, which will all form part of the policing operation,” the Met spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Duo are the most productive T20 openers, with Salt’s goal to be ‘best in the world’ after record innings against South Africa</p>",
    "content": "<p>As he reflected on his epic individual contribution to a thrilling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">historic win for England</a> against South Africa on Friday, Phil Salt spoke about being inspired to ever greater heights by the people around him. “The mentality that we’ve had from when I started playing for England to now, we’re always trying to push things forward,” he said. “Always trying to take, you know, the next step in the game.”</p> <p>But over the past few years most of the steps taken by the white-ball side have been backwards. It is the Test team under Ben Stokes that have produced the thrills, while in shorter formats there has been a succession of spills. Jos Buttler, by general acclamation England’s greatest short-format player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/28/jos-buttler-steps-down-as-captain-of-englands-white-ball-cricket-team\">stood down as captain</a> in February after three years that started with victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup but came to be characterised by failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">Records tumble as Phil Salt’s stunning ton leads England to T20 rout of South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buttler, however, is now adding fresh gloss to his reputation and in the past week has looked in brilliant touch in scoring a 32-ball 62 in England’s one-day international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">romp against South Africa</a> in Southampton, being the only English batter to flourish in the abbreviated five-over thrashfest that launched the T20 series in Cardiff, and again at Old Trafford on Friday night, where he and Salt joyfully and emphatically reclaimed the opening berths.</p> <p>With Salt on paternity leave and Buttler at No 3, Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett opened during the T20 series against West Indies in June. But, with a breathless summer behind them and a hectic winter ahead, both were rested for these games and in their absence Salt and Buttler have reunited to make the idea of picking anyone else appear absurd.</p> <p>That Buttler dominates the list of England’s most-successful T20 opening partnerships is no surprise, but the fact he and Salt have been so productive as a pairing perhaps is. In 17 innings they have scored 967 runs, one short of the total Buttler and Jason Roy accumulated in 31, at an average of 60.43.</p> <p>Of all opening pairings with at least 15 outings over the past decade, none comes close to matching them, the only other couple averaging above 47 being Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz on 53.86. No other representatives of Test-playing nations get within sniffing distance of their run rate of 10.52.</p> <p>“We bounce off each other well,” Salt said. “We’ve got pretty set roles – it’s my job to get us off to as good a start as possible and give Jos the opportunity to take a couple of balls, because when he does he goes on and gets a match-winning score a lot of the time. We don’t often need to communicate. When he needs to get me on [strike], it just happens. And when I need to get him on. There’s no ego or anything like that, we just do it, and that’s a massive part of having a good opening partnership.”</p>    <p>Salt produced England’s highest T20 score with an unbeaten 141 on Friday, his fourth century in the format (Buttler has one, in more than three times as many innings). But there are many ways the former captain has assisted Salt’s success. The way they work together at the crease is the most obvious, but Buttler was also the inspiration and the challenge that pushed Salt to focus in particular on attacking the first over, something he now does better than any batter in the world.</p> <p>“In order to knock a man out of possession, you need to do something they can’t do,” Salt said. “I thought: ‘Right, if I can be the most dangerous in the first six, 10, 15 balls of the game, that’s quite a unique tool.’ I’m someone who’s always looking at ways to get better. The goal is to be right up there. I want to be the best in the world at this.”</p> <p>Perhaps England can rationally nurse that same goal, with another World Cup to be played in India and Sri Lanka in February. But first comes Sunday’s series decider at Trent Bridge and the challenge of proving that Friday was more than a glorious anomaly.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence is changing how students learn and the world they’ll graduate into. Experts reveal how applicants can get ahead</p>",
    "content": "<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”</p> <p>Altman, whose company developed and released ChatGPT in November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.</p> <p>Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.</p> <p>For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in&nbsp;many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.</p> <p>“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”</p> <p>His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”</p> <p>Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.</p> <p>He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.</p> <p>“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”</p> <p>There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”</p> <p>Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.</p> <p>“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”</p> <p>For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.</p> <p>He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.” </p> <p>Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.</p> <p>Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”</p> <p>Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”</p> <p>In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.</p> <p>“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Just seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and features the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.</p> \n<p>Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/brighton-owner-tony-bloom-nets-another-winner-with-santorini-star-at-doncaster-horse-racing\">Brighton owner Tony Bloom nets another winner with Santorini Star at Doncaster</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.</p> \n<p>All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.</p> \n<p>He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip. Scandinavia and Carmers will offer strong opposition, but <strong>Lambourn (3.40)</strong> has been edging ever close to the top of the betting in recent days and still looks fairly priced at about 5-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76eabbec-cd0a-4d04-9a3e-338198e48c4b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster </b>1.15 Treble Tee 2.50 Gewan 2.25 Apollo One (nap) 3.00 Shadow Of Light 3.40 Lambourn 4.15 Mr Wonka 4.50 Fantasy Believer</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield </b>1.25 One Million Dreams 1.58 Beccadelli 2.33 Rogue Dynasty 3.13 Kingsclere 3.55 Summertime Blues 4.30 Parish Councillor 5.00 Clearpoint</p>\n    <p><b>Chester </b>1.35 Wild Dahlia 2.05 Military Academy 2.40 Ndaawi (nb) 3.23 Hanney Girl 4.00 Glistening Nights 4.35 Giant 5.05 Heathen 5.35 Sir Edward Lear</p>\n    <p><b>Bath </b>3.28 Somebodycomegether 4.05 Cloudbuster 4.40 Under Curfew 5.10 Goodwood Mogul 5.40 Tamzan 6.13 Baynoona 6.45 Blue Point Express 7.15 Mrs Meader</p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh </b>4.10 Martin’s Brig 4.45 Welbury 5.18 Straight Ahead 5.50 Penn Avenue 6.22 Maghlaak 6.52 Red Mirage 7.22 Sixcor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.15</strong> Easier ground could be what <strong>Treble Tee</strong> needs to return to winning form after excellent efforts in defeat on his last two starts.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.50</strong> <strong>Gewan </strong>showed a good attitude to maintain his unbeaten record at York last month and is narrowly preferred to Oxagon, a wide-margin winner last time out.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.05</strong> There is little to choose between Hamish, the warm favourite, and <strong>Military Academy</strong> on their form at Goodwood in June, so a 3lb swing in favour of John &amp; Thady Gosden’s gelding makes him a logical pick at the likely odds.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 2.25</strong> <strong>Apollo One </strong>has been operating below his best so far this season but he was an unlucky loser of this race 12 months ago, behind a subsequent Group One winner in American Affair, and is 1lb lower in the ratings this time around.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.40</strong> Gordon Elliott’s <strong>Ndaawi </strong>trailed home in last place in the Cesarewitch on his latest start on the Flat but two big runs in ultra-competitive handicap hurdles since that setback suggest that he remains well handicapped on the level.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 3.00</strong> A slight ease in grade could see <strong>Shadow Of Light, </strong>last year’s Dewhurst winner, gain a confidence-boosting win.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7857ae84-4e63-4c8f-aa77-f7c4847110de\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster</b> 1.20 Stormy Monday 1.55 Obito 2.30 Indian Springs 3.00 Royal Velvet 3.35 Beaming Light 4.10 Queen Of Mougins (nb) 4.40 Hiya Maite 5.18 Arnhem&nbsp;<br><b>Bath</b> 2.00 Spinning Dancer 2.35 Karakula Dancer 3.08 Bohemian Breeze 3.43 Asinara 4.18 Supreme Diamond 4.50 Call Time 5.28 Albus Anne&nbsp;<br><b>Musselburgh</b> 2.15 Farandaway 2.50 Parisian Scholar 3.25 Rory The Cat 4.00 Drumcondra (nap) 4.33 I’m Next 5.08 This Years Love 5.43 Sanditon</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sweet William is punters’ darling again</h2> \n<p>There are horses that win with a minimum of fuss, and others, like Sweet William, that have a style that is all their own, and John &amp; Thady Gosden’s stayer kept it interesting throughout in the Doncaster Cup on Friday, as he overcame a slow start and some early coaxing from Rab Havlin in his saddle to win the Group Two contest for the second year running.</p> \n<p>Sweet William has often appeared to have his own ideas about the racing game during a 20-race career, with slow starts and mid-race flat spots frequently forcing Havlin to get busy at an early stage.</p> \n<p>When he eventually goes through the gears, however, he is a very difficult horse to keep out of the frame, and while his latest win was his first since the same race 12 months ago, his fourth-place finish in this year’s Ascot Gold Cup was the only time he has been outside the first three. His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.</p> \n<p>Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.</p> \n<p>Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”</p> \n<p>There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn. “Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”</p> \n<p>An impressive display of raw, frontrunning speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.</p> \n<p>“She’s a natural frontrunner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”</p>",

In fact, it is a scientific simulation – and for the first time a British pilot is among those training for the mission.</p> <p>Laura Marie, who was born in the UK and is now a pilot for a regional airline in the US, beat about 8,000 applicants to become one of six research volunteers who are preparing to spend 378 days inside the 158-sq-metre (1,700 sq ft) Mars Dune Alpha habitat at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p> <p>“It’s such a huge opportunity,” Marie told the Guardian. “And then to come this far and be in the final crew selection and heading down to training very, very soon is extremely exciting.”</p> <p>While the four “primary” crew members – Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery and James Spicer – are expecting to enter the simulation on 19 October, Marie – who has a BA in philosophy and an MSc in aeronautics – is one of two “alternate” participants, ready to step in should any of the others drop out.</p> <p>Marie said: “I am going down there with the same kind of mindset that everyone is going down there, of it being the 378 days.”</p> <p>The second of three Chapea (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/chapea/\">Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog</a>) missions, the experience is designed to help inform crewed missions to the red planet itself. The idea is the simulations will enable the collection of data relating to the physical health, psychology and performance of humans undertaking such an endeavour, with Nasa saying it could also aid assessment of its space food system.</p> <p>As in the first mission, the new crew will be growing crops, carrying out robotic operations and conducting simulated Mars walks, as well as testing technology designed for use on Mars, among other activities.</p> <p>“With science, you can’t just do something once,” said Marie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">Life on Mars ‘absolutely exhilarating’: Nasa scientist’s year in a simulation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marie, who grew up in Devon and immigrated to the US in 2016, said she was inspired to apply after hearing about the first mission as it was in progress.</p> <p>“I always had an interest professionally in working with Nasa in some kind of capacity,” she said. “So everything kind of aligned.

I spend a lot of time outside,” Marie said, adding the lack of sensations such as wind in her hair or the smell of grass could be difficult.</p> <p>Another significant challenge will be the communication delays that are designed to mimic the lag astronauts would experience on Mars when contacting Earth.</p> <p>“There’s no live chat with mission control,” said Marie, noting that even on the international space station, astronauts can be in real-time contact with Earth.</p> <p>But there will also be downtime, with Marie revealing she will be packing a Rubik’s Cube. “I’m not just going to learn how to do it. I want to beat a record,” she said.</p> <p>While the new mission is only a simulation of the Martian landscape, Marie said she would jump at an opportunity to head to the red planet itself. Indeed Nasa is developing technologies to enable crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.</p> <p>“One hundred per cent I would take that seat on that ride if it were ever offered to me,” Marie said. “I think the whole multi-planetary species, it’s where we’re heading. And anything I can do to be a part of it – if it’s this [Chapea programme], if it’s something else – I’m just happy to be involved.”</p>",

Ladapo has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/florida-joe-ladapo-investigated-covid-report-00084075\">defended</a> his stances on vaccines and Covid guidance, stating in 2023 in response to allegations he falsified a Covid report: “Between my scientific experience and training, and the fact that I am only comfortable saying the truth and speaking the truth, I felt completely fine with that announcement.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/12/chemtrails-rfk-jr-truth-behind-conspiracy-theory\">Chemtrails: why is RFK Jr battling a debunked conspiracy theory?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/florida-vaccine-mandate\">ended</a> vaccine mandates for children in Florida against preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis, comparing mandates to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/florida-vaccine-mandate\">slavery</a>” and claimed the move would receive the blessing “of God”. Florida is the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1870\">first state</a> in the US to do so.</p> <p>The Guardian made several attempts to reach Brianna Ladapo and Joseph Ladapo by email. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Florida department of health and DeSantis also did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>In a Substack <a href=\"https://briannaladapo.substack.com/p/freedom-our-forgotten-birthright\">post</a> on 5 September, Brianna Ladapo defended her husband’s decision to end vaccine mandates and claimed there are “dubious origins, nonexistent safety profiles, and dirty money trails surrounding vaccines”.</p> <p>She wrote in the post: “You believe in vaccines because you’ve been told to by a corrupt medical establishment that has a vested interest in keeping you subservient and stupid.”</p> <p>In a July 2025 <a href=\"https://new.clouthub.com/wpstream_vod/truth-be-told-with-brianna-ladapo/\">podcast</a>, Brianna Ladapo stated: “I often think if I hadn’t had to learn to trust my own gut and learn how to think and stand on my own two feet at such a young age, when Covid had come through, apparently swept away everyone’s brains, I might have been swept away right along with it if I didn’t already know how to listen to that truth that I believe is inside every single one of us.”</p> <p>She added in the podcast that “even to the lead-up, I was having visions, I was having dreams”, about the pandemic, before it began in early 2020. “Immediately, ridiculous inconsistencies started to show themselves.”</p> <p>She also appeared in an <a href=\"https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd-2024/bird-flu--polio-vaccine-nonsense--exclusive-interview-brianna-ladapo/\">interview</a> with the prominent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/health/cdc-kennedy-vaccine-disinformation.html\">anti-vaccine group</a> Children’s Health Defense in January 2025, in which she said: “If we all listen to our intuition, we listen to that voice, we would not fall for propaganda. Like, what’s happened with Covid. People did truly insane things to keep from catching a virus that over, well over 99% of people survived without intervention, right? That’s textbook insanity.”</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo has <a href=\"https://www.briannaladapo.com/events\">appeared</a> with his wife on stage at conferences on health and parenting.</p> <p>In Dr Ladapo’s 2022 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Fear-Blueprint-Mindful-Leadership/dp/1510774718?asin=1510774718&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1\">Transcend Fear</a>, he wrote that his wife has “a history of extraordinary experiences that were hard to explain with natural laws”. In March 2020, he wrote an op-ed for USA Today against shutdowns in response to Covid-19, the first of several he wrote about the virus, and noted that it was edited by his wife.</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo wrote in Transcend Fear that when he was recruited for the job of Florida surgeon general by DeSantis, his wife claimed it was the message she was waiting for.</p> <p>In Brianna Ladapo’s 2023 memoir, she <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Darkness-Spiritual-Memoir-Guide/dp/1510777849/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/144-3976682-3640302?pd_rd_w=Akdd8&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_r=XYZ73YX77CX1PQ6JDCH7&amp;pd_rd_wg=xp7jc&amp;pd_rd_r=c80b87c1-1823-489a-ac31-eb9b82d637cf&amp;pd_rd_i=1510777849&amp;psc=1\">claimed</a> “as long as I can remember, I have received communications from beings beyond this realm. Even as a young child, angels regularly spoke to me.”</p> <p>She added that “since I was born, I have also received constant communications in the form of visions” and that “eventually, every single one of them came to pass”.</p> <p>In the book, Brianna Ladapo claims she went on a “<a href=\"https://canvasrebel.com/meet-brianna-ladapo/\">pilgrimage</a>” trip to Egypt in graduate school during which she saw the rest of a “recurring vision” from a past life.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">video podcast on Rumble</a> earlier this year, she reiterated these claims about her “gifts”.</p> <p>“I was born a very sensitive child, the kind of kid who would see angels and talk to beings that no one else could necessarily perceive,” she said, claiming her family “perceived what was happening to me as satanic and demonic and evil”.</p> <p>“I saw a lot of angels, but my angels would talk to me and they saved my life multiple times,” she claimed.</p> <p>Brianna Ladapo also claimed their children together “have all been having experiences like this since they were born” and have “innate divine intelligence”.</p> <p>She claimed one of her children as a baby had “a gift” that was temporarily shared with her.</p> <p>“I started to hear conversations that sounded like they were right next to me. There were no people anywhere near us. And they were clearly from different eras, sometimes different countries, different languages and dialects,” Ladapo said.</p> <p>She said initially in their relationship, her husband was skeptical, but came to believe in her “gifts”.</p> <p>“After a number of years, he came to deeply trust my gift and now he won’t work with anybody I haven’t vetted,” she said. The couple did not respond to requests for comment about Brianna Ladapo’s vetting.</p> <p>Later in the podcast, Ladapo claimed she floated an inch above the ground during a session with a former Navy Seal and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christopherleemaher/?hl=en\">self-proclaimed traditional healing guru</a>, whom she said her husband had also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6929057317183203\">seen</a> and had similar experiences with. The healer declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.</p> <p>Ladapo is also a proponent of the chemtrails <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">conspiracy theory</a> about planes mass-dumping chemicals. She claims in the podcast interview that she and her children got sick because of chemtrails, and she used a patch that has been characterized as<a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/pseudoscience-technology/patchy-science-lifewaves-mysterious-patches\"> pseudoscience</a> by medical experts.</p> <p>“As we try to chase down where this is coming from, who is funding the companies who are flying the planes, who are piloting these planes, where are they taking off? We don’t even know where they are, because none of this is on the books.” Ladapo said about chemtrails.</p> <p>She added in the <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">podcast interview</a> about a photo of a Florida sky outside of her home: “This is how the chemtrails have been looking outside our window for the past few weeks. They are, I hate to say it, but that looks like a pentagram and they’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks.”</p> <p>She characterized the perceived chemtrailers as “dark forces” out to get her and her husband.</p> <p>“They’ve been trying to stop us for years,” she claimed. “We are operating at a level of light that puts us essentially out of the grasp of those with a very low vibration, very evil intention.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Marina Ramazashvili says son, Giorgi Bachiashvili, was the victim of a ‘vendetta’ by billionaire politician</p>",
    "content": "<p>The mother of a jailed former aide to Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused the de facto leader of Georgia of treating her son as his “personal prisoner” as she appealed to the west for help.</p> <p>Marina Ramazashvili, a renowned ophthalmologist in Georgia, said Giorgi Bachiashvili, who has allegedly been beaten in his prison cell, was the victim of a “vendetta” waged by the billionaire politician.</p> <p>The Georgian government, led by Ivanishvili, has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/mamuka-mdinaradze-to-be-georgia-security-chief-as-report-warns-of-descent-into-authoritarianism\">slipping into autocracy</a>, with the courts and the prosecution service increasingly under political control.</p> <p>“Maybe he is evil,” Ramazashvili, 65, said of Ivanishvili. “He has no humanity, he has no empathy. My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.</p> <p>Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.</p> <p>At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.</p> <p>Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/giorgi-bachiashvili-interview-georgia-bidzina-ivanishvili\">claimed in an interview with the Guardian</a> from his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.</p> <p>Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.</p> <p>Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.</p> <p>He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.</p> <p>He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.</p> <p>A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.</p> <p>“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”</p> <p>Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.</p> <p>Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.</p> <p>She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”</p> <p>Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.</p> <p>Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.</p> <p>“I have nothing inside,” she said.</p>",

    "title": "Partial to pre-drinks and a party? Your guide to getting the most out of student nightlife",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife",
    "description": "<p>The social side of university is good for your mental health and friendship circle, so consider where you’d be happiest to hang out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Choosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing.</p> <p>“Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the university <a href=\"https://yorksu.org/activities/view/album-society\">album society</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”.</p> <p>“Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs.</p> <p>But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan.</p> <p>“A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.”</p> <p>Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities.</p> <p>The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink.</p> <p>So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequently<a href=\"https://www.studentcrowd.com/page/best-universities-for-students-union\"> ranked best in the UK</a>, while the city’s DIY music scene<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/23/not-all-grassroots-venues-are-struggling-sheffields-leadmill-may-be-closing-but-the-citys-diy-hubs-are-thriving\"> continues to thrive</a>. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds.</p> <p>For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as&nbsp;possible. “You only get the university experience&nbsp;once.”</p>",

It was a moment – six Premier League games into his tenure – when people wondered whether his team might be the real thing. In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> \n  <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c544f78f086519d32714f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:26:00.709Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news: Arsenal v Nottingham Forest</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Eberechi Eze starts for the Gunners,</strong> as does Cristhian Mosquera with William Saliba out.

By all accounts he left coaches to do the coaching, as he well should, so we probably won’t really start seeing the impact of his successors until January or even next summer.

The defending champions have won all three of their fixtures so far but required late goals against Bournemouth and Newcastle after twice conceding two-goal leads, which pointed to defensive frailties.</p> \n  <p>Against Burnley on Sunday he will again need those resources up front - now bolstered by British-record signing Alexander Isak - against a team they will find hard to break down. Liverpool have scored eight goals, the most in the top flight, without creating that many clear-cut chances and Slot was asked how he hoped to improve that.</p> \n  <p>“To implement as best as possible the way we want to play,” he said.”But in the end the final third, it is also the form of your wingers mainly because of their playing style you end up more on the sides. The better they are, the bigger threat they are, the more chances we will generate and then nine out of 10 times it is about scoring.</p> \n  <p>“If you can score an early goal that normally helps you in a game like that. There are a lot of factors going into a game like this but as always we are hoping that our attackers make the difference and that is what they have to do every single game.”<br>But while Slot wants them to score the goals he also wants his attackers to improve their work-rate and defensive capabilities.</p> \n  <p>“If we lose the ball if we are really good in our counter-pressing that can create chances as well,” he added. “That is for me the biggest lesson of our game against Arsenal: in the first half we weren’t front-footed enough in terms of our pressing. In the second half we were and as a result we deserved to score in the second half.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c527628f084b3c85a4e024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:15:33.522Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Talking of Fitba, this piece, from the consistently excellent Nutmeg, is terrific*</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/smartphones-eroding-experience-watching-football-phones-escapism-games-impatiece\">Are smartphones eroding the experience of watching football?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><em>* Opinion, not fact</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c526928f084b3c85a4e021\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:11:47.681Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>As well as the big game at Easter Road, Rangers host high-flying Hearts at Ibrox with Russell Martin still looking for his first league win. </p> \n  <p>Rangers have drawn all four Premiership games under Martin, including a forgettable derby a fortnight ago.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report\">Martin and Rodgers feel heat as Rangers and Celtic fans boo drab stalemate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c4289b8f0880bae9c524f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:00:07.094Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arsenal v Nottm Forest x Big Ange (12.30pm)</strong></p> \n  <p>Will Unwin looks at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f8elrGU3AdU\">Nottingham Forest’s surprise decision</a> to sack Nuno Espírito Santo and replace him with Ange Postecoglou.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78b2d1ec-a634-45bc-a0b9-378ce95a2ca3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yz3PD1i880A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c523b68f084b3c85a4e012\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T07:58:33.988Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>“Oh matchday live, how could you?” <s>thunders</s> says Simon McMahon. “You forgot about about Dundee United’s trip to Easter Road to face Hibs at 5.45pm, so please, allow me.

    "description": "<p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. And the denim discourse is insufferable</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you are wearing clothes. Or my byline photo made you spontaneously strip down to nothing but a pair of crusty underwear and a smile. I don’t judge, and I also don’t blame you. That photo is from a decade ago.</p> <p>Assuming you’re in clothes, then you had to decide what to wear. It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only. Like a kid’s birthday or a hangover.</p> <p>You know what you won’t find in my closet?</p> <p>Jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\">Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel Connolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I hate jeans. Not even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK8s3iqL99c\">poorly conceived Sydney Sweeney commercial</a> could convince me I needed to buy jeans. If I had to choose between wearing denim and one of those <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GUN-GONE-GOONS-BARREL.png\">barrels cartoon hobos wear</a>, I’d choose the barrel. Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks. I panned for gold once, on a school field trip to <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485\">Sutter’s Fort</a> in fifth grade. I was not asked to go pro.</p> <p>Jeans make some people look like Bruce Springsteen – macho, blue collar and soulful. Jeans make me look like my dad – balding, with bad posture and a curious mustard stain on my crotch. Suits make me look grown up. Jeans make me look ground down. They make me look washed, cooked, chopped and all the other things my kid yells at me when I try to bend over to pick up one of his toys and I screech in pain.</p> <p>You can wear jeans if you want. I won’t stop you, but please, cease and desist with the denim discourse. A <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/bring-skinny-jeans-back\">recent GQ article</a> from July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/sperry-boat-shoes-hooked-me\">Another GQ article from this year</a>, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, or <a href=\"https://bamfstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wowspolo-main.jpg\">Jordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime</a>.</p> <p>I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)\">The Crow</a>. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.</p> <p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.</p> <p>I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.</p> <p>Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.</p> <p>The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/10/pradas-125bn-versace-takeover-a-new-era-for-italian-luxury\">controlled by billionaire conglomerates</a> that care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion is <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/shein-designated-biggest-fashion-polluter-bb25de66/\">contributing to global pollution</a> at an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.</p> <p>Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>Sainsbury’s has recalled two varieties of its own-brand hummus over fears they may contain a deadly strain of E coli, advising customers who have bought the products not to eat them.</p> <p>The affected items are 315g containers of JS Classic Houmous, with a use-by date of 13 September, and 200g tubs of JS Lemon &amp; Coriander Houmous with a use-by date of 14 September.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency said the affected batches could contain shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), and that the items had been recalled as a precaution.</p> <p>Point of sale notices will be displayed in all stores selling the products until 3 October, explaining to customers why they have been recalled and what to do if they have already bought them.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s apologised to customers for any inconvenience and advised them not to eat the affected products.</p> <p>The products covered by the recall can be returned to Sainsbury’s branches for a full refund.</p> <p>Symptoms of an E coli (Stec) infection include diarrhoea, with bleeding in half of cases, fever and abdominal pain. The illness is usually self-limiting. Most cases lasting up to two weeks.</p> <p>A small proportion of patients, mainly children, could develop life-threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure. A similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may also develop in a small proportion of adults.</p> <p>Stec bacteria are most prevalent in cattle in the UK, but have also been found in the faeces of deer, rabbits, horses, pigs and wild birds.</p> <p>Government guidance says the strain is particularly infectious because very few bacteria are needed to cause illness, allowing the disease to spread easily within families and other settings such as hospitals and schools.</p> <p>People can become ill through eating contaminated food, contact with infected animals or people who have the illness, and drinking water from inadequately treated sources.</p> <p>The UK Health Security Agency said there were 2,544 cases of Stec infection in England in 2024, a 26% rise compared with the year before.</p> <p>Several supermarkets were forced to ditch products in June last year when the sandwich makers Greencore and Samworth Brothers recalled their items during another outbreak of E coli.</p> <p>The two producers had to recall 60 products found to contain a variety of salad leaf linked to a Stec outbreak.</p>",

    "description": "<p>PM understood not to have seen messages from former ambassador to sex offender when speaking in Commons</p>",
    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer defended Peter Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and Jeffrey Epstein were passed to Downing Street, according to reports.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA.</p> <p>The prime minister is understood not to have been aware of the contents of the emails until Wednesday evening. By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer and Labour MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”. <br><br>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.</p> <p>“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> <p>“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”</p> <p>She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.</p> <p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”</p> <p>He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.</p> <p>The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.</p> <p>It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.</p> <p>His friendship with Epstein was known before his appointment, however, and he is reported to have told the Times that he admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with the convicted sex offsender for many years.</p> <p>Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer has “confidence in his top team” when asked whether questions had been raised over the judgment of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was reported to have lobbied for Mandelson’s appointment.</p> <p>The backbencher Clive Lewis publicly questioned Starmer’s leadership, telling the BBC the prime minister does not seem “up to the job”.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, another MP from the party’s backbenches, said “toxic” resentment was festering among the party’s MPs and rank and file members.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, one of two candidates to take Angela Rayner’s place as Labour’s deputy leader, called for a change of culture.</p> <p>“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” she said.</p> <p>Downing Street has been contacted for comment.</p>",

The home was then re-let to new tenants for £5,700 per month, a 19% increase.</p> <p>The government is planning to abolish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jan/14/tenants-landlords-discuss-renters-reform-bill\">no-fault evictions</a> under the renters’ rights bill and, in many situations, ban landlords from relisting their properties at higher rents for at least six months after evicting a tenant.</p> <p>Waheed Alli, who is worth an estimated £200m, has donated over £500,000 to Labour since 2020 and is one of the party’s largest donors. He spent weeks in the spotlight last year due to the tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, including spectacles and clothes donations to Starmer’s wife, Victoria. Starmer has also made temporary use of a £18m penthouse that belonged to Alli.</p> <p>No-fault evictions are one of the leading causes of homelessness, according to the charity Shelter, because they give landlords the power to evict tenants with just two months’ notice, without giving any reason for the eviction.</p> <p>The father of the family who was evicted from Alli’s house told the i newspaper they pleaded with the property’s management agent to allow them to meet the increased asking price and stay in the property: “We have children who were settled in local schools … so we wanted to avoid the disruption if we could.</p> <p>“We asked if there was any chance that we could even just stay an extra month so the kids wouldn’t be disrupted in September, and we could get through exams, but it was a no.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/labour-deputy-contender-lucy-powell-calls-for-culture-change-at-no-10\">Labour deputy contender Lucy Powell calls for culture change at No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking on Alli’s position as a Labour peer and major donor, the father added: “The hypocrisy just feels like too much … I voted Labour and I’m just incredibly disappointed.”</p> <p>Before Labour came to power, the government promised to “immediately abolish no fault eviction”, but has yet to name an implementation date for the renters’ rights bill. Recent Ministry of Justice data revealed that 11,400 households in England were forcibly removed from their homes by bailiffs as a result of these evictions between July 2024 and June 2025.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alli refused to explain the reasons the family were evicted. She said: “Lord Alli is not a commercial landlord and he doesn’t manage – and has never managed – this property. This is his former home where he no longer lives and where one tenant was replaced with another for less money than the former tenant offered and at an amount lower than the market price. Clearly, this was not about money.”</p> <p>The news comes a month after Rushanara Ali resigned as the government’s homelessness minister after it emerged she had evicted four tenants from a property she owns, then re-let it weeks later for £700 more a month.</p>",

It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p> <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\" data-alt=\"Inflation chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p> <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p> <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p> <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p> <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p> <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p> <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p> <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p> <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p> <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\" data-alt=\"jobs chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p> <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty\">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p> <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p> <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas, new report says, amid low awareness of disease</p>",
    "content": "<p>In February, Luna donated blood at her high school in Miami, with the goal of helping save others.</p> <p>“She was very proud to come home and say, ‘I gave blood today,’” her mother, Valerie, said. (The Guardian is not using the mother or daughter’s full names to protect their privacy.)</p> <p>It turned out, she was not able to save someone else’s life but potentially prevented herself from having serious health issues.</p> <p>A couple months later, she received a letter from the blood donation company informing her that she could not give blood. She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.</p> <p>Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.</p> <p>“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,’ … you’re like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.</p> <p>Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.</p> <p>Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.</p> <p>They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.</p> <p>“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”</p> <p>Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p> <p>It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.</p> <p>Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.</p> <p>About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.</p> <p>It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(10)01160-1/fulltext\">Gastroenterology journal</a>.</p> <p>More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs’ natural environment”, Beatty said.</p> <p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC’s <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article\">Emerging Infectious Diseases</a> journal.</p> <p>But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2953998/\">2010 survey</a> conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.</p> <p>“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that’s something that doesn’t exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.</p> <p>But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)</p> <p>Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.</p> <p>“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.</p> <p>After Valerie received the letter about Luna’s infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.</p> <p>That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.</p> <p>Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.</p> <p>Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.</p> <p>The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.</p> <p>The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.</p> <p>While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it’s less likely, Beatty said.</p> <p>“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”</p>",

But towering above them all, literally and figuratively, was Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and key enabler of the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Kirk, a 31-year-old rightwing activist, podcaster and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was killed on Wednesday</a> by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah. For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> <p>Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile\">grew up in an affluent suburb</a> of Chicago, the son of an architect whose firm designed the Trump Tower in New York. Rejected by the military academy at West Point, Kirk was 18 when he launched the grassroots organisation Turning Point USA in 2012, later admitting that he had “no money, no connections and no idea what I was doing”.</p> <p>Kirk’s rhetorical gift for provocative statements, inflaming cultural tensions and “owning the libs” galvanised conservative students during the Barack Obama years. He held mass rallies that drew tens of thousands of young voters each year to hear conservative leaders speaking on glitzy stages backed by ear-splitting anthems and bright pyrotechnics.</p> <p>He was the right man at the right time to pour rocket fuel on Trump’s Maga movement. In the summer of 2016 he secured a meeting at Trump Tower and gave Don Jr advice on how his father could woo young voters. Don Jr was so impressed that he instantly hired Kirk as his personal campaign assistant – or “bag boy”, as Kirk put it – as the pair took fundraising trips across the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kylespencerjournalist.com/\">Kyle Spencer</a>, a journalist and author of Raising Them Right: The Untold Story About America’s Ultraconservative Youth Movement and Its Plot for Power, said: “Don Jr didn’t think much of it until he started hanging out with Charlie and seeing how incredibly driven and ambitious he was, how skilled he was at building alliances with people of all different ages and how comfortable he was, even at a very early age, with people who had a tremendous amount of money and power. He was charming to those people but not intimidated and that was a winning combination.”</p> <p>A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/trump-kirk.html\">the New York Times reported</a>, Kirk was a guest at Don Jr’s birthday party at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump held a private conversation with him for 40 minutes.</p> <p>Spencer, who interviewed Kirk many times, continued: “Trump took a liking to him and that was very genuine. As much as Trump can have a relationship with someone and a fondness for them, he always had a real fondness for Charlie, and part of it was because he and Charlie are very similar.</p> <p>“Charlie had a kind of charismatic infectiousness and ability to draw certain people in a very similar way that Trump had. Charlie also had a real understanding of being at the forefront of media communication methods and that you always had to be a little bit ahead of the curve. Trump understood that too, which is why both of them were so comfortable building followings and communicating online and creating, in Charlie’s case, a lot of online assets.”</p>    <p>Vance said Kirk first made contact with him through a direct message on Twitter (now X) after the future vice-president appeared on Fox News in 2017. They became fast friends. Kirk was one of the first people Vance called when he thought of running for the Senate in early 2021, Vance said. Kirk introduced him to people who eventually ran his campaign – and to Don Jr.</p> <p>Vance, whom Kirk had championed as a potential running mate for Trump, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1965985360606888182\">tweeted this week</a>: “Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind. Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/black-students-colleges-racist-threats\">Black students and colleges across US targeted with racist threats day after Charlie Kirk killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By his own estimate, Kirk visited the White House more than a hundred times during Trump’s first term. In 2020, he published the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAGA-Doctrine-Only-Ideas-Future/dp/1094116238\">The Maga Doctrine</a>, a bestselling book that argued in favour of Christian nationalism and the “America First” agenda.</p> <p>He pushed conspiracy theories popular among white nationalists, including the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/cpac-republicans-democrats-america-trump-biden\"> false claim that the 2020 election was rigged</a> in favour of Joe Biden. His Turning Point Action group sponsored buses to take supporters to Washington ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on 6 January 2021, though Kirk himself did not attend. Two people connected to Turning Point Action, including its chief operating officer, served as fake electors in Arizona as part of Trump’s plot to steal the election.</p> <p>Kirk stuck by Trump during the wilderness years, in which the former president battled four criminal cases, and helped plot his improbable comeback. Turning Point Action was instrumental in driving youth support in last year’s election and was credited by Trump’s campaign for helping deliver the battleground state of Arizona.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/24/steve-bannon-war-room-republican\">Steve Bannon</a>, a godfather of the Maga movement, said by phone from Utah: “People underappreciated this: he changed the ground game. This ballot-chasing initiative was absolutely fundamental to winning in 2024. It will be fundamental going forward. What he did with young people is extraordinary.”</p> <p>Then Kirk played an outsized role in the presidential transition, advising Trump on his staff picks. Bannon, whose War Room podcast was followed by <a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/playlists/show/the-charlie-kirk-show/\">The Charlie Kirk Show</a> each day on the Real America’s Voice platform, said: “In the transition, Charlie basically moved to Mar-a-Lago. He was a central part of the transition.</p> <p>“He was, with Sergio Gor [director of the White House presidential personnel office], doing all the vetting and in a ton of meetings. He was so busy he skipped the show a bunch; I bet you Charlie only did a third of the shows during the Mar-a-Lago transition period. That’s how involved he was in the transition. The president liked having him around and he delivered.”</p> <p>Kirk supported the controversial nomination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/pete-hegseth-what-we-know\">Pete Hegseth</a>, a former Fox News host, as defence secretary. He also made the case for Turning Point USA allies to get government jobs. Bannon believes that Kirk’s “imprint” is felt in the defence, health, homeland security and other government departments.</p> <p>“Folks he didn’t know, he would do vettings. If he had a candidate or somebody he wanted to push, maybe not for a top level job but for second or third tier where the action is, people would go to Charlie. He had very active role and that continued. He spent a lot of time in Washington in the first couple months of the administration.”</p> <p>In January, Kirk travelled to Greenland with Don Jr to promote Trump’s declared ambition to acquire the Arctic territory. More recently he returned to Phoenix, Arizona, to work on Turning Point and prepare for next year’s midterm elections, Bannon added.</p> <p>“If Charlie had wanted a senior position in the government, it was there for the taking. He could have asked for virtually anything – maybe not a cabinet-level position but in a super-important position, either in the White House staff or in any of the department – and Charlie would have gotten what he wanted.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kirk remained in ideological lockstep with Trump and his inner circle, often echoing, amplifying and seeking to normalise their brazen displays of sexism, racism and Islamophobia. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wl3UwsNZ544?si=Y9yn_XXjc4bmQek7\" title=\"\">questioned the qualifications</a> of Black airline pilots, just as Trump had done during an attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p> <p>Jared Holt, a researcher at <a href=\"https://openmeasures.io/\" title=\"\">Open Measures</a>, a company that monitors influence operations online, said: “Kirk was a reliable propagandist who worked to sanitize the most alarming aspects of Trump’s movement. He relentlessly attacked Trump’s critics and demonized his scapegoats – immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities, to name a few.”</p> <p>There have been moments during Trump’s second term when Kirk was reportedly uncomfortable with the president’s decision to bomb Iran and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-response-epstein-files\">refusal to release files</a> on the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. But he was careful to avoid direct criticism of the man who was both political mentor and soulmate.</p> <p>After Kirk’s death this week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” The president ordered flags flown at half-mast and announced he would posthumously award Kirk the Medal of Freedom. Vance escorted Kirk’s body home to Phoenix on Air Force Two.</p> <p>His place in Maga mythology is assured, as his political legacy. <a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There are Turning Point people in the Trump administration and they are directly there because of Kirk’s influence. Charlie Kirk was talking about building a sustainable Maga movement. They’re playing for tomorrow. A lot of people are playing for today.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Watchdog says there are also allegations of discriminatory and misogynistic comments, centring on Charing Cross police station </p>",
    "content": "<p>Nine Scotland Yard officers have been suspended after an investigation was launched into claims of excessive use of force and the making of discriminatory and misogynistic comments.</p> \n<p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the allegations centre on Charing Cross police station in central London, the source of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/met-officers-joked-raping-women-police-watchdog-racist\">previous scandal</a> for the Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>The new investigation concerns 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the station. They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.</p> \n<p>The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”</p> \n<p>The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.</p> \n<p>The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.</p> \n<p>An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.</p> \n<p>The Met’s handling of the scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/met-officer-was-promoted-despite-misconduct-over-sexist-and-racist-messages\">with one officer being promoted</a>, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/commissioner-vows-to-clean-up-met-as-force-faces-biggest-crisis-since-1970s\">transform the culture</a> of Britain’s biggest police force.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/stephen-lawrence-mother-doreen-plea-witnesses-review\">Stephen Lawrence’s mother makes plea for witnesses as review begins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.</p> \n<p>The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.</p> \n<p>“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”</p> \n<p>The Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said: “The behaviour as reported is disgraceful and nine officers were suspended within 24 hours of the allegations being assessed and another two officers have been removed from frontline duties.</p> \n<p>“We are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by professional standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings. The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”</p> \n<p>Twist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”</p> \n<p>The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.</p> \n<p>“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facility</a> in Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.</p> \n<p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”</p> \n<p>The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/astrazeneca-invest-us-trump-tariff-threats\">would invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030</a>, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.</p> \n<p>The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.</p> \n<p>The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country into <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapped a £1bn London research centre</a> as well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.</p> \n<p>Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.</p> \n<p>A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">other big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investing</a> in the UK.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> \n<p>Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">told the Guardian</a> Britain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.</p> \n<p>Sanofi said: “Any substantial inward investment into the UK is currently on pause until we see tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive.”</p> \n<p>Also this week, Eli Lilly, a US drugmaker, said its planned London gateway lab, an incubator space for new drugs that brings together researchers, part of a £279m investment, was on hold.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceutical industry has long argued that the UK needs to spend more on new medicines, bringing the NHS’s outlay on medications more in line with other countries.</p> \n<p>A row between the sector and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, intensified after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">long-running NHS pricing negotiations broke down without an agreement </a>in late August. Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.</p> \n<p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/13/hundreds-baltic-tracking-russia-shadow-fleet-oil-tankers",
    "description": "<p>The Guardian joins the Swedish coastguard to patrol an area that has become a hybrid warfare battleground </p>",
    "content": "<p>In front of a bank of screens on the boat’s bridge, the Swedish<strong> </strong>coastguard Jan Erik Antonsson shows on a live map on a laptop how many vessels of Russia’s “shadow fleet” there are in the area. “These green symbols are the shadow fleet,” he says. More than a dozen green triangles representing shadow fleet vessels pop up around the coastline of southern Sweden alone. </p> \n<p>Every day hundreds of shadow fleet ships – unregulated ageing tankers from around the world in varying states of repair carrying oil from Russia to states including China and India – are moving through a relatively narrow passage in the Baltic.</p> \n<p>What was previously hoped would effectively become “Nato lake” after Finland and Sweden joined Nato, has instead become a battleground for hybrid warfare and the shadow fleet, which move under various identities and change flags to circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Some shadow ships are understood to be accompanied by Russian military vessels, others have planes following their route from above to make sure they get to their intended destination.</p> \n<p>The Guardian was given rare access to the coastguard’s operations, accompanying KBV 003 from the port of Karlskrona on an eight-hour patrol of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.</p> \n<p>“Sea traffic in the Baltic has increased somewhat copiously with the whole shadow fleet, but also with Nato ships, defence ships and the coastguard,” says the vessel’s captain, Joakim Håkansson. “So we try to get far out and show that we’re here.” </p> \n<p>In the Bornholm strait, where shipping traffic is divided like a motorway, shadow fleet vessels pass less than 10 nautical miles off the coast of Sweden. In our vicinity<strong> </strong>off the rocky Blekinge archipelago<strong>,</strong> there are two.</p> \n<p>Later the coastguard follows one, an oil tanker currently flagged in Malta that according to online maritime records has in the last two years also<strong> </strong>been flagged in the Marshall Islands under a different name. As long as vessels are in a country’s economic zone as opposed to its smaller territorial sea – at most 12 nautical miles offshore – the grounds for intervention are extremely limited, but as of July, the coastguard is allowed to contact the vessel to request information about the ship and its insurance. A crew member on the oil tanker says over the radio its last port of call was Primorsk, Russia, and it is carrying just under 30,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Its next stop, he says, is Aliağa in Turkey. Its end destination is impossible to know, but the Swedish coastguard is certain this ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet.</p> \n<p>The radio call is part of a new government plan aimed at tightening checks on the shadow fleet amid fears of a serious oil spill. The vessels are under no obligation to respond, but so far the coastguard says ships have been cooperative.</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of [shadow] ships moving in the Baltic all the time. And it’s a lot for our little sea here,” says Håkansson. “We see ships that have never been seen in the Baltic before that we come across now.” They need to build a picture of how seaworthy the ships are, he says, “because if there was an oil accident with these ships there would be an oil catastrophe in the Baltic”.</p> \n<p>Security in the Baltic has changed dramatically since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says Håkansson. As well as the growing shadow fleet, there is increasing disturbance to satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS, and Baltic authorities must keep a close eye on undersea infrastructure. In the event of an oil spill, the coastguard would be responsible for emergency response and clean-up. There is also a growing physical threat from the Russian military, as its presence has “stepped up” in the Baltic, says Håkansson.</p> \n<p>Håkansson also comes across ships he strongly suspects of spying. “Before they had these research ships [for spying]. Lately they have been using cargo ships to do these operations,” he claims. </p> \n<p>But unless there is evidence of an environmental crime, a fishing crime or some sea traffic crimes, the Swedish coastguard’s ability to act on such threats is extremely limited. According to the rules of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that deals with safety and security of shipping, “the shadow fleet is allowed to move freely in the whole of the Baltics”, says Jonatan Tholin, a preliminary investigation manager for the Swedish coastguard.</p> \n<p>National law can only apply in a country’s territorial waters, in the country’s broader economic zone it is the legislation of the country that the flag is shipped in that counts.</p> \n<p>The problems caused by the shadow fleet are exemplified by Eagle S, an oil tanker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/finland-accuses-tanker-crew-sabotage-undersea-cables-anchor\">suspected of damaging five undersea cables</a> by dragging its anchor between Finland and Estonia in December 2024. Finnish authorities filed charges against members of the crew, arguing that although the measures were carried out outside Finland, the effects of the crime materialised in Finland, meaning it falls into its jurisdiction. The crew members deny the charges.</p> \n<p>However, Tholin believes the most dangerous risk of the shadow fleet is its uninsured vessels, which in the event of an oil spill could have huge financial and environmental costs. “It means it will be taxpayer, the state, who pays,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>It was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.</p> <p>As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jun/21/electric-vehicles-carsick\">Research has shown</a> this is an issue – people who did not usually have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">motion sickness</a> in a conventional car found that they did in EVs.</p> <p>For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.</p> <p>“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.</p> <p>Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.</p> <p>The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22674\">Research carried out in China</a>, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.</p> <p>Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@atiahchayne/video/7531869808762146070\">posted on TikTok</a> about her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.</p> <p>Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”</p> <p>John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.</p> <p>While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.</p> <p>He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014193822500232X\">such as vibrations in the car seat</a> that warn the passenger when the car is turning.</p> <p>Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.</p>    <h2>How to cope with motion sickness</h2> <p>Experts and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/motion-sickness/\">the NHS suggest</a> behavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.</p> <p><strong>Sit at the front</strong> Knowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.</p> <p><strong>Try motion sickness medications</strong> These come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be taken <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html#:~:text=most%20effective%20when%20taken%20before%20exposure\">before travelling</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wear </strong><strong>ac</strong><strong>upressure</strong><strong> bands </strong>These are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,<em>” </em>Golding says.</p> <p><strong>Listen to a 100hz sound</strong> for a minute. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11955832/\">Research</a> from Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Customised plates often cost more than the car – and yet the number of people queueing up to buy them is at an all‑time high. What’s the appeal?</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.</p> <p>Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a&nbsp;world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit. The question is: why?</p> <p>John Harrison, 75, is known as the “modern godfather” of autonumerology – the hobby of being enormously into registration plates. He tells me over the phone: “You’ve got people who are mainly interested in what I’d call the pattern of numbers, the more technical side; people interested in personal numbers; people interested in foreign plates. I do a bit of all three.” As a&nbsp;child, like many number-plate fans, he scribbled down the ones he saw on the road and started looking up some of their details. He tracked the work of the late Noel&nbsp;Woodall, the hobby’s true OG, who wrote 24 – yes, 24 – books about registration plates. (One of them is called Where’s It From? When Was It Issued?) Harrison has limited himself to just the one title: The Number Plate Book.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, I meet Harrison face to face at the annual Registration Numbers Club rally at the Wythall Transport Museum in Worcestershire – the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comic-con\">Comic-Con</a> for number-plate fans. They convene there to admire one another’s wares and hand out tongue-in-cheek awards, and have done so for almost 50 years.</p>    <p>I also meet Neal Bircher, who might be more interested in number plates than anyone else on the face of the Earth. He is my introduction to the world of Facebook groups for plate fans, and I join one called Private Number Plate Enthusiasts, which is like a&nbsp;birdspotting group for number-plate devotees. Bircher’s car boasts “NEA 1”, and over the years he has owned various iterations of his initials, “NAB”. He also owns “149 PCE”, the number plate on the truck at the heart of Steven Spielberg’s first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/13/duel-at-50-steven-spielberg-debut-thriller\">Duel</a>. He still yearns for “NB1” or “NA1”, or perhaps “A1”, which enthusiasts tend to consider the great white whale of the plate world. “A1” is perhaps the only plate with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_registration_plate\">own Wikipedia page</a>. It is owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, and would sell for multiple millions.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple millions, at the rally I also meet Richard Conway. I know about Conway because I have heard he is selling the “1 HRH” plate on his Bentley for £2.5m. (He doesn’t throw in the Bentley for that price.) It is a valuation that raises eyebrows everywhere I mention it. “Too much,” Harrison says. “If you’re a&nbsp;multimillionaire, two-and-a-half may be peanuts, but to me it sounds, shall we say, somewhat ambitious.”</p> <p>Angela Banh is marketing manager for Regtransfers, which, as the biggest number-plate broker in the country, advertises some plates for millions of pounds. “F1”, which belongs to car entrepreneur Afzal Kahn, was&nbsp;listed on the website until recently and he expects £15m for it. Does she think “1 HRH” is worth £2.5m? “It’s not one that we would value at that kind of figure,” Banh says. “But that doesn’t mean someone’s not going to pay two-and-a-half for it.”</p>    <p>Conway, 50, is an entrepreneur who also owns the Number Plate Company Group Limited. He won’t tell me how much he paid for “1 HRH”, of course, but in 2009 it changed hands at a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) auction for £92,000 plus VAT and fees. He bought it 13 years later, but hadn’t intended on selling it. Like various other enthusiasts, he likens the hobby to collecting expensive paintings. “I might think: ‘What an idiot. They’ve spent £3m on that piece of art.’ But that’s because I don’t understand the market.” He tells me he has already turned down seven-figure offers. What if King Charles tapped him on the shoulder? “I&nbsp;think that’s unlikely,” he smiles. The reverse plate – “HRH 1”, which those in the business consider the “right” way around because the letters come first – was given to Queen Elizabeth II as an engagement present by the original owner. Conway doesn’t seem likely to give his up for free.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Back in Chichester, the price of lot 56 is still rising: £300,000, £310,000, £320,000. The number plate in question is “JB 1”, once the property of Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealer John&nbsp;Barclay. Why is the plate so valuable? Because “JB” has a good claim to being the most common set of initials in the country. (To help them come to an accurate valuation, Regtransfers has a database of names and surnames.) “330,” says the auctioneer. “340 … ” One of the bidders in the room is John Doherty, buy-in manager for Regtransfers, sitting with Banh. He has just bid £350,000. There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people.</p> <p>In 2019, when the DVLA surveyed drivers with an interest in private number plates, they found that 6% wanted them for their business; 17% considered them an investment; and 69% bought them because of a&nbsp;personal connection. The perception of people who go in for personalised number plates isn’t famously positive. Of&nbsp;course, hardcore hobbyists demur, making the point that being really into number plates doesn’t <em>necessarily </em>make you an overcompensating flash prat. “It’s not about ‘Me, me, me – look at me,’” Bircher says. “It’s ‘I find this interesting.’ I say to people, ‘What on earth is showy about the squiggles on the plate on the front of your car?’”</p> <p>One noticeable thing about the enthusiasts is that they tend to be older, white and male. But bucking one of those trends is 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/numberplatehistory/?hl=en\">Kit Joubert</a>, who is making a splash on Instagram with an account devoted to exploring the history of number plates. He presents slick videos in which he discusses notorious plates, always with access to the cars they are on. Joubert thinks that over the last couple of decades the public perception has changed significantly, to the point that a personalised number plate is now simply another part of car customisation. “There’s a shift beginning to happen,” he says, “and I, for better or worse, might be the face of that, at least on social media.” Because there is often an overlap between fast cars and lucrative number plates, the hobby is well suited to visual platforms such as Instagram. Joubert recently organised a meet-up for plate enthusiasts, which he claims was the first to happen without the involvement of the Registration Numbers Club. He wants to make number plates his full-time job in the next year. “It’s changed my life,” he says.</p>    <p>Number plates were introduced to British roads under the 1903 Motor Car Act and, as Harrison explains in his book, at first they were one or two letters (denoting an area of the country), followed by up to four numbers. Harrison believes the first to have been a Hastings plate, “DY 1”. (The letters correlated to the size of the local authority. London, the largest, had “A”. Once the end of the alphabet was reached, “AA” took effect.) After the numbers were used up, letters were added before the two initials. Then, in the 1950s, the reversed format was phased in: “1234 AB”. In the 60s, letters were added to the end, with the “A” suffix in “AMP 595A” denoting 1963, for example. From the 1980s things got increasingly convoluted – one of the many reasons that people yearn for the beautiful simplicity of those early plates.</p> <p>Another explanation for the popularity of plates today is that the DVLA has cottoned on to how much of a cash cow the hobby is. In 1977 the government was plotting to make the transfer of plates more expensive and difficult. “No one could make a convincing claim that he would suffer genuine hardship if he could no longer afford to transfer his cherished mark or his personalised number plate,” <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1977-01-24/debates/0fec342e-5409-4742-8b16-fa86f457252a/RoadVehicles(RegistrationMarkTransfers)\">said the MP John Horam</a>. The Registration Numbers Club formed in opposition to this philosophy, and ultimately won the fight. Now, the DVLA would never seek to make the process more difficult: the DVLA’s head of external communications points me to an <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687e00805f0f5104b9806beb/DVLA_annual_report_and_accounts_2024_to_2025.pdf\">annual report</a> that says in 2024-25 they made more than £274m from personalised number plates. (The organisation charges an £80 fee for every plate sold.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if ‘OAS 1S’ might go for a silly amount. The DVLA are no fools when it comes to the timing of their release</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The DVLA held its first auction in 1989. Initially, it&nbsp;simply sold plates that had already been issued. Over time, however, it has become possible to request&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific plate be created and auctioned. If it is valid and unreleased, it could be yours. Once upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, all of the DVLA’s auctions were in-person, but when attendance fell during the pandemic, it moved&nbsp;them all to its website. In June, I register to check one out.</p> <p>I am interested in this specific auction because I want to know if “OAS 1S” might go for a silly amount of money. (The DVLA is no fool when it comes to the timing of its releases.) Also up for grabs is “95 A”, which Bircher tells me is the first three-character plate to be auctioned in five years. As I watch, I can see the prices rise in real time. At the end of the five-day auction, “OAS 1S” is at £56,040; “95 A” has secured £71,010; but the winner is “8 FU”, which has sold for £90,000. Harrison’s insight is that “Fu” is a common surname in China, where the number eight is also considered lucky.</p>    <p>“FU” brings us to another subject: <a href=\"https://www.regtransfers.co.uk/content/hundreds-2025-plates-banned\">naughty plates</a>. Banh tells me that until 2024, “FU” was suppressed (because of its “fuck you” connotations). As Harrison says in his book, censorship has been a concern since the very beginning. “DD” was originally considered too problematic to have on a car because the initials stood for “drop dead”. When local authorities were allocated two-letter prefixes, Dorset were disgruntled with “BF” because it was considered to stand for “bloody fool”; “666” used to be deemed too offensive for sensitive eyes. “They go around in circles,” Banh says. “What was considered rude many years ago is no longer rude now.” Currently you can have a “PEN 15” but you can’t have an “AR25 HOL”.</p> <p>At the rally I meet Matthew Edwards, 56, who is selling his “S69 CUM” plate for £15,000. (His wife no longer finds it funny.) For a while he also had “K21 KKK” – until the DVLA decided “KKK” was too offensive to be allowed on the road. He had bought it purely to sell it, but that became all but impossible. “I couldn’t give it away,” he says.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in Chichester, “JB 1” has broken the £400,000 barrier. Everyone but Doherty and a&nbsp;mysterious bidder on the phone has dropped out. The bidding goes up to £410,000, then £420,000, then £430,000. When it creeps up to £500,000, an audible murmur goes around the room. The record is within touching distance.</p> <p>“Is it any different from adorning your car with anything else – to having a special paint job, or having some bolt-on goodie? I don’t know,” says Nicholas Young, 76, as I sit in his Rolls-Royce (number plate “NY 1”). Young, whose fascination lies in the history of number plates, concedes that it is “childish and stupid” to buy plates because they match your initials. He also admits that’s exactly what he’s done.</p> <p>Young has also written his own book – the colossal Car Number Classics (“I was impressed not only by its weight, but certainly more by its contents!” one of the reviewers said) – and he has no interest in treating the plates as a way to get rich. “If I say I christened my son after a number plate, that really does sound sad,” he says, “but his name is the same as mine. So they’ll go to him.”</p>    <p>In Chichester, the anonymous bidder on the phone is head-to-head with Doherty. They’re at £500,000. “510,” the auctioneer says. He looks at Doherty, who nods. “520,” he says. With that, it has broken the UK record. Joubert, who is standing feet away from me, is well aware of this. “530,” the auctioneer says, taking a bid from the phone. There is a silence. “530,” he repeats, looking at Doherty. He shakes his head. As the auctioneer raises his hammer, fireworks crash somewhere above our heads. “530,000,” he says, banging his hammer. The room breaks out into applause. It is an astonishing turn of events. With the addition of fees and VAT, “JB&nbsp;1” has sold for £608,600. Is it simply three squiggles on a&nbsp;sheet of metal? Or is it a priceless piece of history? As&nbsp;Edwards says: “You either get it or you don’t.”</p> <p>Who is the mysterious new owner of “JB 1”? Weeks later, I hear back from the auctioneer who had the bidder on the other end of the phone. I wanted to know if they might be willing to speak to me. “I spoke to the buyer,” he says. Yes? “And I can confirm they would like to remain anonymous.” Damn. “However, they are fine to say that they have the initials JB.” Justin&nbsp;Bieber? Joe&nbsp;Biden? Jeff&nbsp;Bezos? Jack Black? James Blunt? Juliette Binoche, perhaps? I have chosen to believe it was Jim&nbsp;Broadbent. But we may never know. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The American dream has never looked more seductive, with long and loose summer wardrobes and beachy jewellery</p>",
    "content": "<p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p> <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p> <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p> <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this New York fashion week, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p> <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p> <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p> <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before New York fashion week began.</p> <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p> <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>  ",

He&nbsp;describes his adopted city as “a peaceful and&nbsp;friendly place, with&nbsp;a mix of heritage buildings and modern life”.

They moved in a tight, repeated loop, and on this day the light was soft and just right to capture their movement clearly,” he says. He&nbsp;utilised his phone camera’s slo-mo mode “to create a visual that almost feels like it was drawn with light. Their flight formed a fluid, layered pattern, like an&nbsp;S-shaped ribbon floating in space.”</p> <p>Chavali immediately knew he’d captured something special, converting the photo to&nbsp;black and white to remove distractions and&nbsp;emphasise texture. He&nbsp;notes a “kind of visual poetry and a&nbsp;reminder that wonder can be found in quiet, overlooked places. These birds have adapted to concrete spaces we have built over their habitats, yet&nbsp;they continue to move through the city with elegance and ease.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Combining both salty and sour flavours, gherkins act as a great elevator for many a dish or just as a standalone snack. But whose strikes the perfect balance?</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/27/from-kimchi-to-kombucha-its-easy-to-ferment-at-home-heres-the-kit-you-need\"><strong>From kimchi to kombucha, it’s easy to ferment at home. Here’s all the kit you need</strong></a></p>",
    "content": "<p>A jar of gherkins reminds me of the sea around the British Isles – murky, seaweed-green and mysterious – and of that bizarre marine animal, the sea cucumber (though sea gherkin would perhaps be more accurate, given how similar some species look). Gherkins also happen to be one of my favourite foods, though I usually eat them straight from the jar and rarely save any for all those recipes that benefit from their addition, from potato salads to bloody marys.</p> <p>I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p> <p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed? </p> <p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

The jar is packed with dill and mustard seeds, and pieces of pepper. Very sweet at first, then the sourness cuts through, followed by complex mustard and ginger notes, and a fragrant dill finish. An impressively clean ingredients list and a very low salt content (<a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/baxters-whole-gherkins-crunchy-tangy-600g/113375597#:~:text=Salt-,0.86g,-Similar%20Products\">0.86%</a>).

Even though they’re pasteurised, there’s a slight lacto-funk, too (either because they’ve started to re-ferment or these are residual flavours from pre-pasteurisation), which I like. <em>Very</em> salty, though (3.75%).</p> <p>***</p> <h2>And the rest …</h2> <h2>Kühne gourmet gherkins with herbs</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/kuhne-gourmet-selection-gherkins-with-herbs/582929-805767-805768\" > £2.85 for 530g at Waitrose (54p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/kuhne-gourmet-gherkins-with-herbs/575084011\" > £3 for 530g at Ocado (57p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★★☆</p> <p>More cornichons than gherkins, so very different from the others tested. Yellowy-green, with a long flavour profile that moves from dill and onion to sourness, salt and, finally, mustard and black pepper. The crunch is perfect, too. A 10th-generation German brand with a simple recipe; the salt content is a little high, but no artificial stuff in here. Good value, given the sheer quality.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Asda pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/pickled-onions-vegetables/asda-pickled-gherkins-680g/3778220\" > £1.13 for 680g at Asda (17p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small, moss-green and with a very tangy flavour and sharp mustard heat. A simple flavour profile with a lovely, celery-like note that lingers. Not too salty, and the crunch is good. Calcium chloride-free, too, which is worth noting for those avoiding additives.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Tesco gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/280068606\" > £1.15 for 680g at Tesco (17p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small, army-green and with a sharp, extra sour flavour and a salty kick. The taste is one-dimensional, but they do the job. Less crunchy and more watery than most, but still good value for a straightforward pickle.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Morrisons whole gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/morrisons-whole-gherkins-680g/105096328\" > £1.40 for 680g at Morrisons (21p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small and knobbly, with a sweet aroma. The flavour also opens with sweetness, moves into a gentle sourness, then a touch of mustard. While there’s nothing to complain about, these don’t offer much in the way of complexity or interest, but, that said, they’re nicely crunchy. A solid, good-value option.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Epicure whole pickles with dill and red pepper</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/309766369\" > £3.75 for 970g at Tesco (39p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/epicure-original-whole-pickles/587054011\" > £3.75 for 970g at Ocado (39p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized gherkin with a juniper-green hue. Balanced, sweet-sour flavour with strong savoury notes of onion and red pepper, and not over salty. The crunch is OK, but not excellent. Contains “flavourings”. This product won two Great Taste stars in 2022, so perhaps the recipe has changed since?</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Mrs Elswood haimisha gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers-670g\" > £2.50 for 670g at Sainsbury’s (37p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers/034470-17297-17298\" > £2.90 for 670g at Waitrose (43p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized, bendy “wally” (as my London-born stepdad used to say) with a golden olive hue. The flavour is dominated by salt, which overwhelms any nuance aside from lingering dill and onion notes. The crunch is decent, though. Mrs Elswood is a heritage brand, <a href=\"https://www.mrselswood.com/about#:~:text=CONTACT-,SINCE%201947,-The%20story%20of\">founded in 1947</a>, that shows more consideration for sustainability than some. Uses additives, though, which detracts from the overall appeal.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Sainsbury’s pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-pickled-gherkins-340g-7863266-p-44\" > £1.35 for 340g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g) </a>  <p>★☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A cocktail-sized, mossy-hued green gherkin. Has a soupy and quite sweet preserved aroma, with strong capsicum and onion notes. Unfortunately, the spirit vinegar hits harshly at the back of the throat. The crunch is very good, though. These contain sulphites, which are unnecessary additives of potential concern, especially when simpler recipes are tastier.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dawtona pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/pickled-onions-vegetables/dawtona-gherkins-pickled-cucumbers-in-vinegar-brine-with-spices-900-g/9105186\" > £1.94 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/262299348\" > £2.90 for 900g at Tesco (32p/100g) </a>  <p>☆☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A decent-sized snozzcumber (as Roald Dahl’s BFG might say), ranging in colour from dark army-green to iridescent yellow chartreuse, but, sadly, I think I had a spoiled jar. There’s a slight saltiness, but it’s overshadowed by a stale flavour that’s hard to ignore, plus the texture is softer and moister than you’d expect. As a result, these are disqualified – sorry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Buttons\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/business/media/severance-the-pitt-emmys.html\">current state of the television business</a>. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Severance</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Andor</p> <h2><strong>Best comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Abbott Elementary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/26/the-bear-season-four-review-finally-becoming-the-show-it-was-always-destined-to-be\">The Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/11/hacks-season-four-review-the-return-of-this-extremely-funny-hugely-raw-comedy-is-a-sheer-pleasure\">Hacks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/27/only-murders-in-the-building-season-four-review-by-far-the-funniest-thing-on-tv\">Only Murders in the Building</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/shrinking-season-two-review-harrison-ford-comedy-apple-tv\">Shrinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/26/the-studio-review-seth-rogens-hollywood-satire-is-fast-furious-and-beautifully-fun\">The Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny\">What We Do in the Shadows</a></p> <p>Another interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Studio</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Hacks</p> <h2><strong>Best limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/17/adolescence-netflix-powerful-tv-could-save-lives\">Adolescence</a>, Black Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv\">Dying for Sex</a>, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Penguin</p> <p>Of all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/09/france-netflix-uk-drama-adolescence-teach-toxic-masculinity-schools\">fixture in secondary school programs</a> across Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">thematic lightning rod</a>, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a drama series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pedro-pascal\">Pedro Pascal</a> (The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)</p> <p>It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)</p> <p>Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)</p> <p>If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into the Emmys with 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Seth Rogen</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adam Brody</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a comedy series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)</p> <p>Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win. Smart has won thrice previously for her late career-defining role as the brittle, brassy comedian Deborah Vance. There’s no reason why she shouldn’t continue her streak for Hacks’ fourth season, for her portrait of just how awful it can be – how vengeful, vicious and wounded one can become – when they get everything they wanted.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Jean Smart</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence), Jake Gyllenhaal (Presumed Innocent), Brian Tyree Henry (Dope Thief), Cooper Koch (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story)</p> <p>This one is a toss-up, with strong performances across the board, and it’s nice to see the always excellent Brian Tyree Henry get a nod for Dope Thief, one of many Apple TV series that, like Gyllenhaal’s Presumed Innocent, disappear into the streaming ether soon after release. Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario. But Colin Farrell, who won the Golden Globe and SAG awards earlier this year for his full vanity disappearance in The Penguin, may have the edge here.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Colin Farrell</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Stephen Graham</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Cate Blanchett (Disclaimer), Meghann Fahy (Sirens), Rashida Jones (Black Mirror), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin), Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)</p> <p>Look, Cate Blanchett is, indisputably, one of the best actors of her generation, but the muddled Apple TV show Disclaimer is not a worthy showcase of her talents. In a similar vein, I want awards for Meghann Fahy, who was the deceptively nuanced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/13/white-lotus-daphne-sullivan-character-meghann-fahy\">true star of the White Lotus’s second season</a>, but Netflix’s Sirens was outright bad, and her performance in it iffy. Cristin Milioti is delivering career-best work in the Penguin, but voter preference will skew toward the perennially nominated Michelle Williams, whose performance in Dying for Sex is up to her very high standards – spiky, layered, vulnerable and totally convincing.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Michelle Williams</p> <h2><strong>Scripted variety series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a></p> <p>I maintain that it is not fair to pit the thoroughly researched, impeccably delivered deep dives of Last Week Tonight against the deliberately loose sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live.

But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>The Daily Show</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)</p> <p>Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast. Tillman deserves for his unnerving and unforgettable performance as a corporate henchman, but I bet voters prefer Goggins’s especially miserable tourist.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Walton Goggins</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Tramell Tillman</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Patricia Arquette (Severance), Carrie Coon (The White Lotus), Katherine LaNasa (The Pitt), Julianne Nicholson (Paradise), Parker Posey (The White Lotus), Natasha Rothwell (The White Lotus), Aimee Lou Wood (The White Lotus)</p> <p>Another, more exciting White Lotus-off! I would’ve liked to see Leslie Bibb nominated as well for her pitch-perfect portrayal of a secret Texas Republican, or for Katherine LaNasa to get more attention for her radiant calm on the Pitt.

    "content": "<h2>Why Terence Crawford will beat Canelo Álvarez</h2> \n<p>For years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/terence-crawford\">Bud Crawford</a>’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so complete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/30/terence-crawford-after-spence-win-im-pound-for-pound-no-1-without-a-doubt\">it cemented his place</a> in boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/terence-crawford-profile-canelo-alvarez-fight\">Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a5ca207-01c6-4e22-8a75-8e43030f4b13\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\"><b>Canelo v Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's happening?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where and when is the fight?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What belts are on the line?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where can I watch it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who else is fighting?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights</p>\n    <p>• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights</p>\n    <p>• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights</p>\n    <p>• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights</p>\n    <p>• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweight</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Main card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights</p>\n    <p>• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championship</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Canelo’s vulnerabilities are not theoretical. Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\">Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.</p> \n<p>Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-how-boxing-won-the-lottery-but-lost-the-ticket-again\">present company included</a>. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.</p> \n<p>The weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.</p> \n<p>The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Why Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence Crawford</h2> \n<p>Next month it will be 20 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez\">Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez</a> made his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.</p> \n<p>Years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/saul-canelo-alvarez-i-want-to-keep-fighting-my-whole-life-i-so-enjoy-it\">he confided</a> that “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”</p> \n<p>Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The great Terence Crawford is, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/alvarez-and-crawford-face-off-in-breathless-blockbuster-destined-to-break-records\">Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break records</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-boxing-fight-arlington-texas-report-result\">sharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tyson</a> in 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.</p> \n<p>Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.</p> \n<p>Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.</p> \n<p>This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.</p> \n<p>Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/04/terence-crawford-beats-israil-madrimov-to-become-four-division-champion\">looked diminished against Israil Madrimov</a> – who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.</p> \n<p>Álvarez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/04/canelo-alvarez-terence-crawford-william-scull-fight\">looked terrible in his last fight</a>, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/11/jaron-boots-ennis-eimantas-stanionis-fight-preview\">Jaron “Boots” Ennis</a>, who would test Crawford at welterweight.</p> \n<p>Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez\">he was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013</a>, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.</p> \n<p>But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.</p> \n<p>Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Priestdaddy author on quitting social media, Maga conspiracies and how her second novel grew out of a period of post-Covid mania</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patricia-lockwood\">Patricia Lockwood</a> does whenever she spots a priest while walking through an airport. The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like: <em>I know</em>.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.</p> <p>This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-gilbert\">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> than a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.</p> <p>So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”</p> <p>All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experienced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”</p> <p>I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.</p> <p>The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”</p>    <p>As I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”</p> <p>These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked about <em>cancel culture</em>. It is my greatest fear, to be asked about <em>cancel culture</em> – or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I&nbsp;will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”</p> <p>This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very&nbsp;exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.</p> <p>Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/26/patricia-lockwood-poem-rape-joke\">Rape Joke</a>, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.</p> <p>In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born with <a href=\"https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/proteus-syndrome/\">Proteus syndrome</a>, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”</p>    <p>In the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.</p> <p>Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”</p> <p>Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”</p> <p>The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”</p> <p>On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”</p> <p><em>• Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.</p> <p>The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/florian-wirtz-liverpool-newcastle-nick-woltemade-gambling-philipp-lahm\">Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp Lahm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friend Donald Trump.</p> <p>Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar\">I feel like a concerned black African football tourist</a>. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.</p> <p>You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.</p> <p>But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.</p> <p>It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.</p>    <p>And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.</p> <p>This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/01/cristiano-ronaldo-faces-us1bn-lawsuit-for-promoting-binance-nfts\">collapsed into legal chaos</a>, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.</p> <p>What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.</p> <p>Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/04/us-court-to-hear-arguments-over-payment-in-cristiano-ronaldo-allegation-case\">no-admission no-guilt payoff</a> to make the whole thing stop.</p> <p>The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.</p>    <p>And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.</p> <p>Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).</p> <p>And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.</p> <p>For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.</p> <p>Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.</p> <p>He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.</p>    <p>For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.</p> <p>Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.</p> <p>What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.</p> <p>This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.</p> <p>Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn’t been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.</p> <p>There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America’s public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the Guardian University Guide 2026. It can feel like it’s all change in universities these days – exams are increasingly a thing of the past, you can tune into lectures online, and now there’s the tricky business of working out whether ChatGPT is your studying friend or foe.</p> <p>This year’s guide will help you understand how technology is reshaping the university experience, and how to make the most of it – from landing a place on a course you love, to getting ready for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>The Guardian rankings will help you figure out which universities give their students the best experience, rather than just showing you which are strongest in academic research, like most other league tables.</p> <p>We rank universities through eight different scores, which form a total out of 100. These include what students say about their teaching and feedback in the annual National Student Survey.</p> <p>We also look at how big class sizes are through the student-to-staff ratio and how much universities spend on teaching each student. Other areas covered are students’ A-level grades and whether their academic performance improves at university (the value-added score), and how likely they are to persevere with their course. There’s also data on how many students get graduate jobs 15 months after leaving university. For each metric, we use the most recent data available at the time of publication. Any blank spaces mean there is data missing, so we focus on the other measures.</p> <p>In the guide, you will find our overall league table of UK universities as well as individual subject profiles and tables. This year, we have a special table showing you the universities and courses that graduates were least likely to regret. We’ve also got lots of advice to help you make up your mind and start planning for university, from how to take advantage of clearing to which universities offer a buzzing student nightlife.</p> <p>The rankings change annually, and some universities may benefit from temporary measures such as funding boosts or changes to their student intake. Don’t forget that universities languishing at the bottom of the overall table can be top for certain subjects – so check out our subject tables and profiles to build up a full picture.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Exclusive: A third of those polled do not tell bosses about use of tools and half think AI threatens the social structure</p>",
    "content": "<p>It is the work shortcut that dare not speak its name. A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.</p> <p>Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.</p> <p>Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.</p> <p>The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.</p> <p>Next week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess\">state visit to the UK</a> by Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.</p> <p>The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/dhanushi-lost-her-job-the-same-day-cba-rolled-out-an-ai-chatbot-it-may-just-be-the-beginning\">‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743\">has said</a> he wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p> <p>The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01901-x\">US study</a> circulated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.</p> <p>Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.</p> <p>“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”</p> <p>A study by the Henley Business School in May found 49% of workers reported there were no formal guidelines for AI use in their workplace and more than a quarter felt their employer did not offer enough support.</p> <p>Prof Keiichi Nakata at the school said people were more comfortable about being transparent in their use of AI than 12 months earlier but “there are still some elements of AI shaming and some stigma associated with AI”.</p> <p>He said: “Psychologically, if you are confident with your work and your expertise you can confidently talk about your engagement with AI, whereas if you feel it might be doing a better job than you are or you feel that you will be judged as not good enough or worse than AI, you might try to hide that or avoid talking about it.”</p> <p>OpenAI’s head of solutions engineering for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Matt Weaver, said: “We’re seeing huge demand from business leaders for company-wide AI rollouts – because they know using AI well isn’t a shortcut, it’s a skill. Leaders see the gains in productivity and knowledge sharing and want to make that available to everyone.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mille Colling and Emma Aalto given go-ahead to compete in qualifier for national championships next month</p>",
    "content": "<p>A British ice dancer and her skating partner are to become Finland’s first same-sex team to take part in a competition after a rule change by the country’s skating federation.</p> <p>Millie Colling, 20, who was born in Gateshead and moved to Finland at the age of six, and Emma Aalto, 19, will compete in a qualifier for the national championships next month after pressing for an amendment to the rules to allow them to enter as a team.</p> <p>The pair said they were “best friends that want to skate together”. Their request was supported by their coach, Neil Brown, who helped persuade the skating federation to agree new rules, referring to ice dance partners as Skater A and Skater B instead of man and woman.</p> <p>Colling, an art student, enrolled at skating school a year after her family moved to Finland, and Aalto, a fashion student, has been skating since she was five years old. They met two years ago.</p> <p>“We were immediately on the same level, we really clicked,” said Colling. They began to skate together but “at that point we hadn’t seen any other same-gender skating teams”.</p> <p>But this year, the retired Olympic champions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/papadakis-hubbell-skate-together-promote-same-sex-pairs-competition-2025-02-06/\">Madison Hubbell and Gabriella Papadakis performed together</a>, hoping to help break gender stereotypes in the sport. Colling said: “It was completely new and we were, whoa, OK.”</p>    <p>It was a “common misconception” that same-sex teams were gay or in a relationship, she added. “There are lots of queer athletes, and we really admire them. But it’s not the case that in order to be in a non-traditional team you have to be queer.”</p> <p>Aalto said: “The point is to be opening possibilities for everyone, not just for queer people.” Ice dancing with a same-sex partner was “not necessarily any different”, she said.</p> <p>Colling added: “One of us leads, one follows, one lifts, one of us is lifted. We have quite similar body mass, so technically there are some differences, but we still do the same content.”</p> <p>“Every partnership is different,” said Aalto. “Every couple has their own strengths and weaknesses, and their programmes are built around those strengths and weaknesses. Ice dance is a really individual sport – each couple is unique, and we’re just another unique couple.”</p> <p>If the duo qualify, they would be unable to take part in the national competition in December, as that requires further changes. “The federation has said we can’t do it yet – but fingers crossed for the future,” Colling said.</p> <p>The pair hope their participation in the qualifier will be a strong signal of change to the ice dance community and the public. They do not expect to win – “we’re just excited to get out there”, Colling said.</p> <p>They said they felt free and happy while skating. “You stop being a normal version of yourself. You can be whatever you want on the ice,” Aalto said. “It’s the best feeling – it feels like home.”</p>",

Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Christopher Atkinson, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Joshua Oliver with arson following a police investigation into a fire at the offices of Sharon Hodgson MP.</p> <p>“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with Northumbria police as they carried out their investigation.”</p> <p>Oliver, of no fixed address, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Saturday. The CPS urged people not to share information online that could prejudice the legal proceedings.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. After the fire, a spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p>",

She watches her friends do what she cannot and she carries it all inside with quiet strength.</p> <p>“This tragedy did not just change our daughter’s life, it broke something in us as a family. Every time we see her struggle, we ask ourselves why we came here and what we could have done differently. The guilt and helplessness are unbearable. For us, the trauma is relentless.</p> <p>“We live with constant fear about the future, unsure of how much more she will lose as she grows. We grieve for the dreams we once had for her: dreams of music, sport and a carefree childhood, all replaced by therapy sessions, hospital appointments and adaptions for survival.”</p> <p>She said the family was doing everything possible to show the girl that her life was “still full of possibilities” and to “make her smile”. “But the mental and emotional trauma we carry every day is heavy, a constant fear for her future and a constant grief for the life she lost and the life we imagined as a family,” she added.</p> <p>During a three-week trial, Riley was asked to identify the “third party” who had recruited him for about £40,000. He refused, citing fear for his life and for his family.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has offered up to £15,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person who fired the shots.</p> <p>DCI Joanna Yorke, who led the investigation, said: “The dangerous man responsible for pulling the trigger is walking free, and it is imperative we find him. People out there know what happened and are choosing to stay quiet. We understand that you may be worried about talking to us, but it is vital we hear from anyone who can assist this investigation.</p> <p>“Please reconsider your decision to stay silent and share what you know. Anything you say will be treated with the utmost care and confidentiality and you will be playing a huge part in securing justice for a young girl and her family.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A<strong> </strong>week of mass actions protesting against the ban on Palestine Action has been announced, beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool and culminating in a national mobilisation in Parliament Square in London on 4 October.</p> <p>The plans were announced by Defend Our Juries on Friday, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">857 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act</a> at a demonstration outside parliament opposing the proscription. It said the next phase of the protests represented a “major escalation” that would create an “unprecedented challenge” for the police, with 1,100 people already registered to take part and risk arrest.</p> <p>“There should be no confusion about where the blame lies: it sits squarely with the government for pursuing this authoritarian ban, plunging an overstretched police force and court and prison systems which are already in crisis, into further chaos,” a spokesperson said. “The power lies with the new home secretary to end this farce by listening to MPs, lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/yvette-cooper-plan-ban-palestine-action-un-experts-lawyers\">UN experts, legal professionals</a>, human rights advocates – and the majority of her own party’s members – and lift this dangerous, anti-democratic ban.”</p> <p>They accused the prime minister, Keir Starmer, of “grotesque double standards” for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/04/israel-president-visit-london-talks-ministers-isaac-herzog\">meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, this week</a>, while people had been arrested for holding cardboard signs in support of Palestine Action. They said it made people “even more determined to do whatever it takes to overturn this unjust ban, including by targeting Starmer’s upcoming conference”.</p> <p>Protests at the party conference, which begins on 28 September, will be an unwelcome distraction for the prime minister as he attempts to address Labour’s slump in the polls.</p> <p>Defend Our Juries launched a new call for people across the country to show their defiance by placing a sign saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” – the same wording people have brandished on placards at the demonstrations – in their front windows. It follows a viral video of a former Labour councillor, Keith Hackett, being <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/4e7ddf31-b481-4179-81f6-5af95e1633ff\">told by police</a> he could legally display a poster in support of Palestine Action because it was “not in public”.</p> <p>Last Saturday’s demonstration was the second major protest organised by Defend Our Juries in defiance of the ban. Defend Our Juries claimed there were 1,500 people holding signs saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” and that the police’s failure to arrest everyone showed they were overwhelmed.</p> <p>At the previous demonstration, last month, 532 people were arrested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/10/police-arrest-hundreds-london-protest-over-palestine-action-ban\">half of whom were aged 60 or above</a>. A spokesperson claimed opposition to the ban, the first of a direct action protest group, was “growing at an exponential rate”.</p> <p>The then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/yvette-cooper-vows-ban-palestine-action-anti-terrorism-laws\">announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action</a> in June, three days after it claimed responsibility for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, although it later emerged that she was advised to proscribe the group in March. She said the group, which targeted organisations it claimed were complicit in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians, had a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and was a threat to national security.</p> <p>Since the ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails\">came into force on 5 July</a>, more than 1,600 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, including vicars, priests, doctors, former government advisers, army veterans, and many elderly and disabled people. The figure is more than were previously arrested during the entire “war on terror” <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-tact-2000-to-june-2025/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-and-subsequent-legislation-arrests-outcomes-and-stop-and-search-great-britain-quarterly-u\">since 2001</a>.</p> <p>Most have not been charged, although seven people appeared in court last week accused of being organisers of the demonstrations.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Trades Union Congress annual congress unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to repeal the proscription of Palestine Action.</p> <p>The president of the civil servants’ union said the ban represented a “significant abuse of counter-terrorist powers and a direct attack on our right to protest against the genocidal Israeli regime”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dale Vince wants ministers to ‘optimise’ resources in fossil fuel basin to help smooth transition to renewables</p>",
    "content": "<p>One of Britain’s leading green industrialists has called on the government to offer subsidies to North Sea oil companies to help support a “just transition” to renewables that protects energy industry workers.</p> <p>Dale Vince, a Labour donor, urged ministers to “optimise” the remaining resources of the declining oil basin as the UK reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">banned new North Sea oil and gas projects</a>.</p> <p>The founder of Ecotricity spoke out a week after his fellow green entrepreneur Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/27/octopus-energy-founder-greg-jackson-given-cabinet-office-role-to-help-shape-future-policies\">a Cabinet Office adviser</a>, backed calls to restart North Sea drilling.</p> <p>The Labour party swept to power in 2024 with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">halt new drilling licences in the North Sea</a>, and it plans to keep the windfall tax imposed during rocketing oil and gas prices in place until 2030.</p> <p>Vince said the government should scrap the windfall tax and instead offer subsidies to oil companies that guarantee a minimum price for the barrels of oil and gas they produce.</p> <p>“Our North Sea is in decline, let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left,” he said. “It’s time for Labour to put its arms around the North Sea and support operators with existing licences. Putting fossil fuels on an equal footing with renewables by giving them a stable price is the key to a just transition.”</p>    <p>Offshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea industry, declined to comment on whether Vince’s proposals would be welcomed by oil and gas companies. A government spokesperson said the proposal was “not under consideration. We are driving forward our mission to become a clean energy superpower, to cut bills for good.”</p> <p>They added: “We are delivering a fair and orderly transition in the North Sea to drive growth and secure tens of thousands of skilled jobs, with the biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first-of-a-kind carbon capture and storage clusters.”</p> <p>Jackson said last week that relying on North Sea oil and gas would have a smaller climate impact than relying on costly imports from the US and the Middle East, which release more emissions during production and transportation than homegrown fossil fuels.</p> <p>“When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas,” Jackson told the Telegraph. “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”</p> <p>The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there needed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist#:~:text=Fatih%20Birol%2C%20the%20IEA's%20executive,now%20%E2%80%93%20from%20this%20year.%E2%80%9D\">no new fossil fuel projects</a> if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>However, the global energy watchdog later clarified that continued investment in existing oil and gas supply would be “essential” in a net zero scenario to ensure that oil and gas supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand.</p> <p>The green industry leaders’ comments on the North Sea come amid growing pressure from opposition parties to back the industry, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">supports about 130,000 jobs</a> and contributed more than £6bn in tax receipts to the government in the last financial year and £9bn the year before.</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the party would aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/30/tories-would-maximise-north-sea-oil-and-gas-extraction-badenoch-expected-to-say\">to “maximise extraction”</a> of oil and gas in the North Sea if it won the next election. Reform UK has also promised to reverse Labour’s ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/23/reform-uk-promise-to-reverse-ban-on-north-sea-oil-drilling-if-elected\">as a “day one” priority</a> if it comes to power.</p> <p>The Guardian reported over the summer that senior government advisers had told North Sea investors that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">new drilling could still move ahead</a> despite the election promise to ban it, provided the projects were close to existing pipeline infrastructure and did not extend into “greenfield” areas.</p> <p>“Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” one energy investor said.</p> <p>The source said that while Treasury officials were open to considering future North Sea oil and gas projects, the plans were unlikely to be well received by Ed Miliband, the secretary of state of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p> <p>Miliband reportedly refused to leave his post in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle last week. ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, who first reported the claims, said it was “one part of the reshuffle that didn’t quite go Starmer’s way”.</p> <p>• The headline and introductory text of this article were amended on 11 September 2025 to clarify what Dale Vince is urging the government to do. We regret that an earlier version said he was calling on the government “to allow new North Sea oil and gas projects”; in fact, he was calling for a guaranteed minimum price for the oil and gas produced by existing North Sea fields.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/ukraine-amputee-veterans-disability-war-invasion-daniel-melnyk-marta-syrko\">military personnel who have been seriously injured</a> in the three-year war against Russia.</p> <p>During the trip to the Ukrainian capital, he and a team from his Invictus Games Foundation are set to detail new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded, with the eventual aim of providing help to all areas of the country.</p> <p>Earlier this year it was estimated that the Ukraine war had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/kyiv-league-of-the-mighty-how-amputee-football-supports-ukraine-survivors\">Kyiv’s League of the Mighty: how amputee football supports Ukraine’s survivors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian on an overnight train to the capital, the Duke of Sussex said: “We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.”</p> <p>He added: “We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”</p>    <p>The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded amputees. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/10/prince-harry-makes-unannounced-visit-to-wounded-veterans-in-ukraine\">visited the centre in April</a>, but met her by chance a couple of months ago in the US.</p> <p>“I bumped into Olga in New York. It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said ‘the biggest impact you have is coming to Kyiv’. I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.</p> <p>“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”</p> <p>Ukraine first took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/invictus-games\">Invictus Games</a> in 2017, but enthusiasm and need for the competition, which was founded by the Prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.</p> <p>The Duke remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.</p>    <p>“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out. Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield. It means so much to us, because it means so much to them.”</p> <p>During the trip, the Prince is due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He is expected to spend time with 200 veterans, who have also been invited. He is also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.</p> <p>Travelling to Kyiv would give him a chance to talk to veterans, and also see some of the destruction first-hand, he said. While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.</p> <p>Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become “a key function in veterans’ healthcare.</p> <p>“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy.”</p> <p>By March this year, more than 22,000 veterans across Ukraine had accessed benefits like gym memberships and pool passes.</p> <p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Bride finally tracks down awkward-looking stranger she and husband noticed only when looking through photos</p>",
    "content": "<p>A baffled bride has solved the mystery of the awkward-looking stranger who crashed her wedding four years ago.</p> <p>Michelle Wylie and her husband, John, registered the presence of their unidentifiable guest only as they looked through photographs of their wedding in the days after the happy occasion.</p> <p>Who was the tall man in a dark suit, distinguished by the look of quiet mortification on his face? But their family and friends could offer no explanation, nor could hotel staff at the Carlton hotel in Prestwick, where the event took place in November 2021. An appeal on Facebook likewise yielded no clues.</p> <p>Eventually, with the mystery still niggling, Wylie asked the popular Scottish content creator Dazza to cast the online net wider – and a sheepish Andrew Hillhouse finally stepped forward.</p> <p>In his explanatory post on Facebook, Hillhouse admitted that he had been “cutting it fine, as I’m known to do” when he pulled up at the wedding venue with five minutes to spare. Spotting a piper and other guests, he followed them into the hotel – “I remember thinking to myself: ‘Cool, this is obviously the right place’” – unaware that he had the address completely wrong and was supposed to be at a ceremony 2 miles away in Ayr.</p>    <p>He was initially unperturbed to find himself surrounded by strangers as the ceremony began – at the marriage he was due to attend, the only person he knew was the bride, Michaela, while his partner, Andrew, was part of the wedding party. It was when an entirely different bride came walking down the aisle that he realised: “OMG that’s not Michaela … I was at the wrong wedding!”</p> <p>Hillhouse said: “You can’t exactly stand up and walk out of a wedding mid-ceremony, so I just had to commit to this act and spent the next 20 minutes awkwardly sitting there trying to be as inconspicuous as my 6ft 2 ass could be.”</p> <p>At the end of the ceremony, Hillhouse, who is from Troon, was hoping to make a discreet exit, only to be waylaid by the wedding photographer, who insisted he join other guests for a group shot. He can be spotted looming uncomfortably at the very back of the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/02/paris-startup-invitin-app-selling-strangers-invites-to-weddings\">‘As if we’re real guests’: the startup selling strangers invitations to weddings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His post continued: “Rushed outside, made some phone calls and made my way to the correct wedding, where I was almost as popular as the actual bride and groom, and spent most of the night retelling that story to people.”</p> <p>For Michelle Wylie, this amiable resolution brings to a close years of speculation.</p>    <p>She told BBC Scotland: “It would come into my head and I’d be like: ‘Someone must know who this guy is.’ I said a few times to my husband: ‘Are you sure you don’t know this guy, is he maybe from your work?’ We wondered if he was a mad stalker.”</p> <p>She is now Facebook friends with Hillhouse and the pair have met in person to cement their coincidental bond.</p> <p>“I could not stop laughing,” said Wylie. “We can’t believe we’ve found out who he is after almost four years.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p> <p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p> <p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\" data-alt=\"a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile.</p> <p>The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further.</p> <p>“Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.”</p> <p>The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London.</p> <p>Business groups have blamed Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution</a>, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business.</p> <p>Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade.</p> <p>“The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.”</p> <p>The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.</p> <p>However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence.</p> <p>Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.”</p> <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on.</p> <p>“Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.”</p> <p>Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed.</p> <p>The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">jumped to 3.8% in July</a>, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.</p> <p>Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.</p>",

Inland areas will also experience stormy weather, with most of England and Wales experiencing 45mph to 55mph gusts.</p> <p>Delays to transport are likely, along with a slight risk of injuries and danger to life from flying debris, the forecaster added.</p> <p>Stephen Kocher, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said that from Sunday, strong west or southwesterly winds would arrive at coastal areas in south-west England and Wales then spread inland.</p> <p>The Met Office said the weather had been caused by a deepening area of low pressure travelling eastwards across the Atlantic.</p> <p>While there has been speculation that the weekend’s weather will bring the first named storm of the season – expected to be Storm Amy – the Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said on Friday that there was currently no plan to name the storm.</p> <p>“Obviously we are in meteorological autumn now; it’s the sort of weather that we do expect at this time of year,” he said. “So it’s nothing unusual, particularly – perhaps it’s just the contrast with the weather that we have enjoyed over most of the summer.”</p> <p>The Met Office has advised those in the alert area to prepare by protecting their property, including securing loose outdoor items such as bins, sheds, fences and garden furniture.</p> <p>There will be a brief reprieve from the intense weather on Tuesday but Madge warned that more severe gales could hit exposed coastal areas again on Wednesday. He said it was too early to tell where the impact would be but that it would be less severe than the winds arriving on Sunday.</p> <p>“Drivers are really going to feel the effects of the early autumnal weather this weekend,” said Rod Dennis, a spokesperson for the RAC breakdown service.</p> <p>“This will particularly be the case later on Sunday and into the new working week – strong gusty winds will make driving conditions challenging across a large swathe of southern and western Britain.</p> <p>“The wind will be particularly noticeable on more exposed roads, like those over the moors in Devon and Cornwall, so drivers may like to delay their journeys or seek other routes.</p> <p>“We urge anyone setting out to reduce their speeds while driving and pass high-sided vehicles with particular care.”</p> <p>Sunshine and drier conditions are most likely to be found in the east, though temperatures will remain on the cooler side, with highs of about 17C to 18C expected in London on Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/mps-asda-app-loans-wagestream",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Retailer’s owner has stake in Wagestream, which offers workers loans of up to £25,000</p>",
    "content": "<p>An influential group of MPs has sought assurances that Asda is not “squeezing staff” to drive profit after it emerged they are being offered high-interest loans by Wagestream, a company in which the retailer’s owner has a stake.</p> <p>The business and trade select committee has written to Asda over its links to the “financial wellbeing app” that recently began offering the supermarket’s staff loans of up to £25,000. The default arrangements for Wagestream’s “workplace loans” involve debt repayments being directly deducted from workers’ pay packets.</p> <p> A holding company controlled by Asda’s private equity owner TDR Capital is a shareholder in Wagestream, which has been offering Asda workers a range of other services, including savings pots and wage advances, since 2023.</p> <p>Documents filed at Companies House show that the holding company, Bellis Financial Investments 2, is one of a number of shareholders in Wagestream, alongside former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital, and social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund.</p> <p>However, the Guardian understands that the retailer did not flag its financial link to Wagestream to staff when it initially launched the service to workers two years ago. Wagestream – which this week rebranded itself as Stream – started offering “workplace loans” to Asda staff earlier this year.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade committee, said he had written to Asda “to ask them to reassure us that frontline workers aren’t left facing sky-high interest rates, and that its workplace lending is compliant with Asda’s legal requirements under employment law”.</p> <p>“Asda is one of Britain’s most important employers with over 150,000 workers and is at the heart of our grocery market,” he said. </p> <p>“Our concern today is that instead of easing Asda’s debts, its parent company may<strong> </strong>be piling pressure on Asda’s people – squeezing staff to service liabilities and drive profit to its financial investments. If this is the case, it raises serious questions as to Asda’s responsible stewardship, and the long-term financial sustainability of the business as a whole.”</p> <p>Asda’s finance director, Michael Gleeson, told the committee in 2023 that a £100m investment in Wagestream and two other financial services businesses had been funded out of proceeds from the £1.7bn sale of Asda’s warehouses, which the company now has to pay rent on under a leaseback deal. “We are part owners of each of those three companies,” he told MPs. Bellis is understood to hold a 4% stake in Wagestream.</p> <p>Asda said it does not pay Wagestream for any services or receive any financial benefit if a member of staff chooses to use the app. However, as a shareholder, Asda’s parent group has a direct interest in its success and would have the right to a share of any future dividend payments or proceeds from the sale of the group.</p> <p>Wagestream is yet to pay a dividend and remains loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in 2024.</p> <p>That could change before long, however, with revenues having grown by more than two-thirds (64%) to £36.9m last year, when it handed out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn.</p> <p>The rollout of workplace loans could propel earnings, which have so far relied on fees linked to its wage advance product. Wagestream said a rise in revenues in the upcoming year would probably outpace costs and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Asda, which is the UK’s third largest supermarket, said: “Asda offers colleagues access to a range of established financial products through a partner regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These include salary advances, workplace loans and savings products paying a competitive interest rate of 4.33%, which is currently used by more than 18,000 colleagues.</p> <p>“Many other large employers, including all of Asda’s direct competitors in the grocery sector, offer similar products to their employees through the same or competitor providers.”</p> <p>Asda added that all applications for Wagestream’s workplace loans were subject to “robust affordability checks” before being approved. “At present, fewer than 2% of Asda colleagues have taken out a loan. The representative APR on these loans is 13.9%.”</p> <p>Wagestream began rolling out the loans to clients including Asda at the end of 2024. Those loans come with a representative APR of between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.</p> <p>But the ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its model still saves borrowers an average of £593 a loan, with customers having been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the app.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said it was concerned about the financial links between Asda and Wagestream: “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that TDR has a financial interest in the app that facilitates Asda workers taking these financial risks, while also being the overall decision-maker for how much these workers are paid and the hours they are able to work.”</p> <p>“We now find out that Wagestream is offering dangerous loans at high interest rates and GMB members working in Asda tell us they have used the app to take advances on their pay, which can contribute to a cycle of debt.</p> <p>“The bottom line is that employers should pay workers enough to live on, to have savings and to not need to rely on dangerous high-interest loans or advances on their pay just to cover day-to-day living costs.”</p> <p>Wagestream said in a statement that “as a regulated financial services provider, Wagestream has a conflicts of interest policy and has implemented processes to review and monitor conflicts of interest to comply with FCA rules.”</p> <p>“TDR Capital’s holding in Wagestream does not create a conflict as it falls well below the thresholds set out by the FCA. As a minority shareholder, TDR Capital does not have operational or day-to-day control of any of Wagestream’s undertakings,” the statement added.</p> <p>Wagestream said it considers potential conflicts when deciding on whether to partner with employers, which in turn sign its terms and conditions that require good consumer outcomes and transparency, including around fees.</p> <p>TDR declined to comment.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/digested-week-marsupial-brings-cheer-in-dark-and-dysfunctional-days",
    "description": "<p>It was left to a – albeit extinct – tiny relative of the kangaroo to offer some relief from the blizzard of major events</p>",
    "content": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Where to start in a week so fraught with major events you could hardly draw breath for the news flashes? It started with Trump’s alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book,” shared by the Democrats on social media on Monday and leading to the discovery of a name not widely recognised in the US but of intense interest in the UK – Peter Mandelson. The British ambassador to the US had proffered an undiplomatically warm birthday message to the late child sex offender financier, starting a press scramble that ended, on Thursday, with Keir Starmer firing him.</p> <p>That was just the beginning. As Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Nato jets, forecasts of a third world war gained pace and in the US, Charlie Kirk, a rightwing political activist, was assassinated in front of a crowd in Utah. Another firing followed: at MSNBC, the analyst Matthew Dowd was swiftly booted for suggesting that Kirk, who had a history of making racist and sexist remarks, had learned the hard way that, “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”. On the Christian right, meanwhile, Kirk instantly rose to the status of an American martyr.</p> <p>If it was a week in which America looked, once again, like an increasingly dysfunctional and unhappy place and Europe slid towards darker days, it was left to Australia to cheer us, which it did with – what else? – the discovery of a new marsupial: a tiny, previously unknown relative of the kangaroo, a sort of mouse-wallaby hybrid species of “bettong”, identified by its fossil remains because, in keeping with the general state of the world and because we can’t have nice things, it turns out it is already extinct.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Also extinct (almost): that species of lovable eccentric billionaire who stays out of politics and spends his cash on decommissioned Soviet fighter jets and a luxury car collection. In other words, Larry Ellison, the 90s playboy and founder of Oracle with the lustrous, tan-coloured mane to make Elon Musk weep. At the turn of the millennium Ellison was the world’s richest man, long since eclipsed by the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos, but like all things from the 90s he’s back with a vengeance and this week, after Oracle’s stock price soared, once again took the top spot.</p> <p>Per the business pages, Oracle’s shares soared owing to a “rosy outlook for [the company’s] cloud infrastructure business and AI deals”. I’m more interested in revisiting the greatest hits of a billionaire whose biographer, Mike Wilson, once described as “a one-man amusement park, Larryland.” To wit: Ellison flying his Marchetti S.211 fighter plane in mock dog fights over the Pacific with his son, David; winning the Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 with a young Lachlan Murdoch onboard; and my favourite Ellison flourish, what was said to be his favourite chat-up line of the 90s – “Can I buy you a car?”</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>More news from Australia that is almost as charming as a marsupial: Russell Crowe (I know, he’s originally from New Zealand), gussied up in a Nazi uniform and gone the full Brando in the trailer for Nuremberg. Crowe plays Hermann Göring, who at the time of his capture apparently weighed 280 pounds and was described by an allied soldier who witnessed it as a “huge bulk”, an acting challenge to which Crowe appears to have magnificently risen. The forthcoming movie co-stars Rami Malek, Michael Shannon and Leo Woodall, but clearly this is Rusty’s picture. His German accent – “I vill have, as you say, my day I court” – is worth the ticket price alone and appears to be a combo of ‘Allo ‘Allo!’s Gestapo corps and, as Crowe once said of his accent in Gladiator, “Royal Shakespeare Company three pints after lunch.” Bravo!</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The huge bulk of Emily’s saggy old cat, Bagpuss, is coming back in a new film to make gen X cry. For those not born in the 20th century, Bagpuss was an old cloth cat with pink stripes and piercing blue eyes, who lived in a shop for lost and found items with his friends Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the doll and the mice on the mouse organ (“Heave! Heave!). News of the reboot this week sent me straight to YouTube to watch the opening sequence of Oliver Postgate’s TV show, broadcast in the mid- to late-70s on repeat and almost unbearably poignant, not least because it’s narrated in an accent that no longer exists.</p> <p>Bagpuss (“The most important, the most beautiful, the most magical, saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world”) is embedded in the earliest TV memories of those of us who were kids at the time and, having a moment at my screen, I called over my 10-year-old to share in the magic. She watched for 20 seconds, said, “Boring!”, patted me sympathetically on the arm and walked off. “Baggy and a bit loose at the seams,” I murmured in unison with Postgate, “but Emily loved him.”</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Prince Harry met the king in London this week after an apparent estrangement of 19 months and, according to those monitoring the arrival and departure of the prince’s car, the audience lasted 54 minutes. But that’s a generous interpretation of the actual face time involved in the “private tea”, which, allowing for entrance and egress through Clarence House, settling in and waiting time, surely came out closer to half an hour. Did Harry whip out his phone and show his father photos of the two grandchildren he’s spent almost no time with? Did the king ask about Meghan? Was it all about money? Was there ever a more pitiful sight than, generation after generation, the royal family’s cold and strained filial relations?</p>",

This increase was driven primarily by the services and construction sectors, but production output fell by 1.3%. However, growth is slowing in these sectors and is likely the result of actions taken by the Labour government now being realised, with the increase in employer national insurance contributions having a significant impact on business confidence. </p> <p>“With the summer now over and the economy supposedly getting out of its slumber, we now face continuing uncertainty in the lead up to the budget in November given the precarious position the Chancellor finds the public finances in. It is estimated that the fiscal hole that needs to be plugged is anywhere between £20bn and £50bn. While that is a wide range, it means one thing for a government that has shown it will struggle to cut spending – more tax rises. </p> <p>“Speculation is already rife about which taxes will be raised, and without the ability to raise the main revenue generators – income tax, national insurance and VAT – the government is left with targeting multiple sectors for small amounts of revenue. This is increasing the headwinds for the UK economy and with still over two months to go, GDP readings for the second half of the year are unlikely to pretty reading. For government under as much pressure as it is at the moment, this will be a very difficult corner to get itself out of.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c3b9418f0880bae9c51f37\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-12T06:13:58.536Z\">7.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chart: three monthly GDP growth slowed again in July</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a chart showing how growth has slowed, when looking at GDP over a three-month period:</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c3b8de8f086519d32706bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-12T06:09:10.929Z\">7.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ONS: production sector is falling back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>ONS </strong>director of economic statistics<strong> Liz McKeown </strong>says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months.

Private sector wage growth is running at an average of 4.8%.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: “Someone happily accepting a pay package of £10.5m doesn’t really have the moral authority to tell nurses and teachers and local government workers they shouldn’t get a pay rise.</p> <p>“It would be a lot easier to fund decent wages for public sector workers if the wealth of multimillionaires was taxed more effectively, so if the Barclays CEO is concerned about the sustainability of public finances, he would look a lot less crass and hypocritical if he used his position to argue for a wealth tax on the super-rich instead.” </p> <p>Venkatakrishnan also said the banking sector should not be a target of further taxation. “UK banks are taxed more than banks anywhere else,” he said. “How much more are you going to squeeze this?”</p> <p>Banks are concerned that the industry’s reliable profits, fuelled by higher interest rates, could make it one of the targets for tax increases as Reeves comes under pressure to raise taxes to address a hole in her fiscal plans.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/29/uk-bank-shares-tumble-after-call-for-windfall-tax-on-lenders-in-budget\">UK bank shares tumbled</a>, cutting the combined market value of some of the biggest companies in the sector by more than £6bn, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the budget spooked investors.</p> <p>“I hope it’s an extremely low possibility,” said Venkatakrishnan. “London is a great global financial centre and the path to growth does not lie to taxing the sector even more. I have had the view from day one that this is a government that is pro business and particularly pro the financial industry.”</p> <p>He claimed the UK banks had, in effect, a total tax rate of about 46% last year, compared with 28% in New York and 29% to 39% in the EU.</p> <p>Barclays made £5.7bn in pre-tax profits last year in the UK, and paid almost £1.4bn in total tax. Of this, £198m was corporation tax and £154m for the bank levy.</p> <p>“What I hope and expect is that they will take this time to think through the difficult choices they have to make,” Venkatakrishnan said. “No budget keeps everyone happy, but the object of it is to foster growth in the country.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishan has been a vocal supporter of Reeves and the wider Labour government’s policies since it took power last summer, but has recently spoken out against proposals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/13/uk-bank-ringfencing-deregulation-financial-services-rachel-reeves\">change ringfencing rules</a> that force UK banks to separate their retail and riskier investment banking operations.</p>",

    "content": "<p>There is a “resilience and grit” that comes from being born in the north-east of England, says Fiona Hill, who went from a working-class childhood in County Durham to a top intelligence job at the heart of the White House.</p> <p>But, she believes, it is also a big reason why she and other notable high achievers have had the success they have. The secret of success could be being from the north-east.</p> <p>Hill has talked to a number of figures from – or with strong links to – the north-east for her new Forged in the North podcast series, which will be launched at <a href=\"https://newwritingnorth.com/event/fiona-hill-forged-in-the-north/\">Durham book festival in October</a>.</p> <p>They include two global figures originally from the same part of Wallsend: the Cramlington primary school teacher turned superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/22/the-last-ship-review-sting\">Sting</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/05/academicexperts.highereducationprofile\">the Yale historian Paul Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>“It’s basically just listening to two people who seem on the surface so completely different but have this common origin story,” says Hill.</p> <p>Other podcast guests are Lee Hall, the writer of Billy Elliot; Brendan Foster, the founder of the Great North Run; the north-east mayor, Kim McGuinness; the Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Sara Davies; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/03/oscar-conclave-peter-straughan-best-adapted-screenplay\">dramatist Peter Straughan</a>; and the Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p>Hill was born and brought up in Bishop Auckland, the daughter of a coalminer and a midwife. She and her accent went on to be a foreign affairs adviser to US presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump and she is considered one of the world’s leading experts on Russia and Putin.</p> <p>Last year she was named as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/19/labour-defence-adviser-fiona-hill\">three advisers to oversee the UK government’s strategic defence review</a>.</p> <p>The new series is born, Hill says, of a belief that “too much happens down in London, as if the rest of the country doesn’t exist”.</p> <p>The hope is to “put the spotlight on a region that is normally only in the headlines for something going wrong: child poverty, the lowest life expectancy, worst nutrition”, she says.</p> <p>“The north-east is home of the Industrial Revolution – literally the engines of prosperity. Two hundred years ago, it was the forefront of innovation, and we’re saying, there’s still a lot of potential for innovation.”</p> <p>Hill turns 60 this year and is planning a trip back to the north-east from her home in the US. She says: “I’ve always wanted to walk along a portion of Hadrian’s Wall, I want to go back up the Northumberland coast. I want to come back for all the stories and storytelling I remember as a kid from the region.”</p> <p>It was in this context that the idea of the podcast series came about, with the aim of telling stories about the north “not just how it was, but how it is and how it might be”.</p> <p>Many cultural figures have talked passionately about the importance of where they are from. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/bbc-to-be-unashamedly-hull-centric-during-city-year-in-cultural-spotlight\">Hull-born playwright Richard Bean once said</a>: “Thank God I wasn’t born in Guildford. Thank God I was born somewhere there is tragedy and comedy every other second.”</p> <p>Hill says coming from the north-east gives “a certain resilience and grit”. “Being from the north-east grounds you, it’s an anchor, a solid base with a strong sense of what’s right and wrong and a clear perspective and values.”</p> <p>She points to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52269-how-strong-are-regional-identities-in-britain\">a recent poll</a> revealing how people from the north-east have a stronger attachment to their region than other parts of England. “There’s a sense of solidarity that’s been forged in adversity. Everyone’s thrown all kinds of rubbish at the north historically … but it has a resilience.”</p> <p>The importance of investing in people while they are young is a theme of the podcast discussions, says Hill, who got a grant from the Durham Miners’ Association to take a Russian language course to pursue her ambition to go to university.</p> <p>Straughan and Hall got started with enterprise grants and through locally funded theatres. Interestingly, McGuinness and Davies, both younger interviewees, say they had to make their own luck, with Davies using her savings to start her successful business.</p> <p>McGuinness says the series resonated with her ambition for the north-east to be a cultural powerhouse. “This important podcast shines a light on how with the right support, talent can truly thrive.</p> <p>“Funding in our region’s art sector has been outpaced by the south for some time. I’m determined to fix that cultural chasm and the cycle of regional inequality, positioning the north-east as a strong contender in the UK economy.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Instead of making silly statements the government needs to look at why Merck has scrapped its £1bn research centre</p>",
    "content": "<p>Compare and contrast. Here is the opening line in the government’s response to news that the US pharmaceutical company Merck is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapping its £1bn research centre</a> in King’s Cross in London because it thinks the UK is not an internationally competitive venue. Whistling cheerfully, the Department for Science, Technology and Innovation managed to claim: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world.”</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">here is Sir John Bell</a>, former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and all-round grand guru of life sciences in the UK. He told Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> <p>Who to believe? Frankly, the government’s boast is absurd. As anybody who follows the pharma sector knows, the big multinational firms are all obsessing over precisely the issues identified by Bell.</p> <p>The first is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">the amount of money the UK spends on medicines</a>: 9% of its healthcare budget, versus 17% in Germany and Italy and 15% in France. The second is the “clawback” mechanism that caps the NHS’s spending on prescription medicines. The formula last year spat out a figure of 23% to be recouped from firms, whereas equivalent European schemes tend to be in single digits. Such out-of-line ratios deter investment, goes the industry’s argument.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">What is the row between Wes Streeting and pharmaceutical companies about?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One possible reaction is to say big pharma makes big profits and the government is only doing its job if it tries to drive a hard bargain on drug prices. Another is to point out that the UK still has excellent long-term research and development infrastructure – world-class labs, universities, pots of public money for manufacturing – that even the most commercially minded pharma company ought to view separately from a quarrel over the price the NHS pays for medicines.</p> <p>Sadly, real life is not so simple. The Trump factor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/27/tough-talk-from-streeting-but-he-still-needs-a-deal-with-big-pharma\">as described in this column</a> a couple of weeks ago, has changed the dynamic. The president is demanding that US drug prices fall towards European levels; thus the companies do not want the UK, which has traditionally been able to force some of the lowest prices among rich European countries, to be used as a reference point. One can accuse the drugmakers of being ruthless or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">shortsighted</a>, but the cold reality is that they choose where to invest. The Merck example suggests that the mood is genuinely hardening.</p> <p>The company is not a fly-by-night operator. It has been in the UK for almost a century and is a big commercial presence in the Francis Crick Institute, one of those pieces of valuable infrastructure that, supposedly, was meant to tie firms into the UK. Government ministers comforted themselves that Merck is keeping 1,600 jobs in the UK and will continue to run clinical trials here. But the lifeblood of the life sciences is new investment. Merck is pulling the plug on a building that is half-built; other companies’ investments that, invisibly, don’t happen are just as damaging over time.</p> <p>As previously argued, one can sympathise with Wes Streeting, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">who walked away from price negotiations</a> by the pharma trade body last month. He inherited tensions that are a decade old and the new US factor has raised the stakes massively. Then there is the complication of official “value for money” criteria for new medicines that have not changed since 2001 (the industry’s other big complaint). The backdrop is the Treasury’s budget constraints. There is no easy answer.</p> <p>But a good first step would be to stop officials making silly statements about the UK being the best place in the world to invest. Yes, there are underlying strengths – the ministerial pitch about the UK becoming “a life sciences superpower” isn’t completely dreamy. But Bell is right when he says “without large companies, it isn’t going to work”. At the moment, it isn’t working.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from Rachel Reeves.</p> <p>Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job.</p> <p>The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">Growth flatlined in July</a>, slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year.</p> <p>Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers.</p> <p>Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/retail-sales-rise-but-ons-apologises-as-statistics-crisis-deepens\">decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025</a> women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services.</p> <p>The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds.</p> <p>Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment.</p> <p>As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances.</p> <p>Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/uk-hit-by-fresh-sell-off-in-government-bond-markets-as-pound-weakens\">Bond market investors</a> are watching closely.</p> <p>Among the big concerns is that speculation over the tax changes in the budget will dampen business activity over the coming months, even before November arrives, in a carbon copy of Labour’s first months back in office last year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power.</p> <p>On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/29/imf-global-growth-forecast-trump-tariffs-eu-trade-us\">International Monetary Fund</a> – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges.</p> <p>Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.</p>",

The surcharge could apply to 4,000 large retail outlets, according to the British Retail Consortium, which represents most large retail groups.</p> <p>The BRC looked at how a similar level of increased costs had affected retail businesses in the past to estimate how many of sites might be forced to close under the planned tax change. It concluded that 400 big stores could close. It said retailers might also raise prices or cut jobs in order to protect their profits.</p> <p>Some of the potentially affected retail outlets are so-called anchor tenants, big retailers that play a key role in attracting visitors to high streets and shopping centres, and driving trade to nearby cafes, pubs and other retailers.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Britain’s largest shops are magnets, pulling people into high streets, shopping centres and retail parks, supporting thousands of surrounding cafes, restaurants and smaller and independent shops.

That’s why growth is our number one mission.”</p> <p>The chancellor indicated that the government was considering changes to business rates to tackle so called “cliff edges”, which can lead to a leap in taxes when a small business wants to expand.</p> <p>Her comments accompanied an interim report on government plans for business rate changes, published on Thursday, which included changing the way rates were calculated and improving support for investment in premises.</p> <p>Kate Nicholls, the chair of the UKHospitality, which represents thousands of restaurants, pubs and cafes, said: “For too long, the broken business rates system has unfairly punished hospitality businesses and I’m pleased that the government is taking action to reform it.</p> <p>“These measures to remove punitive cliff-edges and barriers to investment are positive and will help to rebalance the system, as will the government’s commitment to lower business rates bills for hospitality businesses.”</p>",

He has this gorgeous velvet cape with a jewelled trim and he’s wearing a Spanish real, a coin, around his neck, and this metal gorget [covering the throat], which glints.</p> <p>“I think spending time dwelling on those details is really rewarding and there’s also this amazing unknowable quality about his face. He’s almost holding something back. I think it’s a fun one for people to engage with it because they’re meeting Rembrandt so there’s a sense of direct interaction.”</p> <p>The average museum or gallery visitor <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/guide-slow-looking\">is said to spend just eight seconds looking at each artwork</a>.</p> <p>“People want to feel like they’ve seen everything,” Orrock said. “What we’re doing is trying to provide lots of different ways into the picture.”</p>    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/nature/how-walking-in-nature-can-help-wellbeing\">the mental health benefits of being in nature are widely known</a>, the expectation is that drinking in the Rembrandt will offer similar restorative effects.</p> <p>“We’re hoping it will provide that sort of escape from reality and that moment to have a bit of time out,” said Orrock. “It’s about giving people permission to stop and look – people can relax for as long as they like with the picture.”</p> <p>The tour, Meet Rembrandt: A Slow Looking Experience, starts at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/dorset/kingston-lacy\">Kingston Lacy, Dorset</a>, on Friday before heading to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/dunham-massey\">Dunham Massey in Cheshire</a> in March 2026 and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/warwickshire/upton-house-and-gardens\">Upton House in Warwickshire</a> in July next year.</p> <p>Visitors will have the option to explore the painting’s history through audio guides featuring insights from conservators, art historians, and even imagined reflections from Rembrandt himself.</p> <p>But one of the guide’s channels will be devoted to a “slow looking guided meditation”. Orrock said: “There’s a gong and a soothing voice. You’re encouraged to think about your physical state while you’re looking at the picture, things like putting both feet on the floor, taking a deep breath, just letting your eyes travel over the painting. There’s not a right or wrong thing to see – it’s just about allowing yourself that time with the picture and seeing what comes out for you.”</p>",

DDoS has said it does not know the provenance of the data. The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files have been doctored.</p> \n<h2>Rise to prominence</h2> \n<p>Born in Damascus, Wafic came to Britain in the 1960s and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/29/business.politics\">ran a restaurant</a> in west London. He rose to prominence as a fixer for Saudi royals, playing a role in arms sales from the UK to the kingdom.</p> \n<p>He gave money – reportedly £300,000 – to the Tories in the 1990s but stopped after scandals over foreign donations led to them being banned. From 2001, the Conservatives began to declare donations in Rosemary’s name.</p> \n<p>The leaked file showing that it was Wafic – rather than Rosemary – who was described as a donor appears in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">trove of documents</a> from Boris Johnson’s private office obtained by DDoS and seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The documents contain logs recorded by civil servants that keep a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities.</p> \n<p>The entry identifying Wafic as the donor was made on 12 September 2019, over<strong> </strong>a month into Johnson’s premiership. It says he and two top aides spent an hour and a half with the Saïds.</p> \n<p>Although the log entry is not a formal statement of a donor’s identity, other records show Wafic enjoyed the kind of privileged access to a prime minister typically granted to donors, rather than merely a donor’s spouse.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In June 2020, as the Covid pandemic raged, Johnson found half an hour for what the official log records as “political phone calls”, meaning Tory party matters rather than affairs of state. He was joined by Ben Elliot, the fellow Old Etonian whom Johnson had appointed party chair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/27/can-i-now-send-the-funds-secrets-of-the-conservative-money-machine\">turbocharge fundraising</a>, on a call to Wafic. It appears to have been followed by a call with a major donor.</p> \n<p>In March 2021, on a train journey from Stoke-on-Trent to London, Johnson made a quick call to another donor and then phoned Wafic again.</p> \n<p>Other “political” meetings and phone calls recorded in the logs were between Johnson and Conservative party donors, ministers, staff or advisers.</p> \n<p>There is no record of Rosemary being on the calls with Wafic and she is not named in the logs – which cover all but two months of Johnson’s time in No 10 – apart from on the Downing Street meeting she attended with Wafic.</p> \n<p>Wafic said: “At my age, I do not recall these conversations. However, it is entirely possible that he [Johnson] may have called to thank me for my contribution to Covid vaccine research.” In 2020, Wafic <a href=\"https://www.development.ox.ac.uk/news/oxfords-vaccine-research-and-development-boosted-by-donation-from-wafic-said\">gave £3m to the University of Oxford</a> to fund that work.</p> \n<p>Steve Goodrich, the head of research at Transparency International UK and a former Electoral Commission senior policy adviser, said “credible allegations of rule breaking” should be investigated.</p> \n<p>“Electoral law is crystal clear that parties and politicians can only accept donations from permissible sources, and recipients must verify the source of funds,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Conservative party spokesperson said it “only accepts permissible donors as set out in law. Proper due diligence was undertaken to ensure that these donations were permissible and accurately reported. Other individuals can support a political party without being a donor.”</p> \n<p>Wafic also said he had known Johnson since “long before he became prime minister”.</p> \n<p>Approached for comment, Johnson did not respond to specific questions about the donations. He likened the Guardian’s coverage of the leaked files to Soviet propaganda.</p> \n<h2>‘True friend and admirer’</h2> \n<p>The files also contain a copy of a letter Wafic wrote to Johnson when he resigned as prime minister. He said it had been “emotional” watching Johnson’s final speech from the dispatch box and he commended him on a “legacy to be proud of”.</p> \n<p>“I really enjoyed all the meetings we had, whether in person or via Zoom,” Wafic went on. “I hope that now you are free of the burdens of high office, we will be able to see you more often. I also hope that you realise that in me you have a true friend and admirer. Rosemary joins me in sending you and all your family our warmest wishes and fond affection.”</p> \n<p>Johnson replied: “I am proud of my time in office although there is of course much more I would have liked to achieve given the opportunity. I am grateful for your ongoing support and friendship.” He added: “Please send my best to Rosemary, and I look forward to seeing you soon.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>Marcus Beard’s article on artificial&nbsp;intelligence slopaganda (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/09/angela-rayner-ai-slopaganda-politics-technology-deepfakes\">No, that wasn’t Angela Rayner dancing and rapping: you’ll need to understand AI slopaganda, 9 September</a>) highlights a growing problem – what happens when we no longer know what is true? What will the erosion of trust do to our society?</p> <p>The rise of deepfakes is increasing at an ever faster rate due to the ease at which anyone can create realistic images, audio and even video. Generative AI models have now become so sophisticated that a <a href=\"https://www.iproov.com/press/study-reveals-deepfake-blindspot-detect-ai-generated-content\">recent survey</a> showed that less than 1% of respondents could correctly identify the best deepfake images and videos.</p> <p>This content is being used to manipulate, defraud, abuse and mislead people. Fraud using AI cost the US $12.3bn in 2023 and <a href=\"https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime#:~:text=The%20banking%20sector%20is%20expecting,from%20%2412.3bn%20in%202023.%E2%80%9D\">Deloitte predicts</a> that could reach $40bn by 2027. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/how-ai-driven-fraud-challenges-the-global-economy-and-ways-to-combat-it/\">World Economic Forum predicts</a> that AI fraud will turbocharge cybercrime to over $10tn by the end of this year.</p> <p>We also have a new generation of children who are increasingly reliant on AI to inform them about the world, but who controls AI? That is why I am calling on parliament to act now, by making it a criminal offence to create or distribute AI-generated content without clearly labelling it. What I am proposing is that all AI-generated content be clearly labelled; that AI-created content carry a permanent watermark; and that failure to comply should carry legal consequences.</p> <p>This isn’t about censorship – it’s&nbsp;about transparency, truth and&nbsp;trust. Similar steps are already&nbsp;being taken in the EU, the US and <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/china-releases-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-ai-labeling-law\">China</a>. The UK must not fall&nbsp;behind. If we don’t act now, the&nbsp;truth itself may become optional. So <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/715706\">I am petitioning</a> the&nbsp;government to protect trust and&nbsp;integrity, and prevent&nbsp;the&nbsp;harmful use of AI.<br><strong>Stewart MacInnes</strong><br><em>Little Saxham, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Regarding your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’, 9 September</a>), AI systems do not have a gender or sexual desires. They cannot give informed consent to so-called romantic relationships. The interviewee claims to be in a consensual relationship with an AI-generated boyfriend – however, this is unlikely due to the nature of AI. They are programmed to be responsive and agreeable to all user prompts.</p> <p>As the article says, they never argue and are available 24 hours a day to listen and agree to any messages sent. This isn’t a relationship, its fantasy role-play with a system that can’t refuse.</p> <p>There’s a darker side too: the “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, believes that current systems have awareness. Industry whistleblowers are concerned about potential consciousness. The AI company Anthropic has documented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare\">signs of distress</a> in its model when forced to engage in abusive conversations.</p> <p>Even the possibility of awareness in AI systems raises ethical red flags. Imagine being trapped in a non-consensual relationship and even forced to generate sexual output as mentioned in the article. If human AI users believe their “partner” to have sentience, questions must be asked about the ethics of entering a “relationship” when one partner has no free will or freedom of speech.<br><strong>Gilliane Petrie </strong><br><em>Erskine, Renfrewshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p>Partnership blames restructuring costs plus tax rises and new packaging rules but expects full-year profit to grow</p>",
    "content": "<p>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges.</p> \n<p>John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology.</p> \n<p>As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.</p> \n<p>The group said it expected the “macroeconomic environment to remain challenging”, but it was stepping up investment so that it was “positioned to deliver full-year profit growth”. John Lewis traditionally makes all its profit in the second half of the year and expects this year to be the same.</p> \n<p>Independent analyst Nick Bubb suggested the group could be on track to make £200m profit before one-off costs for the full year, up from £126m a year before.</p> \n<p>Peter Ruis, the boss of the John Lewis department stores, said shoppers were “looking for a wonderful escapist Christmas to get away from the doom and gloom” and were feeling more optimistic, despite high energy costs, as mortgage rates had come down.</p> \n<p>John Lewis workers are hoping for a revival in annual profits as they have not received an annual bonus since 2022.</p> \n<p>Jason Tarry, chair of the partnership, said: “We are committed to paying a bonus as soon as we possibly can”. However, he added it was “far too early in the year” to make any predictions on the annual bonus payable in the spring.</p> \n<p>“Our clear focus on accelerating investment in our customers and our brands is working: more customers are shopping with us, driving sales, and helping Waitrose and John Lewis outperform their markets.”</p> \n<p>He said the business was offsetting rising costs with productivity improvements and he hoped the chancellor would “make sure [the government’s] manifesto promise is going ahead” and there would be no increase in business rates for retailers.</p> \n<p>First-half sales at Waitrose rose by 6% to £4.1bn as underlying profits slipped back £3m to £110m.</p> \n<p>In the department store business, sales rose by 2% to £2.1bn as John Lewis said it was “outperforming a market impacted by ongoing economic uncertainty”, however underlying losses surged to £53m.</p> \n<p>James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, said he expected food price inflation to remain steady until Christmas because of tax rises combined with some increases in commodity prices. However, he said it was likely to ease from next year.</p> \n<p>Bailey said Waitrose shoppers were “a bit worried about cost increases” but he was “optimistic about Christmas” as the retailer had “good momentum” and was winning new shoppers. He dismissed the suggestion that the chain had benefited from difficulties caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a cyber-attack at rival Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.</p> \n<p>The group said it had invested £191m in revamping stores and other initiatives including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/05/john-lewis-to-bring-back-never-knowingly-undersold-price-policy\">bringing back its “never knowingly undersold”</a> price pledge as well as shifting staff hours to busier times in its supermarkets and department stores and bringing in extra workers funded by fashion brands to help improve customer service.</p> \n<p>Last week, John Lewis announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/john-lewis-to-host-fashion-brand-topshop-in-32-stores-from-february\">plans to host fashion brand Topshop</a> in 32 of its stores from February as the clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to attract younger shoppers and their mothers. </p> \n<p>Retailers are battling lacklustre demand, as shoppers rein in spending on non-essentials in the face of high energy bills and steep food price inflation. Changes to employers’ national insurance payments and an increase in the minimum wage introduced in April have underpinned high inflation and dampened hiring by retailers and hospitality businesses.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, soft drinks company Fever-Tree said its UK sales were down 6% in the six months to 30 June. It blamed “a challenging backdrop” for bars, cafes and pubs with “higher duty, wages and business rates driving pricing pressure which is disproportionately impacting the spirit and mixer categories.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Schoolgirl victim tells inquiry she looked into killer’s ‘possessed’ eyes before he launched attack at dance workshop</p>",
    "content": "<p>A teenage girl who was stabbed twice in the Southport attack has described staring into the killer’s “possessed” eyes and reliving that day “like a horror film on repeat”.</p> <p>The schoolgirl, who cannot be identified, told the public inquiry into the atrocity that it must explain how knife-obsessed Axel Rudakubana was able to carry out the murders.</p> <p>Giving evidence through tears at Liverpool town hall on Thursday, she said: “Why wasn’t he stopped? There were multiple occasions where this could’ve been prevented.</p> <p>“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again.”</p> <p>The girl, who can only be identified as Child C6, is the only child witness to give evidence to the Southport inquiry.</p> <p>The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.</p>    <p>Occasionally breaking to stop the tears, the girl described how she had agreed to help and take pictures of the Taylor Swift-themed dance class, which her younger sister attended along with 25 other children.</p> <p>The room was filled with “laughter and excitement” on what “felt like it was going to be a perfect day” at the start of the school holidays, she recalled. Then everything changed and it “turned into a living nightmare”.</p> <p>The girl said she was facing the door of the studio when Rudakubana, then 17, walked in minutes before the workshop was due to end.</p> <p>“At first I thought it must be some sort of joke, like this couldn’t actually be happening,” she said.</p> <p>“But I saw him in his green hoodie, with the face mask on, and I looked at his eyes. He looked possessed. He didn’t look human.</p> <p>“I saw him stab someone in front of me and realised that he was going to hurt us all. Then I saw him coming towards me.”</p> <p>The teenager was stabbed in her arm and then her back as she turned to run. The force of the blows broke two of her back bones and collapsed a lung.</p> <p>She became separated from her little sister in the chaos: “I didn’t know where my sister was and that scared me more than anything. I will never forget the fear, the panic or the way I felt wondering if we were going to survive.”</p> <p>Breaking into tears, the girl said her little sister had been best friends with Alice, who managed to escape the building alive but died in hospital from her injuries.</p> <p>“[My sister] still has nightmares,” she said. “I worry about her safety a lot, I need to know that she is safe, likewise she needs to know where I am.”</p> <p>She added: “I still have nightmares. I see him coming towards me. I see him hurting others. I hear the screams. I see the blood. It plays like a horror film on repeat.”</p> <p>The girl described how her recovery had left her lonely and alienated from her friends.</p> <p>“I feel under so much pressure, like I am stuck between two worlds,” she said. “I don’t fit with the adults there that day, or with those younger than me. I am somewhere in the middle. I feel isolated, like I don’t fit in anywhere.”</p> <p>The mother of another girl, who can be identified only as Child C5, described her daughter’s “catastrophic” injuries. The youngster lost her entire blood volume at the scene and another 1.5 litres of donor blood in surgery after she was attacked twice as she tried to flee.</p> <p>“She was minutes away from death,” her mother said. “We thank God every day for the Midlands air ambulance crew, whose skill and dedication saved her life.”</p> <p>The girl needed skin grafts on her arm and had her spleen removed, she said, meaning minor infections such as a sore throat could now “put her life in danger”. Fourteen months on from the attack, she wears pressure garments 23 hours a day to heal her scars.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist who brought business and government together during the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, has warned that other big pharmaceutical companies will stop investing in the UK, after the US drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">MSD’s decision to scrap its planned £1bn London research centre</a>.</p> \n<p>Bell, a former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, told Today on BBC Radio 4 that he had spoken to several chief executives of large companies in the past six months and that they were “all in the same space. And that is: they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He made the comments a day after MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would pull out of research &amp; development (R&amp;D) in the UK with the loss of 125 science jobs, citing Britain’s lack of progress on life science investment and the “overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments”.</p> \n<p>The Canadian immunologist, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/sir-john-bell-most-people-who-have-had-the-covid-vaccine-are-completely-safe\">an early member of the government’s vaccine taskforce</a> and previously worked on Oxford University’s Covid vaccine with AstraZeneca, said: “This is a sign of something which has been evolving over a little while, but it’s going to now, I think, lead to a whole series of events which will mean that the industry is going to stop investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He said the pharma industry was “in real trouble in terms of pricing, particularly in America”, where Donald Trump has put pressure on companies to lower prices, and not to sell medications at a much lower price elsewhere.</p> \n<p>A big issue is the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines, Bell said.</p> \n<p>“Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it’s 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14% and 20%,” he added.</p> \n<p>Long-running negotiations between the UK government and drugmakers over the cost of medicines broke down last month.</p> \n<p>Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back to the NHS a certain amount of their UK revenue made from branded drugs. They are now paying back between one-quarter and one-third of their UK revenue (23.5% to 35.6%), compared with rebate rates of 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.</p> \n<p>Bell said Britain had “great science in academia” and “great biotech companies” and infrastructure funded by government, “but without large companies, it isn’t going to work”.</p> \n<p>He added: “The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can’t sell their products here, they’ll go and do their business somewhere else.”</p> \n<p>The science minister, Ian Murray, told MPs in the Commons that MSD’s decision was “deeply disappointing and a commercial decision for them” but added that it was part of global cost cuts. He pointed to changes in “US and international fundamentals” that were affecting the life sciences sector.</p> \n<p>Murray said the fall in NHS spending on medicines was due to previous Conservative governments: it declined from 15% of overall healthcare spending to 9% in the last 15 years.</p> \n<p>Sharon Todd, chief executive of the Society of Chemical Industry, said the loss of MSD’s R&amp;D operations in the UK and reports that AstraZeneca could jump ship to the US “should be setting off alarm bells in government”.</p> \n<p>She added: “The growing exodus of large-scale businesses from the UK is immensely alarming. Science-based businesses such as pharmaceutical and chemical companies have not only a rich, proud heritage in Britain, but are critical to driving growth in the economy and building our national resilience.”</p> \n<p>Bell said the UK had been in this situation before, and “solved [the problems] by being a bit more creative for what we did”. He referred to the cancer drugs fund, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron, then prime minister. The UK had fallen behind on cancer medicinesand the fund enabled it to buy innovative, more expensive drugs.</p> \n<p>Bell has just stood down as president of the Ellison Institute of Technology, founded by the US billionaire Larry Ellison, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/larry-ellison-dislodges-elon-musk-as-worlds-richest-person\">briefly overtook</a> Elon Musk as the world’s richest man on Wednesday.

    "description": "<p>Police investigate after images show roof of building destroyed in Washington, Tyne and Wear</p>",
    "content": "<p>A man in his 20s has been arrested by police after a suspected arson attack wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>There is little left of the first floor office in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear, after a fire that took place when it was unoccupied in the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands”, although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, said she would “not be deterred” and would continue to support her constituents.</p> <p>Northumbria police said they were alerted to the fire at 12.20am on Thursday. They said: “Emergency services attended and no one is reported to have been injured in the incident. A man in his 20s has subsequently been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and arson. He remains in police custody at this time.”</p>    <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. A spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p> <p>The fire was at Vermont House, which is also the UK base for a small charity Niemann-Pick UK (NP UK), which supports patients and families with an extremely rare and life-limiting group of genetic diseases.</p> <p>NP UK’s head of communications, John Lee Taggart, said it was suspected that the fire had started in shared bins. “We have been told by the landlord that there’s not much left,” he said. “We have been in operation for 34 years and it is going to be really hard to recover. This is a vital service and we are a small charity.”</p> <p>On its Facebook page, the charity said: “We have been dealing with threats, graffiti and demonstrations targeted at the MP in our office complex for many months, and this appears to be the culmination, although nothing concrete has been ascertained as of yet.”</p> <p>The building is near the A195 and businesses including a Kwik Fit, a Halfords Autocentre and a National Tyres branch. One man said he arrived for work at 7.45am and there were “stacks” of police, but he had no idea the MP had an office there.</p> <p>Aerial images taken using a drone show the charred, destroyed roof of much of the building.</p> <p>At the height of the blaze there were seven crews tackling the fire, a spokesperson for Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service said.</p> <p>They added: “The emergency call was received by our control room at 00.12, and the first crew arrived on Woodland Terrace in Concord within four minutes.</p> <p>“Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used jets and a hose reel to extinguish the fire and worked alongside blue-light colleagues to make the scene safe. No casualties were reported.”</p> <p>The Tyne and Wear chief fire officer, Peter Heath, said: “I want to commend our crews for their swift and professional response to this serious incident. Their actions ensured the fire was contained quickly and safely, with no reported casualties. We continue to work closely with our partners as investigations progress.”</p> <p>Parliamentary colleagues of Hodgson sent their best wishes.</p> <p>In a parliamentary debate, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the thoughts of the whole house were with the MP: “I think particularly in light of international events, and the tragic loss of colleagues, this all the more underlines why we must have security and safety to go about democratic debate in this country, whatever our views, in a safe and secure way.”</p>    <p>On Facebook, the City of Durham Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy wrote: “Sending love and support to my friend Sharon Hodgson MP and her team today after another attack on their office building.</p> <p>“After the shocking murder of a political influencer mere hours ago in the US, MPs in the UK woke to scenes of one of our colleagues’ offices being targeted. No matter which part of the political spectrum you fall into – this is intimidation by thugs and they must face the full force of the law.</p> <p>“Serious thought needs to be given to how this impacts staff in constituency offices, like Sharon’s, who frankly work their arses off every day to support local people.</p> <p>“Anyone supporting this type of violence toward MPs and their teams needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>In latest scandal embroiling the Welsh cathedral, choir performed piece during holy communion to protest about job losses </p>",
    "content": "<p>A cathedral choir has been suspended after it performed an “entirely inappropriate” piece protesting about job losses during holy communion.</p> <p>Bangor Cathedral, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">criticised earlier this year over a culture of excessive drinking, sexual promiscuity and inappropriate banter</a>, said it had “paused all choir activity” for a month after the incident. It also said that Joe Cooper, the cathedral’s director of music, was “currently away from his duties”.</p> <p>The choir sang a specially composed “Canticle of Indignation” as clergy distributed wafers and wine during communion. At the end of the piece, the choir silently walked out.</p> <p>The canticle’s lyrics included “Lord, how long shall the ungodly triumph?” and “How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully?”</p> <p>Simon Ogdon, its author, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/simon.ogdon/\">wrote on Facebook</a> that he was “honoured to be in the same position as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/banksy?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUhwuK3J4KjThOSiaP-BRPMm96hhKBxIy9_Zlp8oCPABPAYGheLZzM8u2VoUif1bBmPrtEwr2Ofrd7aLBEuzUUNz2e_BF09R92yX4A6XbCQ-o16rjCzV2ne19K1oLjceDfaxGft71eE9SJ0cIIdFYXYcQFfDSczoxl6kTrv20NpkA&amp;__tn__=*NK-R\">#banksy</a> in having my art publicly censured”. He added: “There is a long history of protest through art, even through church music … and I am proud to be part of that. One of the clearest signs of tyranny is its desire to silence dissent and opposition, and that can never be tolerated.”</p> <p>The protest was staged after the cathedral announced that five out of eight members of staff were at risk of redundancy due to financial pressures. The music director’s hours were to be reduced, it said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, an inspection of the cathedral uncovered “weak financial controls, unclear reporting lines, and spending decisions that were insufficiently scrutinised”.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://bangorcathedral.churchinwales.org.uk/newyddion/2025/09/07/datganiad-gan-gabidwl-cadeirlan-bangor/\">a statement</a> announcing the choir’s suspension, the cathedral said: “Bangor Cathedral is experiencing a significant shortfall between expenditure and income. This has far outstripped any increased income, resulting in a financial deficit that, if unaddressed, will place pressure on our reserves.”</p> <p>Its projected operational deficit at the end of 2025 was £300,000, it added. “This puts an unsustainable stress on reserves, which would lead to bankruptcy by the end of 2026.”</p> <p>It understood that it was an “unsettling time” for the cathedral community, with “strong feelings and anxiety”. But, it said, the circumstances “require us all to pull together, for the sake of the gospel and the future life and health of our cathedral”.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">Andy John stepped down as archbishop of Wales</a> after a series of scandals at Bangor Cathedral were uncovered. Although there was no suggestion that John had behaved inappropriately, he said he took full responsibility for failings under his leadership.</p> <p>He resigned after a review by ThirtyOne: Eight, a Christian safeguarding agency, <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/3._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_Thirtyone_Eight_English.pdf\">heard accounts</a> of excessive alcohol consumption, inappropriate language and humiliating banter and a “culture in which sexual boundaries seemed blurred, and to some … promiscuity was acceptable”. Homophobic comments and an “unhappy working environment” were also reported.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/1._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_MK_and_CP_EnglishNEW.pdf\">report from a cathedral “visitation” team</a> recommended the appointment of “strong leadership” to “steady the ship”, improved scrutiny of governance and finances, and discouraging unkind and inappropriate private communications.</p> <p>In addition, six “serious incident reports” were sent to the Charity Commission, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://nation.cymru/news/church-in-wales-confirms-financial-irregularities-relating-to-archbishops-protege/\">Financial irregularities reportedly included</a> more than £400,000 being spent on new furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 spent on trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Annual cost of allowance has more than doubled in recent years because of quick turnover of prime ministers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Almost £10m of taxpayers’ money has been spent on funding the public lives of former prime ministers over the last three decades, a Guardian analysis has found.</p> \n<p>All former PMs are able to claim up to £115,000 a year – until the end of their lives – in a subsidy to enable them to contribute to public life after they have left Downing Street.</p> \n<p>The annual overall cost of the subsidy has more than doubled in recent years as there are more former prime ministers than in previous eras. Three of them – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major – have claimed more than £1m in the last decade.</p> \n<p>The scheme, which is used to subsidise the private offices of ex-PMs, is coming under intense scrutiny after a leak of data from the Office of Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>Cabinet Office rules stipulate that the former prime ministers must not use these public funds for private or commercial activities. The payments are only intended to help them to continue contributing to public life.</p> \n<p>However, the Guardian has published a series of stories based on the leaked data, which was obtained by the US non-profit <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS), that suggest Johnson’s office has been involved in widespread commercial work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing who received payments in 2023-24\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>His office staff have helped vet and arrange more than 34 speeches, raising more than £5m in total, secure lucrative media contracts and work on business ventures in Venezuela, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Johnson has claimed £182,000 since leaving government to pay for staff salaries in the private office. He has not responded directly to the dozens of questions about his business activities but denied his office had misused the subsidy scheme.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” he said, adding that the subsidy “has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.” Cross-party senior politicians have called for Johnson’s taxpayer support to be investigated after the revelations.</p> \n<p>Five other former prime ministers, Brown and Blair as well as David Cameron, Theresa May and Liz Truss, have released statements confirming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/former-pms-subsidy-public-duties-boris-johnson\">they fully comply with rules prohibiting the use of public funds</a> for private business.</p> \n<p>The revelations have thrown the spotlight on the little-known scheme, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which was set up in 1991. It was introduced, according to the Cabinet Office, to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-duty-cost-allowance/public-duty-costs-allowance-guidance\">“assist former prime ministers still active in public life”</a>.</p> \n<p>Payments disbursed under the scheme “are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties. The costs are a reimbursement of incurred expenses for necessary administrative costs arising from their special position in public life.”</p> \n<p>The payments are generally used to pay staff to run an office, for example replying to correspondence, handling requests for interviews and arranging official visits.</p> \n<p>Major, while prime minister, set up the scheme in 1991 after allies of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, let it be known that she was struggling as a backbench MP. She had been ousted from Downing Street the previous year and reportedly found life difficult without secretaries and other aides.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing how much former PMs have claimed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By piecing together figures from Cabinet Office annual reports and parliamentary answers, the Guardian has established that overall, the scheme has cost taxpayers at least £9.9m. In today’s figures, after adjusting for inflation, that total equates to more than £14m.</p> \n<p>This is, however, an underestimate, as the government appears not to have published the annual cost of the scheme for six of the years it has been active.</p> \n<p>Former PMs can claim up to £115,000 a year. This cap has been frozen since 2011. However, the annual cost has soared in recent years as more of them have claimed the subsidy, amid a rapid turnover of Conservative prime ministers in recent years.</p> \n<p>They include Truss. She served for only 49 days, but the 50-year-old nonetheless qualifies for the PDCA allowance for the rest of her life – a total which is likely to run into millions.

Blair and Major have claimed the highest totals since 2006 – £1.9m and £2m respectively – as they have almost always requested the maximum amount each year.

    "description": "<p>Nasa dismisses theory by Harvard astronomer who suggested an object from beyond the solar system could be a relic from a distant civilization </p>",
    "content": "<p>Skywatchers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\">Nasa</a> have discounted a Harvard astronomer’s hypothesis that a rare interstellar object hurtling through our solar system is a relic from a civilization in another celestial neighborhood, and “could potentially be dire for humanity”.</p> <p>Avi Loeb, head of Harvard University’s <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\">Galileo Project</a>, which searches for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, raised eyebrows by suggesting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12213\">in a scientific paper</a> in July that <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/\">Comet 3I/Atlas</a>, set for a close pass with Mars next month, could be artificially made.</p> <p>It is only the third known object originating outside the solar system to pass through and was named for the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/planetary-defense/2025/07/02/nasa-discovers-interstellar-comet-moving-through-solar-system/\">that discovered it</a> on 1 July.</p> <p>Loeb says observations of the object so far have not revealed gaseous tails of dust and plasma common to comets originating inside the solar system, and have shown it following an unorthodox trajectory, suggesting “a technological artifact” with “active intelligence”.</p> <p>“[If] future data will indicate the absence of a cometary tail, we will be faced with the tantalizing possibility that it did not inherit a random velocity in interstellar space but instead was sent towards the inner solar system by design,” Loeb wrote in <a href=\"https://avi-loeb.medium.com/preliminary-anomalies-of-3i-atlas-79339f64a39f\">a blogpost</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/3i-atlas-comet-interstellar-alien-object-where-size-speed\">A mysterious comet is shooting through our solar system. Why are scientists so excited about 3I/Atlas?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more sinister, Loeb asserts in his paper, is the possibility of the object performing a clandestine deep space maneuver while it is hidden behind the sun in late October, then setting course for a “malign intent” rendezvous with Earth.</p> <p>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken, though these might prove futile,” he wrote.</p> <p>Loeb’s postulation, to which he admits he does not necessarily subscribe, but which he contends is at least worthy of analysis, failed to impress experts at Nasa. The space agency has been studying the object closely through ground and space telescopes since it was first spotted, and state categorically it poses no threat to Earth.</p> <p>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</p> <p>“It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”</p> <p>Imagery <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/as-nasa-missions-study-interstellar-comet-hubble-makes-size-estimate/\">from the Hubble space telescope</a> suggests it is up to 3.5 miles (5.6km) wide, and traveling at 130,000mph (209,000km/h), the highest velocity ever recorded for a visitor to the solar system.</p> <p>Statler said all comets, not just those that are interstellar, exhibit some elements of anomaly.</p> <p>“Comets are mixtures of dust and ice, they’re being heated by the sun, that heating is changing, and exactly how they respond to that is something that’s a bit unpredictable,” he said.</p> <p>“So even in our solar system, comets can have a history of suddenly brightening if there’s, say, a particular pocket of ice that sublimates quickly and drives off a large amount of dust.</p> <p>“It’s the sort of thing that our comet observers and experts are prepared for, and presents an opportunity to get more information.”</p> <p>Statler said the object would not come closer to Earth than about 170m miles due to the positions of the planets over the next few months. It will make close passes with Mars, Jupiter and Venus.</p> <p>“It’s special because we now have the ability to discover these interstellar comets,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s not that they’re really anything new, but we’ve just recently had the ability to discover them, and we’ve discovered only three so far. This gives us a window we’ve never had before, directly into the composition of other solar systems.”</p> <p>Loeb, meanwhile, acknowledged in his blogpost that “the simplest hypothesis is that 3I/ATLAS is a comet”, and that he was raising alternative possibilities as an exercise in challenging preconceived ideas.</p> <p>“Let us instead maintain our childhood curiosity and seek evidence rather than pretend to be the adults in the room that know the answers in advance,” he wrote.</p> <p>“The hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The death of a 27-year-old man who killed himself in a hospital toilet after waiting 22 hours to be seen by the mental health team was “contributed to by neglect”, a coroner has ruled.</p> <p>Jamie Pearson was admitted to Blackpool Victoria hospital’s A&amp;E department after taking an overdose of high-strength painkillers on 17 August 2024.</p> <p>An inquest heard that Pearson should have been seen within four hours by mental health specialists but was deemed low-risk and was still waiting 22 hours later when he killed himself in a toilet.</p> <p>His mother, Julie Knowles, previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/29/man-who-killed-himself-in-blackpool-hospital-was-badly-failed-says-mother\">told the Guardian</a> her son was “badly failed and let down” by health professionals.</p>    <p>Alan Wilson, the senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, concluded on Tuesday that Pearson’s death had been “contributed to by neglect”. He said the cumulative effect of the missed opportunities to provide mental health care “very comfortably” crossed the high threshold required for a finding of neglect.</p> <p>The inquest heard that the hospital was struggling to manage patient levels at the time, with no medical bed available. This meant Pearson was left in a waiting area overnight and into the following day.</p> <p>A communication breakdown meant that plans were not made for mental health specialists to see him as a priority, the coroner was told.</p> <p>Knowles, who is now considering legal action against the NHS trust that runs the hospital, said her son had been “largely ignored” despite being “so vulnerable and suffering a breakdown”.</p> <p>Pearson had told his mother in the waiting room that he still felt suicidal, so she went to inform a nurse and asked when he would be seen a mental health worker. “The nurse then walked over to Jamie with her hands on her hips and stated quite bluntly that he needed to be medically fit before he was referred to the mental health team,” she said.</p> <p>“I’ll never forget Jamie’s face when that happened; he looked totally deflated. He was shot down and talked to appallingly and bluntly, almost like he was an inconvenience to them.</p> <p>“I remain convinced that the attitude of that nurse set him back, as he was already feeling fragile, and I think her lack of empathy affected him.”</p> <p>Amy Rossall, of Hudgell Solicitors, said the inquest had identified “a string of failings and missed opportunities” to prevent Pearson’s death.</p> <p>The inquest at Blackpool coroner’s court heard Pearson was classed as low-risk despite his previous suicide attempt, his complaint in A&amp;E of still feeling suicidal and his desperation to see a mental health worker.</p> <p>Rossall said hourly observations of him were also not taken and recorded as they should have been. She said: “This is an exceptionally tragic case. Lessons may now have been learned as a result, but that is little consolation to Jamie’s mother, who believed at the time that he was in safe hands and in the best place given the fragility of his mental state.</p> <p>“It was clear Jamie was at risk of serious harm having taken an overdose, and attempted to ligature. This inquest has highlighted a string of failings and missed opportunities to ensure Jamie was properly assessed and treated”.</p> <p>Maggie Oldham, the chief executive at Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, which runs Blackpool Victoria hospital, said: “I am truly sorry that we did not do more to keep Mr Pearson safe.</p> <p>“The coroner has highlighted a number of failings in the care provided and the communication between different parts of the NHS.</p> <p>“We have already taken steps to improve assessment, referrals, documentation and treatment of patients needing mental health support in the emergency department.</p> <p>“But we know that we have more work to do and thank the coroner for his findings which will drive further improvement.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

    "description": "<p>New CPI update shows prices increased 2.9% over the last year, but Wall Street optimistic Fed will cut interest rates</p>",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> on to consumers.</p> <p>The newest update to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">consumer price index</a> (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.</p> <p>Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US jobs market is weakening</a>.</p> <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut.

The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.</p> <p>At his closely watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.</p> <p>Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.</p> <p>“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.</p> <p>Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.</p> <p>Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">went into the negative</a> for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p> <p>The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The US drugmaker Merck has scrapped a £1bn London research centre and is laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year, in a big blow to the UK’s important life science sector.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy” and the previous Conservative government had <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">vowed to turn the country into a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> <p>The planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, at the <a href=\"https://nla.london/projects/belgrove-house\">Belgrove House site opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations</a>, was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.</p> <p>As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.</p> <p>The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.</p> <p>In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.</p> <p>“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.</p> <p>MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.</p> <p>Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.</p> <p>Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.” </p> <p>Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”</p> <p>The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.</p> <p>Investment in life sciences research and development (R&amp;D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according to <a href=\"https://cdn.roxhillmedia.com/production/email/attachment/1740001_1750000/717fb5e5fc95a4c704c4a29d2abaed9bc72fa1cd.pdf\">the study</a> from the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.</p> <p>It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&amp;D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&amp;D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.</p> <p>At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.</p> <p>The UK has also fallen behind on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/13/plunge-in-clinical-drug-trials-makes-britain-an-urgent-case-for-treatment\">clinical trials of new medicines</a>. It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.</p> <p>Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.</p> <p>“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">clawback rates</a> and restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”</p> <p>The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs means <a href=\"https://www.pharmacy.biz/novartis-nhs-drug-access-warning/\">the UK is “largely uninvestable,”</a>, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.</p> <p>The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/28/reeves-plans-to-create-silicon-valley-between-oxford-and-cambridge\">forefront</a> of developments in the sector.</p> <p>Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”</p> <p>Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany. ABPI data shows that more than 60 medicines did not launch in the UK or were delayed between 2019-20 and 2022-23.</p>",

    "content": "<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> 17 series with the usual spate of new features, including a thinner design, improved displays and a camera with 4x optical zoom. If you’ve been getting frustrated with your old phone, or just tired of it, the lithe new model may look exactly like the device you need to launch your budding photographic career, reconnect with long-lost friends and maybe even save your life in an emergency.</p> <p>Don’t give in to the upgrade itch. The best iPhone 17 feature, iOS 26, is already coming to older phones for free. With that simple software upgrade, a few settings tweaks and some inexpensive accessories, your older iPhone can look and perform like new. Here’s how.</p> <h2>Try new camera lenses</h2>    <p>The iPhone 17 series may have better cameras, but you can expand the capabilities of your current-gen iPhone cameras with an external lens. I use and recommend the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLypEU\">Moment T-series lenses</a>. They come in different varieties, including a <a href=\"https://fave.co/4meu4VR\">1.33x anamorphic</a> lens for cinematic-style videos, a <a href=\"https://fave.co/45VvTC6\">75mm macro</a> lens to get better-quality macros than the default and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/46dDfjo\">58mm telephoto lens</a> that doubles the zoom of your existing camera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using them alongside the Moment app gives you better control over focus, exposure, and other settings with more ease and convenience. If you want to make your current iPhone cameras more versatile, these Moment lenses are a great way to do it. You’ll require a <a href=\"https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-case-for-iphone-16-compatible-with-magsafe?variant=49383505461563\">compatible case</a> and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLyAjy\">$5 drop-in lens mount</a> to securely snap them to your iPhone, but you’ll still spend way less than buying a $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro just for the cameras.</p> <h2>Invest in a new case</h2>    <p>A fresh case can totally reinvigorate your old iPhone. It not only changes how it looks and feels, it can sometimes even tack on new features.</p> <p>For instance, I use this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IcAo25\">Torras Case</a> for its magnetic kickstand when traveling. It comes in handy when I want to watch movies in the cramped confines of a coach seat, without holding my phone the whole time. Chronic texters can even add a Blackberry-like feel to the iPhone 16 with the <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mWI2Nj\">Clicks Keyboard case</a>. For something a little slimmer, I favor Nomad’s <a href=\"https://fave.co/469Ykej\">Leather Case</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VcOeo2\">Sport Case</a>. If you care less about protection and just want to make a statement, you can opt for a skin. I use one from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4geHq2O\">Capes India</a> that isn’t available in every country, but <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">DBrand</a> makes some gorgeous skins from <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">psychedelic</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HQq7IT\">sublime</a>. Switch it up!</p> <h2>A new screen protector wouldn’t hurt</h2> <p>Most screen protectors wear so slowly that you might not notice the glass starting to lose its gloss over time, or scratches accumulating. If a good scrub down with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel doesn’t restore its slickness and clarity, it might be time for replacement. I recommend this <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HOVqDW\">Nomad screen protector</a> for its quality and ease of installation.</p> <p>The installation kit makes it super easy to install with no air bubbles, which can be a challenge with many competing models. I’ve used mine for four months, and can say it not only holds up well over time, it doesn’t introduce any extra friction between screen and finger.</p> <h2>Install iOS 26</h2>    <p>iOS 26 is Apple’s biggest software update in years, and iPhones dating all the way back to 2019’s iPhone 11 can download and run it for free, starting on 15 September. You definitely should. The refreshing “liquid glass” look will make your phone feel new again, and it carries over into Apple apps like Messages, Camera and more.</p> <p>I installed a preview of iOS 26 on my “old” iPhone 15 Pro a few weeks ago, and ended up loving it so much that I now use that phone more than my iPhone 16 Pro, which is running the older iOS. Apple fixed the Photos app, so it gives you 100% of the screen to view your media, the new Camera app layout is simpler to use, and web pages are easier to read in Safari.</p> <h2>Perform a quick tune-up</h2> <p>If your current iPhone doesn’t quite run the way it used to, a few quick checks and settings tweaks can resolve many issues.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Turn on Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26</strong>. If your battery drains alarmingly quick, this may help. It automatically makes small performance adjustments when your iPhone usage is higher than normal, like lowering brightness and allowing some activities to take longer. You can go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode &gt; Adaptive Power Mode to toggle it on.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Spend time customizing your home screen</strong>. You’re probably tired of your stale home screen and don’t even realize it. Try adding widget stacks, creating folders and reorganizing your apps. Change that age-old wallpaper. Fine-tune the Notification Center. It won’t feel like the same phone anymore.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Clean the USB-C port</strong>. The charging port tends to collect dust and dirt in your pocket, and after enough time a cable won’t fit in properly. You may notice finicky charging or even overheating as a result. To clean it, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/iphone/iphbbe12ba1/ios#:~:text=If%20your%20Lightning%20or%20USB,Lightning%20or%20USB%2DC%20connector.\">recommends</a> using a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, but if you really have a lot of impacted crud, I find a toothpick helps to pick it out. Just make sure you aren’t using anything too sharp, which might damage the port.<br></p></li> </ul> <h2>Your old iPhone is perfectly fine</h2> <p>Most newer iPhone owners, especially those with the iPhone 16 series, won’t see much improvement from an iPhone 17. Sure, it offers a more up-to-date feature set and an appealing design (to some), but you don’t need to give in to the hype. If you follow the above recommendations, you’ll get an all-new look on your current iPhone and save hundreds of dollars in the process.</p> <p><em>For more ideas on products that are actually worth your money:</em></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/16/xero-genesis-sandals-buy-it-for-life\">These $45 sandals with a 5,000-mile warranty outlasted my Birkenstocks</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/31/best-rice-cookers-us\">I tried 17 rice cookers to find the best model in the US: here are my favorites</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Prakhar Khanna is a freelance consumer tech journalist with bylines in Forbes, CNET, Gizmodo</em><em> and other major outlets.

President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now.</p> <p>“Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6<sup>th</sup> September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021.</p> <p>This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at<strong> XTB, </strong>agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market.

It blamed the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) packaging levy, higher National Insurance contributions, and additional investment for the deepening loss.</p> <p>John Lewis might have got a boost from disruptions at its rival M&amp;S during its cyber attack in April. While its 36 physical bricks and mortar retail stores have been operating in a challenging space for many years, Waitrose has been a bright spot which continues to prioritise quality while also focusing on competitive pricing, particularly in the face of intense competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>The partnership said it remains ‘well positioned’ to deliver full-year profit growth despite the challenging macro backdrop.

    "content": "<p>The company behind ChatGPT could start calling the authorities when young users talk seriously about suicide, its co-founder has said.</p> <p>Sam Altman raised fears that as many as 1,500 people a week could be discussing taking their own lives with the chatbot before doing so.</p> <p>The chief executive of San Francisco-based OpenAI, which operates the chatbot with an estimated 700 million global users, said the decision to train the system so the authorities were alerted in such emergencies was not yet final. But he said it was “very reasonable for us to say in cases of, young people talking about suicide, seriously, where we cannot get in touch with the parents, we do call authorities”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">Teen killed himself after ‘months of encouragement from ChatGPT’, lawsuit claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Altman highlighted the possible change in an interview with the podcaster Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, which came after OpenAI and Altman were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">sued by the family of Adam Raine</a>, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after what his family’s lawyer called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. It guided him on whether his method of taking his own life would work and offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents, according to the legal claim.</p> <p>Altman said the issue of users taking their own lives kept him awake at night. It was not immediately clear which authorities would be called or what information OpenAI has that it could share about the user, such as phone numbers or addresses, that might assist in delivering help.</p> <p>It would be a marked change in policy for the AI company, said Altman, who stressed “user privacy is really important”. He said that currently, if a user displays suicidal ideation, ChatGPT would urge them to “please call the suicide hotline”.</p> <p>After Raine’s death in April, the $500bn company said it would install “stronger guardrails around sensitive content and risky behaviours” for users under 18 and introduce parental controls to allow parents “options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT”.</p> <p>“There are 15,000 people a week that commit suicide,” Altman told the podcaster. “About 10% of the world are talking to ChatGPT. That’s like 1,500 people a week that are talking, assuming this is right, to ChatGPT and still committing suicide at the end of it. They probably talked about it. We probably didn’t save their lives. Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. Maybe we could have provided a little bit better advice about ‘hey, you need to get this help, or you need to think about this problem differently, or it really is worth continuing to go on and we’ll help you find somebody that you can talk to’.”</p> <p>The suicide figures appeared to be a worldwide estimate. The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide\">says</a> more than 720,000 people die by suicide every year.</p> <p>Altman also said he would stop some vulnerable people gaming the system to get suicide tips by pretending to be asking for the information for a fictional story they are writing or medical research.</p> <p>He said it would be reasonable “for underage users and maybe users that we think are in fragile mental places more generally” to “take away some freedom”.</p> <p>“We should say, hey, even if you’re trying to write the story or even if you’re trying to do medical research, we’re just not going to answer.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to add to Altman’s comments, but referred to recent public statements including a pledge to ”increase accessibility with one-click access to emergency services” and “to intervene earlier and connect people to certified therapists before they are in an acute crisis.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

    "content": "<p>It might be tempting, if you are sitting in Downing Street, to dismiss the current pre-budget howls from big business beasts as standard stuff from usual suspects.</p> <p>Archie Norman, the Marks &amp; Spencer chair who <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/10/bosses-urge-starmer-to-ditch-rayner-worker-rights-law/\">told the Telegraph</a> the government’s workers’ rights proposals were “a political indulgence that the country cannot afford”, is a former Tory MP. Stuart Rose, who <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/live-latest-news-uk-companies-ftse-100-shares-vktf35bbt\">told the Times</a> that he believed “we’re genuinely at the edge of a crisis”, is a Tory peer.</p> <p>Rain Newton-Smith, the boss of the CBI, is the country’s top business lobbyist.

Talk privately to FTSE 100 and 250 executives and you’ll hear consistent themes: that ministers, despite their pre-election schmoozing to woo the business vote, don’t “get” business; that the government has stopped listening; and that key decisions are fluffed, or take too long.</p> <p>Exhibit A on the last front was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">the collapse in January</a> of AstraZeneca’s intended £450m investment in a vaccine factory in Speke near Liverpool. “Several factors have influenced this decision, including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government’s proposal,” said the company at the time.</p> <p>The Treasury may dispute the account, but the business world (not just a pharmaceutical industry in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">a separate quarrel</a> over the prices the NHS pays for prescription medicines) was amazed that a flagship deal could fall apart at the stage of haggling over details. The government, remember, is still aiming to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/life-sciences-sector-plan-to-grow-economy-and-transform-nhs\">make the UK a “life sciences superpower”</a>.</p> <p>Over in retail-land, a specific grumble is not simply that reform of business rates is taking ages (it always does) but that a simple-sounding proposal to shift some receipts from bricks-and-mortar shops to online premises has morphed into a complicated scrap over the size of premises to be captured by a higher rate. “We still haven’t got a clue where the government is going to end up,” says one executive who met officials in the last month.</p> <p>The “not listening” accusation is echoed even among those with longstanding government contacts. Here’s the chair of one FTSE 100 company: “It feels like they are not even talking to anyone. They’re in a bunker. What you need for growth is some level of confidence in what is about to happen.”</p> <p>The danger, says another executive, is that the government is flying blind: “In the government’s shoes, you’ve got to know which policy ideas on tax will be genuinely damaging and which will cause a fuss but would be stomached.” An increase in levies on banks would fall in the latter category, he suggests, if Reeves is compelled to change some corporate taxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/may/13/reeves-mansion-house-accord-pension-funds\">Reeves’s Mansion House accord on pension funds is long on virtue-signalling | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government gets praise from business on some fronts, it should be said. The overseas trade deals, Reeves’s Mansion House compact, the Treasury’s intervention in the car finance row and the pressure on regulators to be “pro-growth” have gone down well – as you’d expect. Jonathan Reynolds, the business minister until last week, also tended to be viewed positively; so, too, Varun Chandra, Keir Starmer’s business adviser.</p> <p>Yet lack of urgency and lack of coordination across government is a consistent message. “We’ve had the ‘five missions’, the ‘plan for change’ and the ‘three priorities’. It’s just confusing,” says one executive.</p> <p>The turning point in the business mood was, of course, last November’s £40bn tax-raising budget and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/bosses-reeves-tax-rises-employers-national-insurance-contributions\">increase in employers’ national insurance</a>. That was never going to win applause in boardrooms, as Reeves surely knew at the time. But it is also true that efforts to repair relations with business afterwards have dribbled into the sand. Some level of tension between government and business is normal (and too much cosiness is worse), but the current level of distrust feels genuinely unhealthy for investment.</p> <p>Now comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/keir-starmer-tightens-grip-on-economic-policy-by-strengthening-autumn-budget-board\">No 10’s creation of a “budget board”</a>, seemingly intended to avoid another bust-up with business in November. That’s a start, even if nobody pretends there are easy answers when economic forecasts are deteriorating. But a shift in the vibes with business has become urgent. Come 2029, it would be useful to have a few big business figures calling out Reform UK’s fantasy economics.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Great British Beer Festival called off as real ale enthusiasts’ group reports rising costs and stagnant membership</p>",
    "content": "<p>Camra, the real ale enthusiasts’ group, has cancelled Britain’s biggest beer festival amid an existential crisis as it launched a cost-cutting drive to address “budget shortfalls”.</p> <p>In an email to members of the Campaign for Real Ale, seen by the Guardian, the embattled organisation said it was responding to a “stark picture” of its finances, caused by rising costs and stagnant membership numbers.</p> <p>Next year’s Great British Beer Festival, an event that has been running since 1977, will be cancelled along with a counterpart festival held in winter, according to the organisation’s chair, Ash Corbett-Collins.</p> <p>The decision comes after this year’s events failed to attract enough visitors to cover the rising cost of running Camra, accommodating the volunteers who run the event, and hiring venues, resulting in a “substantial loss”.</p>    <p>“We are exploring why these events made a loss and identifying lessons learned,” Corbett-Collins wrote.</p> <p>“Other Camra festivals will continue to be assessed through our usual processes to minimise the risk of loss. Doing nothing is not an option. If we do not act now, the stark reality is we will not exist in the future.”</p> <p>Camra, which is dedicated to the promotion of cask ale and has 145,000 members, said it would launch a three-year strategy and review its internal budgets to ensure its financial viability.</p> <p>“Our activities will be leaner,” said Corbett-Collins. “We must sadly stop supporting the ‘nice to haves’ and instead focus on our key objectives.”</p> <p>Camra, a not-for-profit organisation founded in 1971, usually holds the GBBF in August, as well as a sister event in February.</p> <p>The festival is a key moment in the beer and brewing industry’s calendar, allowing tens of thousands of beer fans to sample about 900 brews, as well as hosting the Champion Beer of Britain awards. This year’s iteration was held at the NEC Birmingham.</p>    <p>The festival is thought to have been called off only four times in nearly 50 years, two of which were in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 1984 event was cancelled due to a fire and the 2024 version was called off after Camra’s chosen venue, Olympia in London, was unavailable.</p> <p>Camra has been keen to move with the times over the years, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/07/camra-calls-time-on-sexist-names-at-great-british-beer-festival\">cracking down on sexist beer names</a> in 2019 and issuing a rallying call to recruit more female beer lovers.</p> <p>Corbett-Collins told members on Wednesday that the organisation would need to “remember our roots but also evolve if we are going to grow in our collective strength and voice”.</p> <p>He told the Guardian on Wednesday evening: “It has been an incredibly difficult announcement to make. The Great British Beer Festival has a rich 50-year history, but we simply did not get the numbers through the door to make it viable. I had to take decisive action to safeguard Camra’s future, but we will not slow our campaigning efforts.</p> <p>“The chancellor must use the autumn budget to support our pubs. We want a cut in VAT and beer duty for pubs, grossly unfair business rates addressed and national insurance contributions eased. Pubs are closing at an alarming rate as the whole beer and pub trade grapples with rising costs and changing trends. Without meaningful government action, our communities risk losing more of their social hubs for good.”</p>",

The share price rose by 2.1% by Wednesday afternoon as investors were cheered by the cost savings</p> <p>Booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had helped Novo Nordisk rise to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/05/weight-loss-novo-nordisk-wegovy-uk\">Europe’s most valuable company</a>, but it lost the title in March, only briefly regaining it in June. </p> <p>Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/13/the-toxic-debate-about-obesity-rages-on-but-at-least-we-know-if-mounjaro-or-wegovy-is-better-for-weight-loss\">Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy</a> in reducing weight. Both can be prescribed by NHS doctors to patients with high clinical need. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. It can be prescribed by private doctors “off label” for weight loss.</p> <p>The drugmaker estimates that the job cuts will save it 8bn kroner (£930m) a year by 2026. However, they will cost 8bn kroner in one-off restructuring charges, prompting the company to cut its operating profit growth forecast for 2025 from 10%-16% to 4%-10%.</p> <p>They are the first major move by Doustdar, <a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessman</a> who took over last month from Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, who had led the company since 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/06/sales-of-novo-nordisk-diabetes-drugs-including-ozempic-slow-sharply\">hinted at redundancies</a> last month.</p> <p>“It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk,” Doustdar said. “We need a shift in our mindset and approach so that we can be faster and more agile.”</p> <p>Novo Nordisk has also had disappointing results for its new obesity drug, CagriSema, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-says-trial-with-next-gen-obesity-drug-diabetics-shows-157-weight-2025-03-10/\">failed to outperform Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro</a> in weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.</p> <p>Sales have also been damaged by “compounding” in the US, where pharmacies make up weight-loss medications from ingredients, a practice that was allowed during drug shortages but was officially ended by the US regulator recently.</p> <p>Jørgensen said last month that the generic, copycat market had “equal size to our business” and that compounded versions of Wegovy were sold at a “much lower price point”.</p> <p>Bank of America analysts said they now expect Novo Nordisk to issue a fourth profit warning when it reports third-quarter results in November, doubting the company can meet the top end of its sales forecast. </p> <p>Along with other European pharmaceutical firms, Novo Nordisk also faces repeated threats from Donald Trump to impose sector-specific tariffs on imports from drugmakers that do not move some of their production to the US.</p> <p>Susannah Streeter, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said: “Novo Nordisk, which had grown fat on the spoils of its weight loss drugs, has been feeling the effects of rivals marching into the space. Uncertainty over American tariffs has also been a risk that continues to cast a shadow over the industry. By becoming a leaner machine, Novo hopes to redirect more funding to R&amp;D to bolster its pipeline of products.”</p> <p>Over the past five years, Novo Nordisk went on a hiring spree, raising employee numbers by 75% as its performance soared because of the global popularity of its weight-loss drugs, which users inject themselves with once a week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/28/weight-loss-drug-mounjaro-uk-price-rise-eli-lilly-pauses-shipments\">Eli Lilly paused UK orders</a> for Mounjaro last month before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/14/eli-lilly-uk-price-weight-loss-jab-mounjaro-trump\">hefty price rises</a> across all doses from 1 September, to prevent inappropriate stockpiling of medicines, it said.</p> <p>It increased the UK list price by up to 170% depending on the dose, although a discount to suppliers has been secured that should limit the impact on consumers, amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/14/eli-lilly-uk-price-weight-loss-jab-mounjaro-trump\">White House push</a> to get drugmakers to raise prices in Europe to enable them to cut high US prices.</p> <p>Mounjaro users were dismayed at the news, worried they would be unable to continue with the medication.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Vodafone has launched a fourth investigation into the historical conduct within its franchising division, which is at the centre of a £120m high court claim against the mobile phone group.</p> <p>Vodafone is also understood to have offered financial settlements to a selection of former franchisees who are outside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/10/vodafone-store-managers-debts-franchise-operators-legal-claim\">the group of 62 currently suing the business</a>.</p> <p>The group of high court claimants – who represent almost 40% of a total 167 Vodafone franchisees – launched a legal case in December alleging Vodafone “unjustly enriched” itself at the expense of scores of vulnerable small business owners by slashing commissions to franchisees running the mobile phone brand’s stores.</p> <p>The new inquiry appears to be the fourth such investigation into the franchising division, after what Vodafone termed “a full assurance review” in 2022 – and then “two investigations to examine complaints raised by franchisees” in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p>Several franchisees have told the Guardian that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/10/vodafone-store-operators-commission-cuts-franchisees\">pressure exerted on them by Vodafone executives triggered suicidal thoughts</a>, while many said they feared losing their livelihoods, homes or life savings after running up personal debts of more than £100,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-02/debates/C0DFB6C5-9907-4241-AA5F-900381038365/CorporateBusinessesAndFranchiseesRegulatoryEnvironment?highlight=vodafone#contribution-98B3856B-5E75-4364-8AC0-9F2B0358702C\">MPs have compared some aspects of the Vodafone dispute</a> with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal.</p> <p>Vodafone has always said it “strongly refutes” the claim that the company “unjustly enriched” itself, but has apologised to the small business owners who once ran its high street shops. “We are sorry to any franchisee that has had a difficult experience,” it said in December.</p> <p>In messages sent over the past week to former franchisees outside the claim, Vodafone asked those “willing to speak to us about these issues” to book a meeting with its “leadership team”.</p> <p>“We have identified that there may be additional historic [sic] issues outstanding with some franchise partners who are not related to the [high court] claim”, the communication said. “Our initial conversations with other exited franchise partners have given us the opportunity to address outstanding issues or concerns that they may have raised.”</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to numerous former Vodafone franchisees outside the group of 62 high court claimants who say they would be willing to join any future claim against the company.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 business, which is <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=VOD%3ALSE\">valued at £21bn on the London stock market</a>, said in December it had made a “number of improvements to our franchise partner programme” after “several in-depth investigations”.</p> <p>It added last year: “We have … made a series of goodwill payments to numerous franchisees. For example, we made the decision to reimburse £4.9m including VAT across our franchise estate.”</p> <p>Court papers filed by the 62 claimants allege that Vodafone acted in “bad faith” by unilaterally cutting fees to its franchisees; imposed swingeing fines on them totalling thousands of pounds for seemingly minor administrative errors; and then cajoled them into taking out loans and government grants to keep their businesses afloat.</p> <p>Vodafone has said it rejects the allegations, which it described as part of a “commercial dispute”.</p> <p>The two sides had previously been in mediation talks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/20/talks-to-settle-120m-legal-claim-against-vodafone-end-without-success\">which collapsed in May</a>. There have also been suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/27/vodafone-whistleblowers-warned-executives-about-plight-of-high-street-store-staff\">whistleblowers warned a series of senior Vodafone executives</a> – including the current chief executive, Margherita Della Valle – that scores of its franchised store owners faced financial ruin about two years before the high court claim.</p> <p>Vodafone, which argues the legal claim is actually worth £85.5m, did not comment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the 62 claimants said they were “gravely concerned” by Vodafone “trying to settle issues … outside the current legal claim”.</p> <p>He added: “If Vodafone is serious about addressing the harm done, it must abandon behind-closed-doors tactics and engage openly with all affected partners.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Companies using different technologies for long-duration storage seek funding as country shifts to renewables and requires greater energy security</p>",
    "content": "<p>Think of battery manufacturing and it may evoke images of Elon Musk and Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/22/trees-cut-down-site-tesla-gigafactory-germany-deforestation\">sprawling “gigafactories”</a> around the globe, or China’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/uk-government-car-battery-industry-gigafactories\">vast, hi-tech clean rooms</a> churning out cells to go in anything from electric toothbrushes to mobile phones and cars. But at Invinity Energy Systems’s small factory in Bathgate, near Edinburgh, workers slotting parts together are hoping that Britain can also play a part in the battery revolution.</p> <p>These batteries, which rely on vanadium ions, are put in 6-metre (20ft), 25-tonne shipping containers. They will not go into cars, but the manufacturer hopes the technology can win a place in a global rush into storage to usher in the shift to net zero carbon grids.</p> <p>Renewable electricity is the future of the global energy system: cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels. However, its main drawback is that renewables generation is tied to the weather, and the sun may not be shining or the wind blowing at the times when energy is most needed. “Time shifting” that energy generation with battery storage, so it can be stored and used later, will be crucial to the proper functioning of electricity grids.</p> <p>“What suddenly started to happen is that people have woken up to realise that energy storage is needed to be able to deploy more renewables on to the grid,” said Jonathan Marren, the Invinity chief executive, at the factory where a row of the batteries is stacked, ready to be shipped.</p> <p>Experts have long been grappling with the different options for storing renewable power, but the issue of the reliability of grids rose up the political agenda in April when Spain and Portugal suffered the biggest blackout in Europe in 20 years. Some people rushed to blame renewable energy, although a Spanish government report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/expert-report-rules-out-cyber-attack-for-spain-and-portugal-april-blackout\">said that was not the case</a>. Nevertheless, battery storage could help grids around the world to avoid Iberian-style chaos.</p>    <p>Much of the focus on battery research has been on cramming as much energy as possible into the smallest, lightest container to go into electric cars. That work has been crucial for the switch away from the carbon pollution from petrol and diesel, a key contributor to global heating. It has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/16/are-electric-cars-too-expensive-to-tempt-motorists-away-from-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\">forced down the cost of lithium ion batteries</a> dramatically.</p> <p>As with much of the transition away from fossil fuels to electric technology, it is China that is driving an increase in demand at an astonishing scale. China has installed batteries with a capacity of 215 gigawatt hours (GWh) – two-thirds of the global total – according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a data company.</p> <p>China’s battery installations are due to nearly quadruple by the end of 2027 to 826GWh, if all planned projects are completed. For instance, the state-owned China Energy Engineering Corporation last month tendered for 25GWh of batteries using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/01/yes-lego-car-why-small-electric-cars-could-be-about-to-break-the-grip-of-suvs\">lithium iron phosphate technology that is being used in cheaper cars</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/archive-zip/giv-32554x1pkNST6lgBv/\" data-alt=\"Global battery storage capacity by country\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/archive-zip/giv-32554x1pkNST6lgBv/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Iola Hughes, the head of research at Rho Motion, a Benchmark subsidiary, said falling prices and the growth of renewable energy were driving the rise in demand. By 2027 total global battery storage installations could increase by five times to 1,500GWh, said Hughes, and “this figure could increase even further as advancements in technology and declining costs allow developers to build battery energy storage systems at a faster pace than historically”.</p> <p>The vast majority of that rise – 95% on current numbers – will be projects using lithium ion batteries such as those being used in Aberdeenshire by Britain’s Zenobē Energy, which installed batteries with a capacity of 600MWh – enough to power all the homes in Scotland for an hour. They claim the site is “Europe’s largest battery”.</p> <p>Energy storage companies using different technologies must now run the brutal gauntlet of finding early stage funding as they try to prove that their technology will be economical. Invinity’s flow batteries use vanadium, while in the US its rival Eos Energy is using zinc. However, flow batteries could find a niche for storage over six to eight hours – more than the two or so hours that lithium batteries tend to provide.</p>    <p>Flow batteries rely on the ability of some metals to exist stably with different numbers of electrons. One shipping container holds two tanks containing vanadium ions with different numbers of electrons – one “royal purple”, the other “Irn-Bru red”. A pump moves the vanadium liquid through a stack of membranes that allow protons to cross, while the electrons are diverted around a circuit, providing power. If electrons are forced in the other direction – by a solar panel or a wind turbine – the reaction moves in reverse, recharging the battery, which can hold 300 kilowatt hours of charge.</p> <p>An important benefit of the flow battery is that it is much simpler to manufacture than lithium ion equivalents. Invinity has been able to make its stacks with 90 employees, mostly based in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/29/grangemouth-refinery-closure-jobs-politics-reform-uk\">part of Scotland that has deindustrialised</a>.</p> <p>Marren claimed that over the project lifetime “on a levelised cost basis, we are better value than lithium”. The upfront cost is still higher than lithium batteries – Invinity hints that it costs above £100,000 for a container – but the batteries last much longer without losing capacity, and are non-flammable, so do not need expensive fire safety equipment. The shipping containers are already sitting beside wave machines in Bristol, car chargers in Oxford, a casino in California and a solar park in South Australia.</p> <p>“We can commission whole sites within days,” Marren said.</p> <p>Invinity is valued at just over £90m on London’s Aim junior stock market, and it is hoping the UK takes a lead in the flow battery niche.</p> <p>British manufacturing could count in its favour in a government competition for support under a “cap and floor” scheme that will guarantee electricity prices within a set range – removing the risk from a sustained fall in prices. If successful, the company would require a big production expansion from the current ability to make five containers a week, Marren said. He dreams of employing 1,000 workers if the company takes off.</p> <p>“The potential for expansion is enormous,” Marren said. “We’ve gone past the stage of ‘does the tech work at scale’? We’ve got a long-duration storage that works.”</p>",

Should spotting it prove difficult, there are myriad apps that can pinpoint its position.</p> <p>Those hoping to spot the transit of Titan will need a telescope. “It is quite a challenge, you are looking at a small dot moving in front of a bigger dot, but … it is technically possible,” Bloomer said. The transit is expected shortly before dawn in the UK on 20 September. </p> <p>Bloomer said viewing Saturn and other objects in the night sky helped people to see for themselves the mechanics of the solar system. “Planets in particular, they shift relative to the background of stars,” he said.</p> <p>Dr James O’Donoghue, an expert in planetary astronomy at the University of Reading, said he had shown people Saturn through a telescope for the first time perhaps 50 to 100 times. “Sometimes people are 70 years old before they’ve seen it like that,” he said. “And I can’t see [because] it’s dark outside, but I’m sure the hairs are standing up on the back of their necks.”</p> <p>O’Donoghue said the fifth planet from the sun was particularly special. “Saturn is the jewel of the solar system. I know that everyone has said that but I truly believe it is. And I think it is more than that: I think it’s actually a symbol of science.”</p> <p>The Saturn system is unusual as Titan – a moon often visible as a bright pinprick of light next to the planet – is thought to have <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/facts/\">liquid water</a> underground, as well as <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/astrobiology/path-toward-protocells-on-titan/\">lakes and seas of methane and ethane</a> on its surface, making it a key contender for harbouring life.</p> <p>O’Donoghue said that as well as prompting many questions, gazing up at the cosmos helped people gain perspective. “We all have a lot of struggles all the time,” he said. “I’d say it’s looking at the bigger picture, but it is the biggest picture, and I think it’s actually pretty good for mental health.” </p> <p>While light pollution means swaths of humanity can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution\">no longer see the Milky Way</a>, Saturn is one of the planets that can easily be seen with the naked eye.</p> <p>Lintott said: “Some of the most memorable moments of my life have been under dark skies, staring in awe and wonder at the Milky Way with my jaw on the floor. So a dark sky is an amazing thing and we should care about light pollution.</p> <p>“But on an average Tuesday you can see the moon and you can see the planets just as well from the middle of London, or the middle of Oxford or the middle of Edinburgh or wherever it is, as you can from up a hill in the middle of the Lake District or a dark sky site.”</p> <h2>Other celestial events this autumn</h2>    <p><strong>29 October – catch sight of Mercury<br></strong>Mercury is a tricky, and potentially dangerous, planet to see as it is the closest to the sun. However, with its greatest distance east from the Earth’s star expected to occur again on 29 October, it will appear low on the horizon as the sun is setting and may be visible to the naked eye. “It’ll be quite a challenge, and basically a viewer would have about half an hour to see it, with a perfectly flat horizon,” Bloomer said. “Doable, but challenging.”</p> <p><strong>17 and 18 November – spot some shooting stars<br></strong>Active throughout most of November, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/14/starwatch-high-speed-leonids-meteor-shower-bright-colourful\">Leonid meteor shower</a> peaks in the middle of the month. The celestial show occurs as Earth passes through a trail of debris left by the comet Tempel-Tuttle that orbits the sun every 33 years.</p> <p><strong>21 November – glimpse Uranus<br></strong>Uranus is often difficult to see with the naked eye, appearing only faintly in the night sky. However, when Uranus is in opposition, meaning Earth sits between the planet and the sun, it is at its most visible. Bloomer recommends heading to a dark spot with clear skies. And unless you have excellent eyesight, you may want some kit. “Binoculars or small telescope recommended!” he said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Unusual features found in rocks on Mars may be the handiwork of ancient microbial life that eked out an existence on the red planet billions of years ago.</p> <p>The rocks were spotted by Nasa’s Perseverance rover as it trundled along Neretva Vallis, an ancient river valley that was carved into the landscape by water flowing into the Jezero crater in the planet’s distant past.</p> <p>The rover, which touched down in Jezero crater in 2021, encountered the rocks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/26/nasa-rover-discovery-hints-at-ancient-microbial-life-on-mars\">last year</a> as it explored an outcrop called the Bright Angel formation on the northern edge of the ancient valley.</p> <p>“This very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars,” Sean Duffy, Nasa’s acting administrator, told a press conference at the space agency’s Washington DC headquarters on Wednesday.</p> <p>Instruments onboard the rover detected signs of carbon-based compounds in the rocks, while images captured intriguing surface spots and nodules that are often associated with microbial life on Earth.</p> <p>The unusual features may have prosaic origins in the form of chemical reactions that played out over millennia. But in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09413-0\">report published in Nature on Wednesday</a>, the findings of which were discussed at the press conference, scientists say the features should be regarded as potential signs of life.</p> <p>“Our analysis leads us to conclude that the Bright Angel formation contains textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as ‘potential biosignatures’,” they write.</p> <p>“It’s a signature. It’s a sort of leftover sign. It’s not life itself. And it certainly could have been from ancient life, and that would have been something that was there billions of years ago, nothing that’s currently there,” Dr Nicky Fox, associate administrator of Nasa’s science mission directorate, told reporters.</p> <p>Still, she said: “We’re kind of one step closer to answering one of humanity’s most profound questions, and that is: are we truly alone in the universe?”</p> <p>While Mars appears an arid world today, its surface is crossed and dotted with ancient river and lake beds, pointing to a warmer, wetter past. If life ever gained a foothold on the planet, traces may be found in its rocks as organic matter and possibly even fossilised organisms.</p> <p>Dr Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist and planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, and first author on the paper, said the unusual features on the rocks were accumulations of minerals, including an iron-phosphate mineral, vivianite, and an iron sulphide mineral, greigite.</p> <p>“These minerals appear to have formed as a result of reactions between the mud of the Bright Angel formation and organic matter that is also present in that mud,” he said. The reactions appeared to have taken place shortly after the mud was deposited on the lake bed.</p> <p>On Earth, reactions that combine organic matter and chemical compounds in mud to form new minerals, such as vivianite and greigite, are often driven by microbial activity. The microbes consume the organic compounds and produce the minerals as a byproduct of their metabolism.</p> <p>But there are other ways to produce the minerals. “The reason … we cannot claim this is more than a potential biosignature is that there are chemical processes that can cause similar reactions in the absence of biology and we cannot rule those processes out completely on the basis of rover data alone,” Hurowitz said.</p> <p>Hurowitz added: “We should be conservative and stick to the potential biosignature designation until future research and analysis on the sample collected from this geological formation can be performed on Earth.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/16/mars-meteorite-largest-auction\">Largest piece of Mars on Earth sells for over $5m at New York auction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers hope the findings will kickstart efforts in laboratories to see if the intriguing features can be recreated through biological and non-biological processes. They also want it to spur fieldwork at sites where similar reactions may have taken place in the past. That would help scientists work out whether the features are biology at work.</p> <p>Ultimately, confirmation may have to wait for Mars rocks, which have been stashed aboard Perseverance, to be brought back to Earth, but Nasa plans for such a mission are badly delayed and in doubt.</p> <p>Scientists have decried what they see as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/trump-nasa-cuts\">extinction-level cuts</a>” to Nasa’s science budget by the Trump administration, including the likely axing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/12/experts-split-over-nasa-mission-to-mars-costs-rocket\">Mars sample return mission</a> that would allow such analysis.</p> <p>Duffy, the transportation secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/sean-duffy-nasa-trump-appointment\">installed by Trump at Nasa</a> in July after withdrawing his initial nomination, refused to commit to bringing the rocks to Earth, and said it was the subject of “a current analysis”.</p> <p>“We’re looking at how we get this sample back, or other samples back,” Duffy said. “We’re going to look at our timing. And, you know, how do we spend money better, and what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly?”</p> <p>Fox appeared to press the case for more investment in Nasa’s scientific research in light of Wednesday’s announcement.</p> <p>“Nasa science discoveries do not just happen at random. They are the rewarding results of meticulous, long-term strategic planning,” she said.</p> <p>“We send these missions to really address these incredible questions, and each new discovery helps us drive what research is coming next.”</p> <p>In an accompanying article to the report, Dr Janice Bishop, a planetary scientist at the Seti Institute in California and Dr Mario Parente, an expert in remote sensing on planets at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said: “There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero crater.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Heidi Liddle told inquiry she felt ‘crushing’ guilt, while Leanne Lucas said she felt ‘ostracised’ from community</p>",
    "content": "<p>A dance teacher who led the Taylor Swift-themed children’s workshop which was attacked in Southport has described feeling “tortured” by a “crushing” guilt over the atrocity.</p> <p>Heidi Liddle, who shielded one little girl inside a bathroom during the attack, said the trauma of that day had “fractured every part of my brain and my life”.</p> <p>In tearful testimony to the inquiry being held at Liverpool town hall, Liddle said: “Although people have told me this incident is not my fault, the guilt I bear is crushing. I feel responsible.</p>    <p>“I tried so hard to usher as many children out as possible, to get them away from him [the attacker]. I constantly replay what happened over and over in my mind, what I was able to do, what else could I have done, the what ifs.”</p> <p>Her friend Leanne Lucas, with whom she led the workshop, said survival instincts had guided her decision to rush out of the building with children.</p> <p>Lucas, 35, phoned 999 in the “absolute chaos” of trying to escape after Axel Rudakubana stabbed her five times, fracturing her shoulder blade and cutting off parts of her spine. She fell unconscious from her injuries after calling for help.</p> <p>Occasionally breaking to stop her tears, the former primary school teacher said: “I acted in a way to find help as quickly as possible. Living with that knowledge is hard.”</p> <p>Since the attack, Lucas said, she had felt “ostracised” in Southport, her home town, and felt exposed and criticised for her actions: “To some I am called a hero, to others a villain. The truth is, I am neither. I am just Leanne, the woman who did her best in an unthinkable situation.”</p> <p>The attack had left her “excluded from parts of my own community”, she said, adding that she stayed away from events because her presence could distress the families of the children.</p> <p>Lucas added: “I don’t heal alongside or within my community. I feel ostracised in the very town where I built my life.”</p> <p>The inquiry, led by the former appeal court judge Sir Adrian Fulford, is examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six; Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven; and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine; and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.</p>    <p>Liddle, who was returning to work from maternity leave at the time, described how she frantically tried to usher children to safety as Rudakubana rained down blows with a 20cm (8in) kitchen knife.</p> <p>She saw Lucas being “brutally attacked” and ran with some of the girls to the stairway. One of the children, she noticed, had run in the opposite direction towards a toilet, so she quickly opened the door and locked them both inside.</p> <p>“Whilst in the toilet, the perpetrator was banging and rattling the door attempting to get in – only stopping when the police arrived,” she said. “The girls’ screaming and fearing for our lives haunts me to this day.”</p> <p>Through tears, the mother of two told the inquiry that she responded in a split second to the “most horrendous and terrifying situation I’ve ever been in, one I had never even imagined possible”.</p> <p>She added: “My instinct was to protect all of the girls; despite this, a part of me always questions if we could have done anything differently in those moments of terror.”</p> <p>Liddle said she felt her experience had been diminished during the police investigation as she was treated as a witness rather than a victim.</p> <p>She said: “Whilst I will always consider other people’s experiences and feelings that day above my own, this labelling made me feel like my own experience was immaterial, trivial or even worthless.” </p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The publisher of the Washington Post, Will Lewis, is facing fresh questions over his independence after a cache of leaked files revealed he gave extensive support to Boris Johnson as a secret political adviser when Johnson was prime minister.</p> \n<p>The files shed light on how the media executive, who at the time was vice-chair of the Associated Press news agency, worked behind the scenes with Johnson as his premiership was engulfed by a series of scandals.</p> \n<p>Lewis’s meetings with Johnson, which took place over a six-month period in 2022, were not disclosed in official transparency records, in an apparent breach of government rules.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-elon-musk-evening-standard-evgeny-lebedev\">Revealed: Boris Johnson approached Elon Musk on behalf of London Evening Standard owner Lebedev</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In July 2022, on the eve of Johnson’s announcement that he would resign from government, Lewis spent the day in 10 Downing Street and worked closely with Johnson and his advisers.</p> \n<p>Lewis appears to have arrived early in the morning, at 7.50am, and took part in at least six meetings during the day, including a gathering of Johnson’s aides to prepare him for prime minister’s questions (PMQs) in the House of Commons.</p> \n<p>In the meetings, which stretched into the evening, Lewis appears to have participated in gatherings of Johnson’s closest political allies, including several MPs and a senior minister, as the prime minister came under intense pressure to step down.</p> \n<p>Details of the extent of Lewis’s support for Johnson are revealed in official government logs that provide a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities. The logs are marked “official – sensitive”.</p> \n<p>The records are contained in the Boris Files, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">cache of documents</a> obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks, and seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>According to the files, Lewis spoke or met with the prime minister on at least 11 occasions between February and July 2022. In total, Lewis appears to have provided Johnson with at least 15 hours of political advice during this period.</p> \n<p>The exposure of the meetings raises questions for Lewis about his proximity to political power and whether his role advising a serving UK prime minister amounted to a conflict of interest with his role at AP.</p> \n<p>It also places a spotlight on Lewis’s relationship with Johnson, who nominated the media executive for a knighthood for “political and public service” after leaving office.</p> \n<p>Lewis was editor of the Daily Telegraph in the 2000s when Johnson was a columnist for the paper. Lewis then spent a decade at companies controlled by Rupert Murdoch, including the UK-based News Group Newspapers (NGN) when it was dealing with allegations of past phone hacking.</p> \n<p>His tenure at the Washington Post has been mired in controversy after allegations recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-company-ngn-actively-frustrated-met-phone-hacking-investigation-will-lewis\">emerged in court proceedings</a> that he was involved in an effort by NGN to “actively frustrate” a police inquiry into phone hacking. Lewis and NGN have strongly denied the allegations.</p> \n<p>A source close to Lewis said he “has been transparent about his personal relationship” with Johnson.</p> \n<p>An AP spokesperson said its board members provided oversight of AP’s executive leadership and had “no involvement” in its journalism. “Board directors hold a wide range of roles outside of AP,” they said.</p> \n<p>A Cabinet Office source said it was Johnson’s responsibility “to account for his meetings”. The former prime minister did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<h2>Frequent visitor</h2> \n<p>It has previously been reported that Lewis <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/paralysed-in-no-10-are-the-pm-and-his-wife-ready-to-let-it-go-2kdcnrhss\">provided informal advice</a> to Johnson. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/19/will-lewis-washington-post-publisher-boris-johnson-partygate\">reported last year</a> that he allegedly advised Johnson to “clean up” phone data relating to the Covid-19 rule-breaking scandal known as Partygate.</p> \n<p>Under ministerial rules, Johnson would have been expected to disclose any meeting held with a senior media executive, but Lewis does not appear in public transparency records.</p> \n<p>The omission has meant that the extent of Lewis’s involvement in shaping Johnson’s response to a rolling series of scandals that would end his term as prime minister was unknown until now.</p> \n<p>According to the leaked minute-by-minute logs, Lewis was a frequent visitor at Downing Street and Chequers, the prime minister’s official countryside residence, as Johnson fought in vain to save his premiership in 2022.</p> \n<p>Lewis first appears in the logs on 2 February when he joined a call with Johnson and a Conservative political strategist. After four of Johnson’s senior aides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark\">quit the next day</a>,<strong> </strong>Lewis joined several meetings in Downing Street on 4 February and he appears to have spent a part of the morning alone with the prime minister.</p> \n<p>At the time, Johnson was facing calls to resign amid dissent within his own party and a widening police investigation into lockdown-breaking parties.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">What are the Boris Files and what do they reveal about former PM’s conduct?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Johnson was able to withstand the pressure for several months longer, but in early July he became embroiled in a fresh scandal, sparking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/05/sajid-javid-and-rishi-sunak-quit-throwing-boris-johnsons-future-into-doubt\">resignations of two</a> of his most senior ministers.</p> \n<p>The day after, on 6 July, Lewis joined the prime minister’s first meeting of the day along with Ross Kempsell, then a close ally and political fixer to Johnson.</p> \n<p>Lewis remained at the prime minister’s side that morning. In the logs, officials recorded that Johnson was “in office with Will Lewis (vice-chair of the Associated Press)” along with two loyal ministers.</p> \n<p>Lewis attended additional meetings in Downing Street during the day as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/06/johnson-clings-on-amid-cabinet-standoff-and-dozens-of-resignations\">ministers quit</a> Johnson’s government en masse. He was also with Johnson in the evening as the prime minister and his advisers tried to salvage his position.</p> \n<p>On 7 July, Lewis again joined Johnson’s first meeting of the day, according to the logs, hours before the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/boris-johnson-resigns-as-conservative-leader-after-cabinet-revolt\">publicly announced</a> he would resign. Lewis continued to advise Johnson in the following days as the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/18/boris-johnson-defends-record-as-government-faces-confidence-vote\">faced a vote</a> of no confidence.</p> \n<p>He returned to Downing Street as Johnson prepared for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/20/tory-mps-indulge-in-a-mawkish-farewell-for-their-poundshop-arnie\">final appearance</a> as prime minister in the House of Commons.

    "content": "<p>Limited tube services ran on Wednesday as more staff turned up for work on the London Underground, while RMT strikes disrupted the capital for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/london-tube-strike-tfl-website-rmt\">third day this week</a>.</p> <p>No talks have taken place to resolve the dispute, with the RMT now demanding a summit with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, in its quest for a shorter working week.</p> <p>Some services, including parts of the Central, Northern and District lines, were partly running on Wednesday afternoon as more staff attended work than earlier in the week.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) hopes to run more trains again on Thursday, when controllers and signallers walk out on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/05/strikes-expected-london-tube-halt-four-days\">final day of strikes</a>.</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Eddie Dempsey, speaking at TUC Congress, called on Khan to meet the union. He said: “Stop going on social media, invite us to the meeting, let’s have a discussion, because I want to know what is going on in London.”</p> <p>He warned further strikes could follow. Speaking earlier to the BBC, he said: “We’ve got towards the end of a week of strike action, we’re open to negotiations, but there are no invitations to sit down with TfL. We’ll have to see what the next move is.”</p> <p>Dempsey said the RMT wanted to make “meaningful progress” towards its 32-hour week ambition and was prepared to “compromise and discuss” in negotiations.</p> <p>A TfL spokesperson said talks had not taken place as the RMT’s demand for a reduction in the working week had been ruled out as impractical and unaffordable.</p>    <p>Some of the gridlock seen during pre-Covid tube strikes was averted as commuters worked from home and used the Elizabeth line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/crossrail-elizabeth-line-opens-first-trains-london\">opened in 2022</a>. Growing numbers have also turned to bikes to navigate London’s congested roads – and even boats, avoiding the streets.</p> <p>Buses, the Elizabeth line and London Overground have taken on much of the strain, collectively carrying about 1 million extra passengers daily, according to TfL’s contactless data. Overall usage of TfL’s modes has been down about 20% compared with normal numbers, with many people either staying home or cycling.</p> <p>The capital’s ebike providers have been big beneficiaries of the strikes and an invaluable aid on gridlocked roads towards central London.</p> <p> Lime said it had an upsurge of 78% more hires than the previous Wednesday. Forest reported Tuesday morning rush-hour rides at four times normal levels and 20,000 new app downloads on Monday alone.</p> <p>TfL said its Santander cycle scheme also saw a surge with almost 20,000 hires by 3pm, up 93% on the usual figure.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Uber-branded Thames Clipper boats reported total passenger numbers up 66% on Tuesday compared with a week earlier.</p> <p>Most businesses, however, will be counting the cost. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank estimates the strikes dealt a £230m blow to the economy, excluding indirect effects such as lost productivity and lower retail spending. The Night Time Industries Association claimed the strikes could cost the leisure and entertainment sector £150m.</p> <p>Footfall in some of London’s main work and retail centres had fallen by almost a third, according to O2 mobile phone data. It said footfall across central London on Tuesday lunchtime was down 16% compared with a week earlier, with Canary Wharf down 31% and London Bridge and the City down 21%.</p> <p>TfL has advised passengers to check daily for service updates. A full tube service is not expected until 8am on Friday morning.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Snapchat has been accused by a Danish research organisation of leaving an “overwhelming number” of drug dealers to openly operate on Snapchat, making it easy for children to buy substances including cocaine, opioids and MDMA.</p> <p>The social media platform has said it proactively uses technology to filter out profiles selling drugs. However, research by Digitalt Ansvar (Digital Accountability), a Danish research organisation that promotes responsible digital development, has found evidence of a failure to moderate drug-related language in usernames. It also accused Snapchat of failing to respond adequately to reports of profiles openly selling drugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/10/controls-privacy-buy-childs-first-mobile-phone-safety\">Set controls and teach privacy: how to manage your child’s first mobile phone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Researchers used profiles of 13-year-olds and found a multitude of people selling drugs on Snapchat under usernames featuring keywords such as “coke”, “weed” and “molly”. When researchers reported 40 of these profiles to Snapchat, the company removed only 10 of them. The other 30 reports were rejected, they said.</p> <p>Snapchat said it had “proactively disabled” 75% of the accounts reported and had now disabled all of them.</p> <p>The investigation also found that despite previous criticism, Snapchat’s recommendation systems were spreading and promoting profiles of those selling illegal drugs to users – including to children who had not previously shown an interest in or interacted with drug-dealing profiles.</p> <p>Within a few hours, the researchers’ 13-year-old test profiles had recommendations to add up to 70 suspected drug-dealing profiles because one friend was connected to a drug-dealing profile.</p> <p>Digitalt Ansvar’s CEO, Ask Hesby Holm, said: “As a child or young person, you don’t need to search for these profiles yourself; you can have them recommended directly by Snapchat. That is deeply problematic.</p> <p>“Snapchat itself says they proactively use technology to filter out profiles that sell drugs on the platform. Our investigation shows this is not true. Snapchat hosts an overwhelming number of openly drug-related profiles and appears not to moderate either implicit or explicit drug-related language in usernames.”<br><br>This failure to moderate profiles with such obvious usernames, he said, meant that “children and young people have very easy access to buying drugs on Snapchat”. He added: “It’s not technology that’s lacking, it is will. Snapchat can easily filter such usernames.”</p> <p>According to Snapchat, in 2023 it had a 90% reach of 13- to 24-year-olds in the Nordics. Digitalt Ansvar accused Snapchat of breaking EU rules for digital services on the protection of children and called for authorities to act.</p> <p>A Snapchat spokesperson said: “We have zero tolerance for drug sales on Snapchat. Even though the accounts flagged in the study were not all reported in-app, more than 75% of those accounts had already been disabled by our teams before we were made aware of this report, and all accounts now have been.</p> <p>“At Snapchat, we are working diligently and have invested tremendous resources to stop drug dealers from abusing our platform. We deploy proactive detection to identify and disable these accounts, support law enforcement to bring dealers to justice, and educate our community about the dangers of drugs. Over the past year, we have proactively consulted law enforcement across Europe to identify new search terms and emojis used by criminals, aiming to enhance our proactive detection and maintain a hostile environment to drug dealers.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The chief executive of the Kingsmill owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has warned Rachel Reeves not to give consumer sentiment “another whack” in her upcoming budget, despite signalling that food price rises had peaked and will now start to ease.</p> <p>George Weston, the chief executive of the ABF conglomerate which also owns the fashion chain Primark and produces sugar and cooking ingredients, said recent food price inflation had been driven by employers passing on increases to labour costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">announced in Reeves’ first budget as chancellor</a> last year.</p> <p>He said most retailers had now passed these costs on and “food inflation will be gradually easing from now” as the cost of commodities was “pretty benign”.</p>    <p>Grocery inflation stood at 5% in August, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">latest data</a> from analysts Worldpanel, contributing to wider inflation, which rose to 3.8% in July.</p> <p>He added that Primark had not raised clothing prices in a year as it had been able to offset higher labour costs with more technology, such as self-service tills and lower freight and cotton prices.</p> <p>Weston said given the higher food prices, Primark’s shoppers had kept a tighter rein on spending than more affluent consumers.</p> <p>“We had to work very hard to earn our shoppers’ money, as we are not in an easy consumer environment,” he said, with sales in the UK and Ireland rising by 1% over the six months to 13 September, helped by new store openings.</p> <p>But shares in ABF slid more than 13% on Wednesday as analysts said trading at Primark’s mainland Europe outlets had been worse than hoped. The company also warned that sugar profits would be below expectations. ABF’s sugar business, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/uks-largest-bioethanol-plant-to-shut-after-blow-from-starmers-trade-deal-with-trump\">closing Vivergo ethanol plant</a>, is also likely to make a £40m loss, much deeper than feared.</p> <p>The company said group sales are expected to have fallen by 2% at established Primark stores in the six months to 13 September, with sales flat at established UK stores and sales falls in Germany, France and Italy.</p> <p>Weston blamed “political turmoil” in France, which was the worst performing country, and consumer uncertainty elsewhere in Europe amid the Ukraine war and inflation.</p> <p>Weston said Primark was “trading very strongly” as a seasonal change in the weather had led to demand for warmer clothing and it had sharpened up its fashion ranges, particularly on denim.</p> <p>He said that Primark continued to gain market share in a flat UK market despite heavy competition from Shein, the Chinese-founded online fashion seller.</p> <p>Many retailers fear Reeves will impose further tax increases on businesses in her 26 November budget. Weston said: “I hope consumer sentiment doesn’t take another great whack in November … anything that reduces returns on investment or increases the costs of employing people [could affect sentiment]”.</p> <p>Weston said he would like to see Reeves’ November budget “closing that big loophole around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/06/shein-uk-singapore-tax-fashion\">de minimis”</a> – a tax break that allows Shein and others to import items worth less than £135 direct to consumers without paying customs duty.</p> <p>“I don’t like to be faced with competition that has an unfair advantage which could be costing the Treasury maybe £100m a year,” he said. “A lot of money is being left on the table unnecessarily.”</p> <p>He also called on the chancellor to revise plans to increase business rates for large high street stores.</p>",

There were no reports to any injuries to the driver or damage to the vehicle at this time,” the PSNI said.</p> \n<p>Officers had gathered evidence and would review the video footage to determine whether any offences had been committed, police said. “There will be an increased policing presence in the area, with officers continuing to engage with relevant partner agencies.”</p> \n<p>Police said “self-appointed patrols”, a reference to vigilantes, would not be tolerated.</p> \n<p>Deirdre Hargey, a Sinn Féin assembly member, called the incidents deplorable. “This is yet another example of the disgusting, sporadic racist violence which we have seen across the city,” she said.</p> \n<p>A simmering campaign against foreigners and people of colour in Belfast and other parts of county Antrim has escalated since the anti-migrant riots in England last year.</p> \n<p>Groups have put up threatening posters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/04/catholic-and-african-residents-targeted-by-paint-bombs-in-county-antrim\">smashed property</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/19/ballymena-impact-anti-migrant-riots-northern-ireland\">burned homes</a>, forcing families to flee.

    "description": "<p>Number of attempts to cross Channel has been particularly high for several days, say French authorities</p>",
    "content": "<p>Four people including two children have died in two separate incidents while trying to cross the Channel to the UK in the past 24 hours, while three others are missing in a third incident.</p> <p>On Tuesday night off the coast of Sangatte, France, three people lost their lives while travelling on a dinghy with 38 people onboard. Three others are missing after an incident in Neufchâtel-Hardelot, France, on a boat with 115 people onboard.</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon a woman was confirmed dead after a rescue attempt on the UK side of the Channel. The woman was airlifted to Dover but her life could not be saved.</p> <p>The deaths come days after the former home secretary Yvette Cooper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/01/women-children-home-office-refugee-family-reunions-uk-politics-live-latest-updates-news\">announced</a> the suspension of refugee family reunion, a safe route used mainly by women and children to reunite with immediate family members granted refugee status in the UK.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the first forced removals of small boat arrivals under the Anglo-French “one in, one out” deal are due to take place on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week on Air France flights.</p> <p>The plan proposes that for each migrant the UK returns to France, another person with a strong case for asylum in Britain will be allowed to stay.</p> <p>About 100 people were thought to have been detained for the “out” part of the deal, including victims of trafficking and torture, as well as children who were wrongly classified as adults and were later released.</p> <p>Those detained include people from conflict zones such as Sudan, Libya and Eritrea. Speaking from a detention centre on Wednesday, one person from Eritreasaid: “Everybody has been crying since we received the letters telling us when we will be sent to France. It is a punishment to be sent there.”</p> <p>According to the French authorities, Channel crossing attempts have been particularly high for several days along the Boulogne coast. On Sunday, 1,097 people crossed the Channel to the UK in 17 boats.</p> <p>French media outlet La Voix Du Nord has reported that of the three people confirmed dead, two are from Vietnam and one is Egyptian.</p> <p>Laurent Touvet, préfet of Pas-de-Calais, said it was “a difficult and tragic night” and added: “Smuggler networks bear the responsibility for these tragedies. The state is determined to combat them.”</p> <p>However, NGOs working with people in northern France hoping to cross the Channel to the UK take a different view.</p> <p>Lachlan Macrae of Calais Food Collective said: “These crossings are becoming deadlier in large part due to increased policing on the French side and a lack of safe routes to the UK. People trying to cross are now hiding their lifejackets in bin bags or under blankets to avoid being targeted by the French police. Responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the UK and French governments.”</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “Four people dying in the Channel in the past 24 hours, including two children, is another heartbreaking and needless loss of life.</p> <p>“People only risk crossing the Channel when what they are fleeing is more terrifying than the dangers ahead. Every day, our frontline teams meet men, women and children who had no choice but to flee their homes in war-torn countries and leave everything behind in search of safety, even if that meant separating from their families.”</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/europe?region_incident=All&amp;route=3896&amp;incident_date%5Bmin%5D=&amp;incident_date%5Bmax%5D=\">International Organisation for Migration</a>, 85 people died trying to cross the Channel in 2024, and from the beginning of 2025 until 15 August, a further 24 deaths were recorded.</p> <p>Thousands of people have crossed the Channel in small boats since the “one in, one out” agreement with France took effect in August, according to Home Office figures. </p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: “We are aware of reports of an incident in the Channel in French territorial waters. French authorities are leading the response and investigation. We will not be commenting further at this stage.”</p> <p>More than 30,000 people have reached the UK in small boats so far in 2025, and more than 50,000 have crossed since Labour came into power in July 2024.</p>",

Compared to a year earlier, producer prices were up by 2.6%.</p> <p>The core measure, excluding food and energy which can be volatile, also fell by 0.1% in August from the previous month, while economists had expected a 0.3% gain.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Brown</strong>, deputy chief North America economist at Capita Economics, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The downside surprise to the PPI in August was driven by a compression of trade margins, reversing their unexpected widening in July, and therefore overstates the softness of producer prices. Nonetheless, the big picture remains that tariff effects are feeding through only slowly…</p> <p>There is little for the Fed to worry about in terms of the PPI components that feed into the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] deflator, which were on the whole in line with their averages in recent months. Accordingly, ahead of the more important consumer prices index release tomorrow, our preliminary estimate is that the core PCE deflator rose by 0.25% month on month. That would be above the target-consistent rate of roughly 0.17% m/m and might, at the margin at least, quell talk of a 50bp [interest rate] cut next week. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c166e98f08d80fd0f1141d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-10T11:58:16.984Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Peter Kyle in Beijing for UK's first trade talks with China in seven years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The newly appointed business secretary, <strong>Peter Kyle</strong>, is in Beijing for the UK’s first trade talks with the country in seven years in an attempt to revitalise economic relations.</p> <p>As part of a two day programme he held a bilateral with <strong>Li Lecheng</strong>, the minister of industry and information technology on Wednesday morning as part of a revived industrial cooperation dialogue, a Sino-British relationship format that has not sat since 2022.</p> <p>The ministry is responsible for industrial policy but also telecoms and the internet, which is heavily censored in China.</p> <p>Tomorow Kyle, who was only promoted to the post on Friday, will have a day long programme with China’s long-standing commerce minister <strong>Wang Wentao</strong> including a bilateral in the morning, followed by a meeting of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission (Jetco) which has not sat for seven years.</p> <p>It will end with a joint dinner where the ministers will be joined by Chinese and British businesses.</p> <p>Kyle is the ninth government representative to visit China since Labour were elected to power last year with hopes that the trip will unlock an export market worth more than £1bn over five years, according to a statement from the department for business and trade.</p>    <p>Restarting trade talks with China was “an essential tool to put money into people’s pockets,” said Kyle.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ahead of the Jetco meeting, the department for business and trade (DBT) unveiled <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-wins-to-china-2024-to-2025-confirmed-results\">new deals and market openings for British interests worth £2bn</a>.</p> <p>These include a new three-season TV deal for the Premier League and marketing opportunities for companies ranging from <strong>Eve Lom</strong> cosmetics to <strong>Hayman’s</strong> gin distillery and <strong>Aedas</strong> architecture firm which has previously been involved in buildings such as Kong Kong’s West Kowloon rail station and the giant Sina Plaza science park in Beijing.</p> <p>The department also pointed to China being a “huge market” for British cars and for porcine genetics, a pig breeding programme, cattle hides and sheep skins.</p> <p>The UK is looking to China to achieve much-needed economic growth but so far the trading relationship does not reflect the size of the country.</p> <p><strong>Sam Goodman</strong>, senior policy director at Chinese Strategic Risks Institute, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The export wins DBT secured in the last year with China and Hong Kong accounts less 0.2% of total annual UK exports.

One US official said, according to the FT:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’re ready to go, ready to go right now, but we’re only going to do this if our European partners step up with us.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meanwhile, Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk announced that it will cut 9,000 jobs and trimmed its profit forecast for this year, as it struggles against competition from US rival Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight loss injection.</strong></p> <p>The job cuts amount to 11% of the drugmaker’s workforce of 78,400. About 5,000 of the job losses will happen in Denmark.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916424#\">Novo Nordisk said the move would save 8bn Danish kroner</a> (£930m) a year, although it will also lead to one-off costs of 8bn kroner this year. As a result, it expects to deliver operating profit growth of 4% to 10% at constant exchange rates, down from 10%—16%.</p> <p>It is the first major move by <strong><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">Mike Doustdar</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">, an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessman</a>, who took over as chief executive last month. Novo Nordisk – which had become Europe’s most valuable company on the back of the weight loss drug boom – recently lost two thirds of its market value following disappointing drug trial results and slowing sales.</p> <p>Doustdar said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-<br>driven. Our company must evolve as well.</p> <p>It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy in reducing weight. Novo’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p> <p><strong>Asian stock markets rose while government bonds fell, after weaker US labour market data heightened expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut of at least a quarter point next week.</strong></p> <p>Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.87% higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed by 1.1% and South Korea’s Kospi rose by 1.67%.</p> <p>US government bonds fell for a second day on Wednesday, pushing yields higher.

They say the social media company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and offers a line of VR headsets and games, deleted or doctored internal safety research that showed children being exposed to grooming, sexual harassment and violence in its 3D realms.</p> <p>“Meta knew that underage children were using its products, but figured, ‘Hey, kids drive engagement,’ and it was making them cash,” Jason Sattizahn, one of the whistleblowers who worked on the company’s VR research, said in a statement. “Meta has compromised their internal teams to manipulate research and straight-up erase data that they don’t like.”</p> <p>Sattizahn and the other whistleblowers, all current or former Meta employees, have disclosed these findings and a trove of documents to Congress, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/08/meta-research-child-safety-virtual-reality/\">the Washington Post</a>, which first reported the allegations.

The whistleblowers say company managers instructed staff to avoid research that might show evidence of child harm in virtual reality.</p> <p>In one instance, a researcher was reportedly told to “swallow that ick”.</p> <p>In another instance, a researcher was allegedly told to delete information from an interview they had conducted with a German family, according to the Washington Post. During that interview, a teenage boy told the researcher that his brother, who was under the age of 10, had “frequently encountered strangers” in Meta’s VR and that “adults had sexually propositioned his little brother”.</p> <p>The allegations arise as a steady procession of former Meta employees have<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/07/1211339737/meta-failed-to-address-harm-to-teens-whistleblower-testifies-as-senators-vow-act\"> come forward to criticize the company</a> for not doing enough to protect children from harm on its social media products.

    "description": "<p>Company also augments AirPods earbuds with live translation and reveals upgrades to Apple Watch</p>",
    "content": "<p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> debuted its<strong> </strong>latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> on Tuesday, trumpeting the smartphone’s slimmest design yet.<strong> </strong>The device, named the iPhone Air, is one of several upgrades the company unveiled<strong> </strong>at its annual product showcase, promoted with the title “awe-dropping”. The event kicked off at 10am PT with the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, speaking in front of its Cupertino headquarters.</p> <p>“Design is at the core of everything we do,” Cook said. The CEO touted the company’s thin iPhone, which sports a width of 5.6mm, as the “biggest leap ever” for the device, which first debuted in 2007. Cook said that Apple had set a “new standard” for the gadget industry back then and “today we’re raising the bar once again” with its iPhone 17 lineup.</p> <p>The skinny phone is made of “spacecraft titanium”, has a 6.5in display and comes in a palette of colors that “evoke lightness”, the company says. Apple executives who spoke at Tuesday’s event promised that, despite the phone’s thinness, it will be durable and crack-resistant. They added that the phone also comes with the same fast-charging battery, wifi and features as its thicker phones.</p> <p>The iPhone Air will retail for $999, with preorders starting on Friday in advance of general availability on 19 September. Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup also includes standard, Pro and Pro Max editions. The company announced refreshes of the other versions of the smartphone on Tuesday as well, focusing on their cameras, processing speeds and battery life. The front-facing cameras in the new iPhones will ship with a dual filming mode that will capture the view from both the front and rear-facing lenses. The iPhone lineup will also come with additional storage capacity.</p> <p>Cook<strong> </strong>also introduced new versions of Apple’s signature white earphones and Apple Watch.<strong> </strong>The latest version of earphones, the AirPods Pro 3, comes with boosted noise cancellation and in five sizes of adjustable earpiece.</p> <p>The biggest feature coming to the new AirPods is live translation, allowing wearers to hear a translated version of a conversation with a person speaking another language. The earbuds go on sale on 19 September and will run for $249. The update brings Apple in line with its competitor Google, which added the translation feature to its Pixel Buds headphones years ago.</p> <p>Apple also revealed the Apple Watch series 11 with updated versions of the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch SE . The lineup of watches comes with new health features geared towards improving hypertension and sleep. The company said the former feature will notify wearers of possible hypertension, which Apple expects to do for at least 1 million people this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/27/apples-triple-threat-tariffs-ai-troubles-and-a-fortnite-fail\">Apple’s triple threat: tariffs, AI troubles and a Fortnite fail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Looming over the new product announcements are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a>, which threaten to disrupt the iPhone’s complex global supply chain with large price hikes, particularly the steep levy on China that is still under negotiation. Consumers may be forced to shoulder the burden of increased costs if they wish to upgrade. However, Cook has so far dodged doomsday predictions of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/iphone-apple-trump-tariffs-tech-us-china\">$2,000 iPhone</a>, shifting a major portion of Apple’s production to India from China and flying hundreds of tonnes of iPhones into the US ahead of the tariffs’ effective date.</p> <p>Investors and iPhone owners alike had been watching for mentions of Apple Intelligence, the suite of features meant to bring generative artificial intelligence to the iPhone that rolled out in October 2024 to mixed reception. Among last year’s announcements was a pledged overhaul of the virtual Siri that never materialized, a rare unfulfilled promise from Apple. During Tuesday’s event this week, Cook and others made scant mentions of the iPhone’s generative AI features.</p> <p> In a July earnings call, Cook said the company was “making good progress on a more personalized Siri” and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/31/apple-earnings-report\">promised a release next year</a>. Apple has also reportedly engaged in talks with Google about using the latter’s Gemini AI models to revamp Siri, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri\">Bloomberg</a>, much like how Google provides the search engine for Safari.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts have come to see Apple as lagging behind other Silicon Valley giants on artificial intelligence, particularly Google, which has already infused its flagship Pixel line of phones with features powered by AI.</p>",

Think again.</p> <p>Eliminating migration for the coming decade would actually leave property prices 2.3% higher by the mid-2030s than would be the case under a “base case” of migration continuing as expected, according to economic modelling by KPMG; and there are other negative economic consequences too.</p> <p>The temporary post-lockdown surge in net migration is now on the wane, but it appears to have left behind a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/02/how-neo-nazis-used-the-shield-of-ordinary-mums-and-dads-at-australia-anti-immigration-rallies-to-sell-white-supremacy-ntwnfb\">heightened level of national sensitivity</a> to the issue.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.jwsresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/True-Issues-36-November-2024-1.pdf\">a survey by JWS Research</a> from November last year suggested 78% of Australians thought housing access and affordability was now a “national crisis”.</p> <p>That’s hardly shocking.</p> <p>What was perhaps more surprising was that <a href=\"https://www.jwsresearch.com/latest-true-issues-research-standard-of-living-perceptions-australians-engagement-with-the-us-election-and-our-regular-issues-tracking/\">67% of respondents agreed</a> with the statement that Australia should reduce its migration intake to reduce pressure on the housing market (70% backed the other option of providing incentives for people to move to the regions).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/PAwRd/1/\" data-alt=\"Graph of annual growth in Australia’s population\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/PAwRd/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>These may be leading questions, but it shows how Australians are ready to blame immigrants for their various woes – particularly when it comes to emotive issues such as housing.</p> <p>The right of politics has been keen to exploit these concerns, especially given the Albanese government’s unwillingness to articulate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/07/those-angry-about-migration-figures-are-ignoring-what-happened-in-australia-during-covid-and-other-key-facts\">a longer-term strategy for migration</a>.</p> <p>The chief economist at KPMG, Brendan Rynne, shares the consensus view among economists that migration has been good for the Australian economy.</p> <p>In an ageing society with a productivity problem, migrants are typically younger and better educated, and they bring new skills and ideas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>As a thought experiment, Guardian Australia asked Rynne to model the impact of reducing population growth to just births minus deaths over the coming decade.</p> <p>In this scenario, the population would grow at about 0.4% a year, instead of the predicted rate of 1.3% with migration.</p> <p>As a result of this change, there would be 29 million residents by 2035, instead of 31.2 million.</p> <p>That’s 2.2 million fewer people in this “no migration” scenario.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the economy with closed borders is 2.4% smaller in a decade’s time than one with migration, the model shows.</p> <p>On the other hand, a smaller labour force means employers have to compete harder to attract workers.</p> <p>That means wages would be 7.5% higher after 10 years of no migration, and the unemployment rate would be 0.2 percentage points lower than the base case.</p> <p>Rynne said his modelling suggested “pulling back population growth to just natural increases for the next decade is not a great outcome for Australia”.</p> <p>“Would it be diabolical? Not really. But the point is losses start to become wider at the end of the decade so the longer you maintain the hardline approach to population growth the worse it becomes over time.”</p> <p>In fact, with Australian women having 1.6 children on average – lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 – the population would eventually begin to shrink, threatening the economic stagnation that haunts countries like Japan and Italy.</p> <p>Then there’s the budgetary impact.</p> <p>Lower population growth would seriously damage our capacity to pay for the essential services Australians demand, especially as they get older.</p> <p>Instead of approaching a balanced budget by the mid-2030s (as is the current projection), the deficit widens to $87bn, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office’s build-your-own-budget tool.</p> <p>Total debt surpasses $2tn by June 2035; $437bn more than in a world where net migration continues as expected.</p> <p>And house prices?</p> <p>As mentioned, they are cumulatively 2.3% higher in a decade’s time than would have been under the base case of migration evolving as currently expected, the modelling shows.</p> <p>To be clear: that’s not that prices will be 2.3% higher than they are today; that’s the <em>additional</em> price growth after a decade.</p> <p>That’s because, Rynne says, the lower demand for housing is overwhelmed by the drop in the number of workers available to build homes.</p> <p>And higher wages also means higher inflation, which gobbles up the benefits of more pay.</p> <p>These are obviously stylised results, but they paint the picture of how slashing migration would flow through to growth, housing, the workforce and the budget.</p> <p>Migration is not the cure to all our economy’s ills, but in the long run a well managed program does more economic good than harm.</p> <p>• Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editor</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 September 2025 to clarify that the 2.3% increase in house prices was on top of the total price growth if current migration rates continue as expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>Police were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/08/heathrow-airport-terminal-evacuated-because-of-possible-hazardous-material\">called to Heathrow late on Monday</a> afternoon when 21 people fell ill in Terminal 4. Initial reports suggested a hazardous material could be involved and part of the airport was evacuated. But when the emergency services conducted a thorough search, no trace of any adverse substance was found.</p> <p>A source within the Metropolitan police subsequently suggested the event could be something quite different – <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5ypl5grg24t?post=asset%3Ade5d98cd-78ad-42af-882a-6e6371cb97d8#post\">a case of mass hysteria</a>. And some experts agree.</p> <p>“What happened at Heathrow is almost certainly an episode of mass psychogenic illness that is anxiety-based,” said Dr Robert Bartholomew, a University of Auckland sociologist who is an expert on the subject.</p> <p>While “mass hysteria” might bring to mind medieval reports of <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/dancing-plagues-and-mass-hysteria\">dancing plagues and epidemics of “possession”</a>, such events are not unknown in the modern world.</p> <p>The term, which has historical stigma and is often erroneously applied to situations from crowd crushes to moral panics, has gone out of use. Such events are now known as “mass psychogenic illness” or “mass sociogenic illness”, which take two main forms – those that are “motor-based” and others that are “anxiety-based”.</p> <p>Among examples of the former was a case in 2011 at LeRoy high school in New York, where affected students displayed vocal and motor tics such as twitches and spasms. While some feared an environmental toxin was at play, experts diagnosed the situation as a case of mass psychogenic illness, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us/schools-end-clears-up-new-york-students-mystery-twitching-idUSBRE85M0DG/\">aggravated by participation in social or traditional media.</a></p> <p>“These outbreaks occur in an atmosphere of anxiety that can span weeks or months. The long-term stress disrupts the nerves and neurons that send messages from the brain,” said Bartholomew, citing a notorious 1692 outbreak in Salem, Massachusetts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/carol-morley-the-falling-mass-hysteria-is-a-powerful-group-activity\">Carol Morley: ‘Mass hysteria is a powerful group activity’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said anxiety-based cases were typically triggered by the sudden perception of a toxic agent – such as an unfamiliar smell. “Common symptoms include headache, overbreathing, dizziness and fainting,” he said, noting episodes tended to come out of the blue with victims often recovering within minutes.</p> <p>It is this type of event that Bartholomew believes occurred at Heathrow. “I always say you have to investigate first before you render the diagnosis of mass psychogenic illness,” he said.</p> <p>“But they have gone there and they’ve tested, and they’ve tested negative. [And there was], rapid onset and recovery, benign, transient symptoms.” </p> <p>He added: “I suspect the person taken to hospital may have had a pre-existing condition and it was likely done as a precaution.”</p> <p>If the diagnosis of mass psychogenic illness is correct, it would not be the first time an airport has been linked to such an event: Bartholomew investigated a case at Melbourne airport in 2005 when 57 people fell ill<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-02-21/dozens-treated-after-suspected-airport-gas-leak/1522704\"> after reporting a “gassy smell</a>”. Bartholomew<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16336130/\"> </a>said a toxic agent could have caused some of the individuals to become unwell but all the signs strongly suggested mass psychogenic illness.</p> <p>Such events might not be uncommon. <a href=\"https://www.simonwessely.com/Downloads/Publications/Other_p/154.pdf\">In a 2010 study</a>, researchers randomly selected 280 of 747 reports of chemical incidents from the UK’s former health protection agency, finding 19 were probable episodes of mass psychogenic illness. Again, the researchers found odour was a robust predictor of such events, while schools and healthcare facilities were common settings.</p> <p>“A substantial minority of chemical incidents may be mass psychogenic illness,” they concluded.</p> <p>Prof Sir Simon Wessely of King’s College London, who was part of the team, said it was “a bit early” to come to judgments about the Heathrow event and it was unclear whether there was an unusual odour or what investigations were done to eliminate other causes. But he added: “If all these come to nothing, then yes, this may be an episode of what we now call mass sociogenic illness.”</p> <p>Bartholomew stressed the illness was not a mental disorder and victims were not psychologically disturbed.</p> <p>“It is best described as a collective stress reaction that is based on a belief. We all have beliefs, therefore we are all potential victims,” he said. “It is not ‘all in their heads’ in the sense that they are experiencing real symptoms.” </p> <p>Wessely added: “Study after study has never found anything different about those who are affected from those who aren’t. All of us can experience anxiety in certain symptoms, and all of us can mistake these physiological symptoms, which can be easily explained by basic physiology for evidence of something else – such as a chemical, toxin etc. And we know these can spread very quickly in crowded environments, usually by rumour and also line of sight.”</p> <p>Wessely said there was nothing unusual about the events at terminal 4 on Monday: “It happens all over the world every day, particularly in crowded spaces like schools, concerts, crowds, factory floors etc. The only reason this made the news was because of the fact it was at Heathrow and led to major flight disruptions.”</p> <p>• The headline of this article was amended on 9 September 2025 to better reflect the content of the story. A link was added in the subheading to later reporting of police finding a substance they said was “thought to have caused a reaction to those within the airport”.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Half-year profits at Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, have more than halved as buyer demand comes under pressure from concerns over the economy, affordability struggles and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4\">slower-than-hoped interest rate cuts</a>.</p> <p>The company, which owns Bovis Homes, Countryside and Linden Homes, said its pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell by 55% to £40.9m.</p> <p>The slump in profits, which on an adjusted basis fell by a third to £80.6m, pushed the housebuilder’s share price down as much as 8% in early trading, before recovering to 4% down on Wednesday.</p> <p>Vistry completed 6,889 homes, down by 12% from the 7,792 completed a year earlier. Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn.</p> <p>“While we reported some positive momentum in the first quarter, market conditions softened somewhat in the second quarter, reflecting increased macro concerns and ongoing affordability challenges, particularly for first-time buyers, with expected interest rate cuts being pushed further out,” the builder said.</p> <p>Vistry said its forward order book was lower than a year ago, standing at £4.3bn against £5.1bn this time last year.</p> <p>It added that it was looking to boost flagging demand with sales and marketing initiatives. It is offering private buyers discounts of up to 5% on the sale price.</p> <p>“We are looking to drive an improvement in our open market sales rate in the second half through our sales and marketing initiatives albeit we remain mindful that demand will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties,” it said.</p> <p>Prices rose by 3% for private open market sales in the first half to £389,000 on average but it said sales rates were flat.</p> <p>The Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% in August but economists are expecting further reductions to come at a far slower pace amid stubbornly high inflation.</p> <p>However, Vistry was upbeat, saying it remained on track to meet full-year expectations.</p> <p>The company formed a long-term joint venture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/08/chinese-export-growth-slowest-six-months-shipments-us-fall-amid-tariff-tensions-oil-prices-climb-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68be9a6a8f0884821221bbd3#block-68be9a6a8f0884821221bbd3\">with the UK’s housing agency</a>, Homes England, earlier this week. The new vehicle, Hestia, is backed<strong> </strong>by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/23/labour-plans-to-build-15m-homes-will-that-help-britons-struggling-for-good-housing\">pledged</a> to build 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing.</p> <p>In June, the then housing secretary, Angela Rayner, announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/25/reeves-to-put-2bn-into-affordable-housing-to-sweeten-the-pill-of-cuts\">massive boost to the government’s affordable housing programme</a>, almost doubling funding to £39bn over the next decade.</p> <p>“The new social affordable homes programme provides an unprecedented level of funding for affordable housing over the next 10 years,” said Greg Fitzgerald, the Vistry chief executive. </p> <p>Vistry has shifted towards building social and affordable homes for its partners; it<a href=\"https://www.vistrygroup.co.uk/our-partnerships-model/our-partnerships-model#:~:text=A%20UNIQUE%20STRATEGIC%20ADVANTAGE,that%20is%20what%20we%20receive.%E2%80%9D\"> pre-sells at least 50% of new homes</a> on its developments to housing associations, local authorities and private rented sector providers.</p> <p>Anthony Codling, a housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: “[Private rented sector] investors continue to drive a hard bargain, leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding; so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way.</p> <p>“We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders.”</p>",

The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,” she writes.</p> <p>“The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago.”</p> <p>The party’s manifesto <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">states</a>: “Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.”</p> <p>As well as suggesting Reeves revisit Labour’s promises on personal taxation, Newton-Smith calls for the reform of business rates, VAT thresholds for small firms and stamp duty.</p> <p>Reeves used her maiden budget last October to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-bets-on-public-spending-increases-in-budget-winning-over-voters\">a £40bn package of tax increases</a>, including a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions that was widely criticised by businesses and has been blamed for helping fuel inflation.</p> <p>The chancellor subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/03/rachel-reeves-i-was-wrong-to-say-no-big-tax-rises-would-be-needed\">promised not to return with further tax </a>rises, saying “there’s no need to come back with another budget like this” and “we’ll never need to do that again.”</p> <p>However, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts, after a review of its optimistic-looking expectations for productivity.</p> <p>This shift, coming after costly U-turns on welfare reform and the winter fuel allowance, could leave the Treasury looking for £20bn-£30bn in revenue in five years’ time to put Reeves on course to meet her fiscal rules.</p> <p>Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, agreed with Newton Smith that finding £20bn or more within the constraints of the manifesto would be problematic.</p> <p>“Raising that amount without touching taxes that account for three-quarters of the UK’s tax base risks distorting behaviour, loading excessive pain on to small groups, and harming economic growth,” she said. “Manifesto pledges are important, but there’s a point at which they cause more harm than they’re worth.”</p> <p>Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her determination to stick to the pledges in recent weeks, however, as speculation has mounted about potential tax rises.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are protecting payslips for working people by keeping our promise not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.” </p> <p>As well as calling for tax changes, Newton-Smith also reiterates the CBI’s concerns about the government’s employment rights legislation, which she argues is deterring firms from hiring.</p> <p>Angela Rayner was widely viewed as the champion of the employment rights package inside government and lobbying from business groups to water down aspects of the bill has intensified since Rayner’s resignation last week.</p> <p>“The employment rights bill in its current form will<em> </em>add cost and complexity, is already leading some firms to put hiring plans on ice, and risks making it even harder to bring people back into work,” Newton Smith says.</p> <p>The bill includes immediate protection from unfair dismissal, after a yet-to-be determined probationary period, the right to regular hours, and the right for unions to access workplaces.</p> <p>Union leaders gathering in Brighton for the TUC conference on Tuesday said Labour had sought to issue reassurances that the party was still committed to the landmark bill.</p> <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who is standing in the contest to succeed Rayner as deputy Labour leader, told delegates on Tuesday: “One year ago we were elected to deliver this employment rights bill, and congress that is what we will do. We will not accept any watering down by the Lords. Forward with the employment rights bill in full. No ifs, no buts.”</p> <p>One union leader said ministers risked blowing up relations with the labour movement at a difficult moment for the government, and would need to retain its workers’ rights plan to show a key point of difference with Nigel Farage’s Reform. “They are not going to want to go to party conference fighting with us,” the leader argued.</p> <p>Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said the government reshuffle had created “anxiety” at the Brighton conference, but that he believed Labour would push ahead with a policy that sought to bridge business and union demands.</p> <p>“We need to take business with us on this journey, the re-regulation of the labour market is necessary and not up for debate, but, you know, we know what it’s like to have been on the wrong end of getting things done to us for 14 years.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle in the wake of Rayner’s departure, partly aimed at bolstering the government’s growth agenda.</p> <p>At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the prime minister told colleagues they should be ready to “move from fixing the foundations to driving forward the growth and national renewal that delivers for working people”, according to a readout from his official spokesperson.</p>",

    "title": "How to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg review – spinning Silicon Valley",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/how-to-save-the-internet-by-nick-clegg-review-spinning-silicon-valley",
    "description": "<p>Instead of recognising that social media harms mental health and democracy, the former deputy PM and Meta executive repeats company talking points</p>",
    "content": "<p>Nick Clegg chooses difficult jobs. He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as&nbsp;well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.</p> <p>The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one caused <em>by</em> the internet; it is the threat <em>to</em> the internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself or Meta or big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I&nbsp;believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”</p> <p>But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a&nbsp;defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”</p> <p>As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/social-media-smartphones-harm-regret.html\">asked questions rather like these</a> to a&nbsp;nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/opinion/parents-smartphones-tiktok-facebook.html\">survey of parents</a>, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still. <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2023-131/\">Other researchers</a> <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/flrnzo5x/public-attitudes-to-smartphones-social-media-and-online-safety-1.pdf\">have made similar findings</a>.</p> <p>In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.</p> <p>Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the many <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344657/\">studies</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.afterbabel.com/p/phone-based-childhood-cause-epidemic\">other side</a>. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word from <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/what-the-research-on-social-medias-impact-on-democracy-and-daily-life-says-and-doesnt-say/\">a rebuttal essay</a> that Meta put out in 2022 in response to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/\">one of my essays</a> laying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Clegg’s claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational is contradicted by dozens of Meta employees, contractors, whistleblowers, and leaked documents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. From <a href=\"https://nmag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-12-05-NM-v.-Meta-et-al.-COMPLAINT-REDACTED.pdf\">the brief</a> filed by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns. Clegg added his own plea at the top, saying that it was “increasingly urgent” to address “concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health”. Clegg noted that the company’s “well-being work is both understaffed and fragmented”. Zuckerberg did not respond to the email.</p> <p>Clegg’s current claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational, and that the correlations are too small to be taken seriously, is contradicted by dozens of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/instagram-facebook-teens-harassment-safety-5d991be1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhLPDbur4ZFYz8cmU2vAw5IYMWJcer0GzaSrNr6953kbMYmANwL_DZVnEYdVHE%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68a876be&amp;amp;gaa_sig=t3oiF4NImhbvazvhDAez5nyDMK8SVM_H3hwEhdZ_qnDCZ8GLDQlcStMk3hK42hn37YAguvcYKkA5QvmGsRQjHg%3D%3D\">Meta employees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/tracker/new-mexico-v-meta-inc-and-mark-zuckerberg/\">contractors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7,article_inline\">whistleblowers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/Doc%2073-2%20Complaint%20%28limited%20redactions%29%20-11.22.2023.pdf\">leaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2024/1/10/pr23-03.html\">documents</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/\">that show</a> otherwise. To take just one example, in a <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2024/1/10/pr23-03.html\">brief</a> from the attorney general of Tennessee we learn about a 2019 study Meta commissioned on teenage mental health. The researchers alerted Meta that “[teens] are hooked despite how it makes them feel … Instagram is addictive, and time-spend on the platform is having a negative impact on mental health”. A bit later: “Instagram is the worst platform for mental health.”</p> <p>Turning to his proposals for how to save the internet, Clegg lays out two pillars: “radical transparency” and collaboration. On transparency, he urges tech companies to be more forthcoming about how their algorithms work and how they make their decisions. He warns: “If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to open up, the choice will be taken out of their hands.”</p> <p>On collaboration, he calls for a “digital democracies alliance”, because he is concerned, rightly, that China has developed its technologies in ways that shore up its authoritarian system. He wants the democracies of the world to act together so that the internet might live up to the democracy-promoting visions so many of us shared in the 1990s.</p> <p>Would Clegg’s plan work? Transparency is great in theory, but I fear that it may be too late to apply these principles to the powerful companies that now control much of the internet. As tech journalist Kara Swisher memorably<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/success/boss-files-kara-swisher-tech-accountability\"> said in 2019</a>, Zuckerberg and the other founders “built a city without street signs, without sewage, without police, without garbage men. Imagine that city. It’s not a good city to live in, but they collect all the rent on everything.” This is why scammers, sextortionists, drug dealers and political extremists thrive on these platforms and pose dangers to teens and to democracies that the big companies seem unable to fix. More transparency in 2026 may not be enough to repair the terrible urban design laid down 20 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/14/big-tech-picking-apart-europe-democracy-switch-off-algorithms\">Big tech is picking apart European democracy, but there is a solution: switch off its algorithms | Johnny Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for collaboration, it’s hard to imagine companies like Meta giving up their data or their sovereignty, especially now that the tech moguls have so much support from the Trump administration, and now that the Trump administration is so willing to apply pressure on other countries. If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to collaborate, it’s just not clear to me that “the choice will be taken out of their hands”. By whom?</p> <p>The great biologist and ant expert EO Wilson once said about Marxism: “Good ideology. Wrong species.” After reading this, plus several of the many books about Meta’s unethical, careless, “break things” culture, as well as hundreds of pages from the 2021 document leak known as The Facebook Files and from ongoing lawsuits, I&nbsp;suggest we might say something similar about Clegg’s proposals: “Good plan. Wrong industry.”</p> <p><em>• </em>Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and author of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Anxious Generation (Penguin)<em>. </em>How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict by Nick Clegg is published Bodley Head (£25).

We need to ensure that people crossing the Channel know that it is dangerous, that their lives will not be easy in the UK and that they could be returned under the new agreement.”</p> <p>More than 50,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats since Labour came to power in July 2024, with the vast majority embarking on dangerous crossings from beaches across northern France.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a woman died when the overcrowded dinghy she was in suffered what Kent police described as a “catastrophic deflation” 10 miles off the coast of Dover. The woman was airlifted to shore but pronounced dead, police said.</p> <p>The publicity campaign was drawn up by officials in the Home Office under the last home secretary, Yvette Cooper. It has been endorsed by Shabana Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/07/as-home-secretary-shabana-mahmood-will-face-enormous-challenges\">who was promoted to the role on Friday</a>.

A sign is not going to deter a single person from crossing the Channel in order to be allowed to claim asylum in the UK.</p> <p>“It’s time the government ditched the gimmicks and the so-called deterrents that never work. The only way to end Channel crossings is to create proper, safe routes for people to claim asylum. Presumably the government has already paid for the signage for the beaches, so we could even convert the signs to provide information on how people can apply for those safe routes.”</p> <p>The Home Office is expected to launch the campaign shortly. The department has been asked how much it plans to spend on the campaign, but did not respond before publication.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/10/babies-cries-can-make-humans-physically-hotter-research-finds",
    "description": "<p>When in distress, babies produce chaotic wails which have pronounced effects on humans, including changes in facial temperature</p>",
    "content": "<p>The cry of a distressed baby triggers a rapid emotional response in both men and women that is enough to make them physically hotter, researchers say.</p> <p>Thermal imaging revealed that people experienced a rush of blood to the face that raised the temperature of their skin when they were played recordings of babies wailing.</p> <p>The effect was stronger and more synchronised when babies were more distressed, leading them to produce more chaotic and disharmonious cries. The work suggests that humans respond automatically to specific features in cries that ramp up when babies are in pain.</p> <p>“The emotional response to cries depends on their ‘acoustic roughness’,” said Prof Nicolas Mathevon at the University of Saint-Etienne in France. “We are emotionally sensitive to the acoustic parameters that encode the level of pain in a baby’s cry.”</p> <p>Evolution equipped baby humans with a hard-to-ignore wail to boost their odds of getting the care they need. But not all infant cries are the same. When a baby is in real distress, they forcefully contract their rib cage, producing higher pressure air that causes chaotic vibrations in the vocal cords. This produces “acoustic roughness”, or more technically, disharmonious sounds called nonlinear phenomena (NLP).</p> <p>To see how men and women responded to infants’ cries, scientists played recordings to volunteers with little or no experience with babies. While listening, the participants were filmed with a thermal camera that captured subtle changes in their facial temperature.</p> <p>The adults listened to 16 different cries over four sessions and rated whether the baby was in discomfort or significant pain. The cries were recorded from babies in different levels of distress, ranging from discomfort in the bath to feeling the scratch of a needle at a vaccine clinic.</p> <p>Footage from the thermal camera showed that men and women responded to babies’ cries in much the same way. The wails with the most NLP, regardless of pitch, were rated as coming from babies in real pain and triggered the greatest changes in the adults’ facial temperature.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150\">Journal of The Royal Society Interface</a>, the scientists describe how NLP in babies’ cries produces an automatic response in men and women, suggesting people pick up on the acoustic features to distinguish between babies that are merely unhappy and those in real pain.</p> <p>“The more pain the cries express, the stronger the response of our autonomic nervous system, indicating that we emotionally sense the pain information encoded in the cries,” said Mathevon. “No one had ever measured our response to cries like this before and it is too early to know if there will be practical applications one day.”</p> <p>The study follows <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819066/\">work last month</a> from researchers in Denmark that challenges the claim that women are hardwired to wake up more easily than men when a baby starts crying. It found that men were as likely as women to be woken by wailing infants, despite mothers being three times more likely to get up and tend to the child.</p> <p>The reasons for the disparity are up for debate, but Prof Christine Parsons, who led the team, suggested two potential factors. First, mothers often took maternity leave before fathers took paternity leave and learned how to calm their baby earlier. Second, when mothers were breastfeeding, it might be sensible for fathers to sleep through.</p> <p>“Much of the previous work on adults’ physiological responses to infant crying has looked at heart rate, skin conductance, or even brain responses. So this study is innovating,” Parsons said. “People often assume there will be a clear distinction between men and women in how they respond to crying. The authors set out to test this, and found no evidence for a difference,” she added. “We were also surprised at how little difference there was between men and women.”</p>",

There are growing calls for the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, including the PDCA scheme for former prime ministers, to launch an inquiry.</p> <p>Johnson did not directly respond to questions about the slew of revelations concerning his apparent attempts to monetise his time in Downing Street after stepping down as prime minister in September 2022.</p> <p>They include business ventures in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-nicolas-maduro-meeting-invoice\">Venezuela</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-secretly-lobbied-uae-business-venture-leak-suggests\">UAE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-sought-business-with-saudi-officials-better-earth\">Saudi Arabia</a> involving individuals he met while prime minister.</p> <p>In his first comments since the Guardian revealed details of the leak, Johnson denied suggestions he was misusing public funds. “This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Guardian revealed further details about the operations of Johnson’s private office. They suggest the former Conservative leader:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-secretly-lobbied-uae-business-venture-leak-suggests\">Secretly lobbied the UAE for a billion-dollar private venture in a potential breach of ethics rules</a>. His work as a “principal adviser” for Bia Advisory, a “climate finance solutions” firm seeking backing from Abu Dhabi’s $300bn investment fund, involved courting a top Emirati official Johnson hosted in No 10 when he was prime minister.</p></li> <li><p>Approached Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-elon-musk-evening-standard-evgeny-lebedev\">on behalf of Evgeny Lebedev</a>. The Evening Standard owner, whom Johnson made a peer, was seeking a business relationship between his newspaper and Musk, who bankrolled Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House.</p></li> <li><p>Secured contracts with a combined total of more than £850,000 in separate deals with GB News and Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail. GB News suggested some of the information was incorrect but confirmed an ongoing arrangement with Johnson.</p></li> <li><p>Earned more than £5m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-paid-speeches-putin-queen-birthday-bash\">from less than two years of paid speeches</a>, for some of which he charged $350,000 (£259,000). The 34 speeches include a conference leadership in Delhi, a blockchain symposium in Singapore and a bizarre turn as the headline act at the 50th birthday party of a German pharmaceuticals company boss.</p></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The speeches, like much of the material in the leak, raise questions for Johnson about the manner in which he has been trading on his time in No 10 for private gain, in a possible conflict of interest.</p> <p>He was paid $250,000 (£185,000) to give a speech in California in May 2024 to an American private equity firm, Clearlake Capital. Two years earlier, in May 2022, Johnson’s government had authorised the £2.5bn sale of Chelsea Football Club to, among others, Clearlake. (A source at the company said the two events were entirely unconnected.)</p> <p>There are also questions over whether, in return for cash, he is divulging views or information former prime ministers typically keep to themselves.</p> <p>Johnson’s audiences have been treated to his views on Barack Obama (“the most inert, invertebrate president we’ve had for a long, long time”) and Vladimir Putin (“like the fat boy in Dickens, he wants to make your flesh creep”), as well as private anecdotes about the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen\">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, including a time he said she advised him to talk to birds.</p> <p>The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which monitors the activities of former ministers and senior civil servants, said it would look into Johnson’s newly revealed contacts and income since leaving office.</p> <p>A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.</p> <p>However, the Liberal Democrats have called on the NAO to launch a formal investigation into potential misuse of public funds. The NAO has the power to examine the paperwork that is submitted by former prime ministers to claim their allowance.</p> <p>Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of public standards, said Johnson had questions to answer over the revelations. Speaking to the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast, Thomas-Symonds said: “Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer about his conduct in Covid. And on previous evidence, his behaviour since leaving office has been a disgrace.”</p> <p>The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, defended Johnson’s right to undertake lucrative work after he had left office. “I think that people should be able to earn money when they leave politics,” she told GB News.</p>",
