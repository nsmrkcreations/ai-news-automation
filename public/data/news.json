    "content": "<p>A man allegedly captured on video at the far-right rally in London on Saturday threatening to kill Keir Starmer has been arrested by police.</p> <p>An investigation was launched on Sunday in connection with the video, which was filmed at the event organised by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>The footage included an interview with a man who said that “Keir Starmer needs to be assassinated” and “someone needs to shoot Keir Starmer”. Metropolitan police had said it was aware of the video, which was circulating on social media, and was attempting to identify the man.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Met said: “A man has been arrested in relation to a video referencing Sir Keir Starmer which was filmed during the ‘unite the kingdom’ protest on Saturday 13 September in central London.</p> <p>“On Sunday 14 September police arrested a 56-year-old man on suspicion of malicious communications. He was taken into custody and later released on bail pending further inquiries.”</p> <p>Scotland Yard estimated that at least 110,000 people attended the event. A total of 26 police officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled, and the Met said on Sunday that 24 people had been arrested for a range of alleged offences including common assault and violent disorder.</p> <p>The force said a post-event investigation was under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.</p> <p>Speakers included the owner of Tesla and X, Elon Musk, who was condemned by Downing Street for using “dangerous and inflammatory” language at the event. The billionaire, who appeared via a live link, told a crowd of protesters that “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.</p> <p>Marchers had travelled to London by train and coach for a demonstration, which was billed as a “festival of free speech”, but by its conclusion had amplified racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim hate speech across Whitehall.</p> <p>The scale of the protest vastly outgrew police estimates, resulting in tense and at times violent clashes between protesters and police.</p>",

Many held placards expressing anger and frustration with a wide range of political issues, from climate breakdown and abortion rights to genocide in Gaza, nuclear disarmament, the monarchy, the rise of Reform and racism. Common placards displayed slogans stating “make polluters pay”, “no to racism, no to Trump”, “stop arming Israel” and “stop Trump, stop fascism”.</p> \n  <p>Other protesters adopted creative approaches, including one woman who dressed as the statue of Liberty, holding a book stating “the statue of taking Liberties”, another who dragged a Trump effigy on the ground, and one person dressed in a costume echoing the inflatable Trump baby blimp from the 2018 protest, clutching a list titled the “Epstein Files”, listing the people allegedly implicated.</p> \n  <p>Protesters who spoke to the Guardian said they were participating to signal their exasperation with Keir Starmer and the UK government, as well as their rage about Donald Trump’s prominence on the world stage, and the impact of his divisive policies.</p> \n  <p>One art teacher from south London had hand-painted a placard featuring portraits of Starmer and Trump stating “appeasing hate empowers fascists”. She said she wanted to send a message to Starmer that she was disappointed in the Labour government, and that his decision to invite Trump for a second state visit was “appalling”.</p> \n  <p>She was inspired by her South African father to join the protest, given the eventual impact that civil disobedience had on ending apartheid. She told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Whatever the general public can do, even if it means going on a protest and just marching and raising your voice – however small it is, it’s better than nothing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Chloe Evans</strong> had travelled up from Dorset to express her fears around the rollback she felt the Trump administration was having on women’s rights, including abortion and rape prosecution.

And we’re doing our best to pressure our government to take action.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sam Weinstein</strong>, an American who has lived in London since 2012, joined the protest to represent the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I’m outraged that they would even consider inviting Trump to this country. Since when do we elect convicted criminals, and since when do we let them govern the world?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>John</strong>, who grew up in the southern states of the US, said he had seen the rise of the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement up close, and feared that we are now “watching the rise of fascism”, with the lessons of the previous century increasingly forgotten. He travelled up from Bournemouth to hold a placard that said he had been “radicalised” by Trump, because he had never before felt so motivated to participate in politics.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T18:10:15.166Z\">at 7.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68cac7158f085b3ecec0276f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T14:44:46.059Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thousands of anti-Trump protesters march in London</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>But in London the anti-Trump protesters are out in their thousands.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T14:48:23.127Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68cac8218f08b62a47554c44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-17T14:39:57.382Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Windsor a small number of protesters outside the castle are outnumbered by throngs of the world’s media and a large police presence, PA Media reports.

He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand the UK government’s position of being pragmatic on the international stage and wanting to maintain a good relationship with the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Faced with a revanchist Russia, Europe’s security feels less certain now than at any time since the second world war. And the threat of even higher US tariffs is ever present.</p> \n   <p>But it’s also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart.

Official Britain is laying out the red carpet for Donald Trump today. It is the first full day of his unprecedented state visit, and he will spend it with King Charles at Windsor Castle enjoying the finest pageantry the nation can lay on. Keir Starmer, like other Western leaders, has concluded that the key to getting positive outcomes from Trump is flattery and shameless sucking up, and (not for the first time) the royal family is being deployed to this end.</p> \n  <p>But civic Britain will also have its say on Trump today, and – perhaps mindful of his obsession with big crowds and his (supposed) love for free speech – there will be <a href=\"https://stoptrump.org.uk/local-protests/\">protests all over the country</a>, with the main one in London. When Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president in the Trump’s first administration, was asked he felt about being booed one night when he attended the theatre, he said that was “the sound of freedom”. Trump’s response to protesters is much darker. But there is almost no chance of his hearing “the sound of freedom” today; his state visit is taking place entirely behind closed doors.</p> \n  <p>I will be focusing largely on the state visit today, but I will be covering non-Trump UK politics too.</p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight story about Trump arriving in the UK.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">Donald Trump lands in UK for second state visit as protesters gather in Windsor</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Here is <strong>Rafael Behr</strong>’s Guardian about the potential flaws in Starmer’s obsequious approach to handling the US president.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-america-donald-trump-britain\">Keir Starmer is betting everything on an America that doesn’t exist any more | Rafael Behr</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here is an Rafael’s conclusion.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master. Fealty to the super-potentate across the Atlantic is an all-in gamble. There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p> \n   <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate? What is the probability of an orderly transfer of power away from a ruling party that unites religious fundamentalists, white supremacists, wild-eyed tech-utopian oligarchs and opportunist kleptocrats who cast all opposition in shades of treason?</p> \n   <p>These are not people who humbly surrender power at the ballot box, or even run the risk of fair elections. They are not people on whose values and judgment Britain should be betting its future prosperity or national security.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the timetable for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>11.55am:</em> Donald Trump arrives at Windsor Castle by helicopter.

Plus the Spaniards have five first-team players missing through injury, three ruled out by problems picked up in Saturday’s 2-0 home win against Villarreal.

The results follow the death of Diogo Jota and more than £400m of signings designed to make the squad more suited to Slot’s vision. “I think we are far above my expectations from during this summer,” Slot said.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/16/liverpool-arne-slot-atletico-madrid-champions-league-preview\">Perfect Liverpool exceed Slot’s hopes as Atlético arrive on Champions League duty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

    "content": "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/plan-slash-us-steel-tariffs-shelved-ahead-donald-trump-visit\">multibillion-dollar transatlantic tech agreement</a> announced to coincide with Donald Trump’s state visit represents “sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”, Nick Clegg, Meta’s former president of global affairs, has said.</p> <p>The former deputy prime minister said the deals, heralded with great fanfare by the government as it tries to foster growth in the UK, were “mutton dressed as lamb” and would make the country ever more reliant on US tech firms.</p> <p>The announcements have included some of the biggest companies in the tech world, such as chipmaker Nvidia and the ChatGPT developer OpenAI. One announcement featured a Microsoft investment that was said to be worth $30bn (£22bn).</p> <p>However, speaking at a Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said the relationship between the UK and the US tech sector was “all one-way traffic” and that the announcements suited the companies.</p> <p>He warned Britain was being “defanged” by simply fostering a greater reliance on the US tech sector, rather than building its own.</p> <p>“These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway,” he said. “They’re building datacentres all over the world. Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.</p> <p>“We’re a kind of vassal state technologically, we really are. The moment our companies, our tech companies, start developing any scale or ambition, they have to go to California, because we don’t have the growth capital here.”</p> <p>He also revealed former US ambassador Peter Mandelson had asked for his advice on the tech sector before the Trump visit. Clegg said he advised the peer to be cautious about US-UK tech tie-ups.</p> <p>“In a sense, this US-UK tech deal is just another version of the United Kingdom holding on to Uncle Sam’s coat-tails,” he said.</p> <p>“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal – which is basically just taking sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”</p> <p>His intervention will frustrate ministers, as attracting investment from big tech has formed a major part of their search for growth. The deals have been used as an example of Britain’s success in building a close US relationship.</p>    <p>It came after Jensen Huang, the co-founder and chief executive of the US AI chipmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nvidia\">Nvidia</a>, predicted “the UK is going to be an AI superpower” as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/jensen-huang-nvidia-uk-ai-superpower-500m-nscale\">announced a new £500m investment in a British firm</a>.</p> <p>Huang, who was due to join Donald Trump at Wednesday night’s state banquet with the king, said he was taking an equity stake in Nscale, a UK cloud computing company, and predicted it would earn revenues of up to £50bn over the next six years.</p> <p>“We’re here to announce that the UK is going to be an AI superpower,” he told a press conference in London.</p> <p>Huang cited as evidence of Britain’s potential its universities and several companies founded in the UK, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster\">the AI giant DeepMind</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/07/uk-ai-startup-wayve-funding-self-driving-softbank\">driverless car startup Wayve</a>.</p> <p>“You just don’t appreciate it.

    "description": "<p>A growing number of shooters are in conversation with their digital communities, which are becoming extreme</p>",
    "content": "<p>On the day that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson shot and killed rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, prosecutors say, he texted his roommate to confess what he’d done. While appearing to admit to the murder and describe how he was planning to retrieve his gun, he pivoted to mention why he had carved messages into the ammunition.</p> <p>“Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme,” Robinson texted, according to authorities.</p> <p>Robinson’s shooting of Kirk has put the spotlight on the intersection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence\">political violence</a> and an increasingly nihilistic<strong> </strong>online world that promotes misinformation and extremism. It’s a confluence that raises fundamental questions about how internet culture influences both extremist attacks and how we understand them, at a time when some of the biggest online spaces are increasingly more divisive and less moderated.</p> <p>Robinson appeared to spend much of his life on the internet and playing video games, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/technology/charlie-kirk-meta-x-tiktok.html\">friends describing him</a> as “terminally online”. He was active on Discord, a messaging platform popular among the gaming community, and as a teenager dressed up as internet memes for Halloween.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/15/charlie-kirk-shooting-memes-internet-culture\">How memes, gaming and internet culture all relate to the Charlie Kirk shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bullet casings from the gun he allegedly fired<strong> </strong>were engraved with niche references and internet-speak – “notices bulge OwO what’s this”, a reference to a meme about sex within the online Furry subculture, “if you read this you are gay LMAO”, “Hey Fascist! CATCH!”, as well as the controller movements to use a special bomb in the popular video game Helldivers 2 and the lyrics to the antifascist song Bella Ciao, which has become popular among gamers after featuring in the game Far Cry 6.</p> <p>In Robinson’s exchanges with his roommate, who he was also romantically involved with, he appeared to have been thinking of how the ironic messages would be received.</p> <p>“If I see ‘uwu notices bulge’ on fox new [sic] I might have a stroke,” Robinson texted.</p> <p>With the references, Robinson fits a modern trend of attackers leaving behind messages that not only show they are products of an online culture, but are in conversation with it. In recent years, a growing number of shooters have left behind writings, whether full manifestos or single sentence posts online, that contain nihilistic in-jokes and references that aim to differentiate their extremely online cohort from the “normies” who will struggle to understand them.</p> <p>The manifesto left behind by the neo-Nazi who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 contained both extreme white nationalist ideology and <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2019/03/15/shitposting-inspirational-terrorism-and-the-christchurch-mosque-massacre/\">“shitpost”-style ironic references</a> to video games and podcasters<strong>. </strong>The man who opened fire at a supermarket in El Paso, Texas, that same year <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/08/04/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-gamification-of-terror/\">announced his killings on the message board 8chan</a>, prompting users to create memes and encourage others to try to “beat their high scores” in body count.</p> <p>Extremist mass killings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/4chan-radicalize-buffalo-shooting-white-supremacy\">at a supermarket in a predominately Black area of Buffalo, New York</a>, in 2022 and at a <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/04/28/ignore-the-poway-synagogue-shooters-manifesto-pay-attention-to-8chans-pol-board/\">synagogue in Poway, California</a>, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/international-teenage-neo-nazi-network-feuerkrieg-totenwaffen-accelerationism-2022-7\">multi-newsroom investigation in 2022</a> that pored over tens of thousands of messages from an international neo-Nazi extremist network found that the chats were inflected with memes and gaming slang as they planned to commit violence.</p> <p>In addition to speaking to their online communities, attackers are also often in dialogue with each other, whether in some far-right circles where extremists celebrate individuals as “saints” with their own memorialized days or simply through copying elements of previous killings. As <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-assassination-online-reaction/684201/\">others have noted</a>, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/minneapolis-church-shooting-influencers/684083/\">attacked</a> a Minneapolis Catholic school. It also echoes the engravings that United Healthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione allegedly left on his bullets, which became a meme to the point it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDfpMyKzMY8/?hl=en\">featured on shirts</a> from a popular alt-fashion label.</p> <p>Robinson’s engravings themselves don’t offer a cohesive explanation for Kirk’s killing. Prosecutors say Robinson told his roommate he shot Kirk because the conservative activist was spreading hatred. They also allege that his mother told investigators that her son had spent the previous year or so becoming “more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented”.</p> <p>But much about Robinson’s path to radicalization is still unclear. There is an enormous gulf between holding opposition to Kirk’s views and carrying out a targeted killing. And increasingly, experts say, the motivation of shooters, particularly young ones, don’t fit neatly into a traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-roommate\">left-right spectrum</a> but are shaped by the fractured, heavily online state of modern politics. Ignoring the messier nature of radicalization in lieu of fitting attackers into convenient boxes risks missing what actually drives people to commit acts of extremist violence.</p> <h2><strong>The radicalization of being online</strong></h2> <p>Instead of trying to find precise meaning in the irony soaked, trolling messages that attackers have left behind, extremism researchers argue that it’s often more useful to look at how online mediums are broadly shaping radicalization. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers.</p> <p>Although technological influences are only one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence\">part of rising political violence</a> – along with mental health issues, political polarization and the widespread availability of firearms in the US – extremism researchers are increasingly studying the evolving ways that social media platforms and online spaces can radicalize and isolate users.</p> <p>In a 2023 paper for George Washington University’s Project on Extremism, Jacob Ware, a <a href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2023-06/third-generation-final.pdf\">researcher described what he called</a> a “third generation of online radicalization” that emerged in the late 2010s. Some of its characteristics include how meme culture helps radicalize and normalize attacks, as well as how precise ideology or affiliation with an organization becomes less important than lone acts of violence. The online culture around violence and extremism ends up blurring traditional lines of terrorism, Ware argues, as well as encourages making performative content to go along with attacks.</p> <p>“Global grievances are acted upon with great fury in very local contexts – and yet, the main audience is often online,” Ware writes.</p> <p>The growth of social media and erosion of previous gatekeepers have also left it unclear how to counter the spread of online radicalization, especially given social media platforms’ shift <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/technology/charlie-kirk-meta-x-tiktok.html\">towards shirking responsibility</a> for hosting violent and extreme content. What was once the generally accepted policy among media outlets and platforms to not share attackers’ manifestos, part of a public health argument from researchers to avoid copycats, has degraded as social media has given way to amateur sleuths posting every element of someone’s digital footprint for clues. And as messages and memes from attackers spread more easily, they also in turn generate more posts riffing on the violence and turning it into content. It is a particularly dark function of an industry that has built its growth through algorithmically pushing politically divisive and extremist content.</p> <p>The result is that while online culture has enmeshed itself into extremism and political violence, previously secluded parts of the extremist internet culture have increasingly infected the everyday internet. The use of ironic humour connected to violence and extremism is not unique to the digital age – <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4464823\">an essay from 1944</a> once discussed how antisemites amused themselves with flippant hateful statements – but it has become an incredibly pervasive part of the online experience. Ideologies and memes that would have once been relegated to obscure comment boards and extremist websites are now essentially the native tongue of the internet and distributed through mainstream social media platforms.</p> <p>Kirk himself was a product of this online world, best known for viral clips of his combative, debate-style exchanges that social media users across the political spectrum shared to either champion or mock him.</p> <p>Videos of Kirk’s killing have since fed into the same online spaces and content machine where he was once ubiquitous, sometimes autoplaying on X without warning viewers. Reactions to his death have become part of the same content mill, with video essays claiming to explain the killing and AI-generated tributes depicting him in heaven proliferating online. An aspiring influencer who was attending the event where Kirk was shot even attempted to immediately farm the killing for content, posting a video of himself promoting his social media channels during the chaos.</p> <p>“Make sure you subscribe!” the TikToker, who later deleted the video, said while flashing a peace sign as attendees around him screamed and fled.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">arrival in the UK on Tuesday night</a> was accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/plan-slash-us-steel-tariffs-shelved-ahead-donald-trump-visit\">multibillion-dollar transatlantic tech agreement</a>.</p> <p>The announcement features some of the biggest names from Silicon Valley: the chipmaker Nvidia; the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI; and Microsoft. Big numbers were involved, with Microsoft hailing its $30bn (£22bn) investment as a major commitment to the UK – and adding, in an apparent swipe at its rivals, that it was not making “empty tech promises”.</p> <p>Here is a breakdown of the announcements in the UK-US “tech prosperity deal”, spelling out what is explicitly new in them.</p>  <h2>Microsoft invests $30bn in UK </h2>  <p>Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, hailed the “single biggest announcement” in the pact and insisted it was not an empty promise. The $30bn (£22bn) sets out the company’s UK budget over the next four years and refers not just to artificial intelligence infrastructure but also “ongoing operations” across the UK. </p> <p>Microsoft said the number included $15bn in capital expenditure – such as on equipment, land and buildings – for AI and cloud services, areas where datacentres are key components. The other half will go on day-to-day operations such as research, sales and product development.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/16/top-uk-artists-urge-starmer-to-protect-their-work-on-eve-of-trump-visit\">Top UK artists urge Starmer to protect their work on eve of Trump visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of the package, the US company said it would back an already announced project, an AI datacentre in Loughton, Essex, by becoming a core customer of its owner, the UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale.</p> <p>Smith had criticised the UK in 2023 as being “bad for business” after Microsoft’s takeover of the video games maker Activision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/26/microsoft-bid-for-activision-blizzard-blocked-by-uk-competition-regulator\">was blocked</a> – a move that was later unwound. He told reporters on Tuesday that Microsoft had been “encouraged” by steps taken by the governments of Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, with the latter helping on planning permission and energy access.</p> <p>“We have a more stable opportunity to accelerate investment in the UK,” Smith said.</p> <p>The £22bn is a significant chunk of the £31bn value the UK government placed on the pact, which also includes £5bn of expenditure from Google that the search company described as “additional investment over the next two years”. The Google figure includes capital expenditure, research and development, and related engineering, as well as work at the AI unit Google DeepMind.</p> <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England </h2>  <p>The north-east will host an AI “growth zone”, an area that will receive special support in planning permission and energy provision for hosting AI infrastructure such as datacentres. The government said this could unlock more than 5,000 jobs and bring in £30bn in investment, although this is all hypothetical for now. </p> <p>One of the datacentre sites, Blyth in Northumberland, has already been announced and is receiving £10bn in financial commitment from the US investment firm Blackstone. </p> <p>The other site mentioned, at Cobalt Park in North Tyneside, features a new development: a domestic version of the US “Stargate” datacentre project championed by Trump. Nscale, OpenAI and Nvidia will develop a platform that will deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK. The idea is that Stargate UK will help develop “sovereign” AI, where cutting-edge technology is developed and used in the UK’s interests. </p> <p>As part of the first phase of Stargate UK, OpenAI will use 8,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the powerful computer chips that underpin AI tools such as ChatGPT. Cobalt Park will be one of several UK sites under the plan. </p> <h2>Nvidia’s £11bn announcement </h2>  <p>Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker, touted an £11bn injection into the UK economy as part of the pact, providing up to 120,000 of its powerful Blackwell GPUs to projects that will be built over the next couple of years in the UK. So, there is a degree of overlap with other announcements in the pact.</p> <p>Clarifying its investment on Wednesday, Nvidia said the £11bn referred to the total “end-to-end value” its partners were delivering, encompassing the chips they have bought from Nvidia, land and buildings involved in constructing the datacentres, and supercomputers that will house the GPUs. Nvidia, at $4tn the biggest company in the world’s biggest economy, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/jensen-huang-nvidia-uk-ai-superpower-500m-nscale\">also investing £500m in Nscale</a>.</p> <h2>Other announcements </h2>  <p>CoreWeave, a US datacentre company, said it would invest a further £1.5bn in the UK including a site in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The US software company Salesforce is investing an additional $2bn in the UK, adding two years to a financial commitment to the UK that will now run to 2030. Nvidia will also invest an undisclosed amount in the UK’s AI startup scene. </p> <h2>Tech-boss influx </h2>  <p>The pact, and Trump’s visit, is being accompanied by an entourage of US tech bosses, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI travelling across the Atlantic to symbolically reinforce their ties to the US president. Since Trump has been in power, US tech leaders have lined up to express loyalty and support for him and this is another opportunity to do so – as well as to support the projection of US leadership in AI. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is also reportedly attending Wednesday’s state banquet. </p> <h2>AI and energy </h2>  <p>The government claims that the US-UK agreement will “turbocharge” the UK’s low-carbon economy by encouraging the build-out of new nuclear power stations to power the datacentres and supercomputers that underpin the technology.</p> <p>Specifically, the tech pact is expected to bring forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">multibillion-pound investments in new nuclear technologies,</a> which would create thousands of jobs under a string of separate transatlantic agreements revealed earlier this week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/16/google-ai-investment-uk-trump-visit-rachel-reeves\">Google announces £5bn AI investment in UK before Trump visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These new pledges build on Starmer’s existing plan for a once-in-a-generation nuclear expansion that he revealed earlier this year alongside an open invitation to tech companies such as Google, Meta and Amazon to invest in AI datacentres in Britain, which could be powered by small modular reactors.</p> <p>Growing the UK’s low-carbon energy supplies is considered essential if it hopes to host the energy-hungry datacentres required for an AI industry while staying within its net zero carbon budgets. But it will need to add enough new low-carbon energy generation to match the needs of the datacentres, as well as the growing demand for electricity from the rest of the economy, if it hopes to avoid adding extra gas power to the energy system in the future. </p> <p>Many global tech companies, which are also under pressure to satisfy their own carbon-cutting commitments, are turning to nuclear power because reactors generate electricity at a steady rate, which mirrors the energy use of a datacentre. This summer, Meta signed a 20-year deal with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/03/meta-nuclear-power-ai\">nuclear power station</a> in Illinois, while Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy in the race for AI dominance.</p> <p>Still, the latest AI plans are likely to raise further questions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/17/ai-boom-environment-agency-cannot-predict-future-water-shortages-england-data-centres\">over the UK’s under-pressure water supplies</a> – which are needed to cool down some energy-intensive datacentres. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Third option for juries – blamed for country’s lower conviction rates for rape and sexual assault – abolished</p>",
    "content": "<p>The Scottish verdict of “not proven” – a global legal anomaly thought to be a key factor in the country’s significantly lower convictions rate for rape and sexual assault – has been abolished.</p> <p>MSPs agreed to scrap the unique Scottish verdict as they voted through a series of major changes that Angela Constance, the justice secretary, said “put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system”.</p> <p>The abolition of not proven – a third option for juries that dated back to the 18th century and which acquitted an accused person but stopped short of finding them not guilty – was welcomed by the campaigner known only as Miss M as “giving survivors and their families back their voice”.</p> <p>Miss M launched her campaign against the verdict in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/nov/13/call-for-abolition-of-not-proven-verdict-in-scottish-law\">the Guardian in 2018</a> after winning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/05/scottish-civil-court-rules-that-acquitted-man-did-student\">landmark civil action</a> when the criminal case against the man she accused of raping her on a university freshers’ week night out was found not proven.</p> <p>She said: “We have all spoken up about how damaging this verdict is. Today we have been listened to and the improvements to the legal system are going to make it fairer and clearer going forward.”</p> <p>In 2022-23, the not proven verdict made up 61% of rape and attempted rape acquittals, compared with an overall rate of 22% for all criminal offences. She added: “To know that another rape victim isn’t going to experience what I had to go through after my criminal trial ended is the very reason I’ve invested so much time and energy into this campaign.”</p> <p>The final vote on the Scottish government’s <a href=\"https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/s6/victims-witnesses-and-justice-reform-scotland-bill\">victims, witnesses and justice reform bill</a> passed by 71 votes to 46 after a lengthy debate considering more than 160 amendments.</p> <p>Constance told MSPs on Wednesday afternoon it was “time to come together” to support the bill, which also changes the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction, establishes a specialist sexual offences court, and enshrines in Scots law the right to lifelong anonymity for rape complainers (the Scottish legal term for complainants).</p> <p>She said: “By changing culture, process and practice across the system, it will help to ensure victims are heard, supported, protected and treated with compassion, while the rights of the accused will continue to be safeguarded.”</p> <p>The bill will also establish a victims and witnesses commissioner and provide an automatic right to publicly funded, independent legal representation for complainers to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history.</p> <p>But Liam Kerr, the shadow justice secretary, told the Holyrood chamber the bill “misses so many chances to do better”. He said the Scottish Conservatives voted against the “half-baked” final bill after their amendment to establish an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland fell, as did their “no body, no release” proposal to require the parole board to consider whether killers have provided information on the whereabouts of their victims’ remains.</p> <p>The chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, commended the “many positive steps” in the new law but reiterated “serious concerns” about the increase to the jury majority. “Research shows a reluctance to convict rape cases and deep-rooted prejudices around sexual violence affect public attitudes and jury decision-making every day. An increased jury majority will undoubtedly make survivors’ fight for justice even harder.”</p> <p>The<strong> </strong>Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland have also cautioned that the increase from a simple majority to two-thirds, and how that would act in conjunction with the abolition of not proven, could “cheapen the guilty verdict”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Delphi-2M uses diagnoses, ‘medical events’ and lifestyle factors to create forecasts for next decade and beyond</p>",
    "content": "<p>Scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence tool that can predict your personal risk of more than 1,000 diseases, and forecast changes in health a decade in advance.</p> <p>The generative AI tool was custom-built by experts from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer Research Centre and the University of Copenhagen, using algorithmic concepts similar to those used in large language models (LLMs).</p> <p>It is one of the most comprehensive demonstrations to date of how generative AI can model human disease progression at scale, and was trained on data from two entirely separate healthcare systems.</p> <p>Details of the breakthrough were <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09529-3\">published in the journal Nature</a>.</p> <p>“Medical events often follow predictable patterns,” said Tomas Fitzgerald, a staff scientist at EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). “Our AI model learns those patterns and can forecast future health outcomes.”</p> <p>The tool works by assessing the probability of whether – and when – someone may develop diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease and many other disorders.</p> <p>Named Delphi-2M, it looks for “medical events” in a patient’s history, such as when illnesses were diagnosed, together with lifestyle factors such as whether they are or were obese, smoked or drank alcohol, plus their age and sex.</p> <p>The tool also looks at anonymised patient record data to predict what might happen over the next decade and beyond.</p> <p>The tool was trained and tested on anonymised patient data from 400,000 people in the UK Biobank study and 1.9 million patients in the Danish national patient registry.</p> <p>Health risks are expressed as rates over time, similar to forecasting a 70% chance of rain at the weekend.</p> <p>Ewan Birney, the EMBL interim executive director, said patients might be able to benefit from the tool within the next few years.</p> <p>“You walk into the doctor’s surgery and the clinician is very used to using these tools, and they are able to say: ‘Here’s four major risks that are in your future and here’s two things you could do to really change that.’</p> <p>“I suspect everyone will be told to lose weight, and if you smoke you will be told to stop smoking – and that will be in your data so that advice isn’t going to change remarkably – but for some diseases I think there will be some very specific things. That’s the future we want to create.”</p> <p>He said the advantage of the new AI tool over existing ones – such as the Qrisk method of calculating risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade – was “we can do all diseases at once and over a long time period. That is the thing that single disease models can’t do.”</p> <p>The team said: “Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models.</p> <p>“Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years.”</p> <p>Prof Moritz Gerstung, the head of the division of AI in oncology at the German Cancer Research Centre, said: “This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression.</p> <p>“Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.”</p>",

Another rollicking opening stand with Jos Buttler – they amassed 74 inside five overs – made the remainder comfortable, a spurt of late wickets causing little bother.</p> <p>“Coming off at half-time it certainly wasn’t an easy target to chase,” said Salt. “[There was] a little bit there for guys taking pace off the ball, a little bit two-paced when they went hard into the wicket.” But he made it look a stroll, helping Bethell to a bit more history: this was England’s first win against Ireland in a men’s T20.</p> <p>Malahide was a lovely, leafy sight in the early afternoon, overnight rain making way for a poking sun. This was much needed for Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">short on fixtures at home</a> because of a tight budget and with a three-match series against West Indies in June – their last assignment – including two washouts.</p> <p>Paul Stirling was grateful for the autumnal opportunity, putting on 57 for the first wicket alongside Ross Adair, no early release provided to Bethell. The hosts, up against the veteran pair of Liam Dawson and Adil Rashid, were keen to crush spin. Adair and Stirling found midwicket and long-on respectively as they tried to launch the tweakers, but Tucker and Tector remained on the hunt.</p>    <p>Tucker contributed a crucial 34 at No 3 in the previous T20 meeting between these two sides, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/ireland-stun-england-at-t20-world-cup-to-throw-super-12s-wide-open\">memorable Irish victory</a> at the 2022 World Cup. Tector had the experience of being out in the middle five years ago, in his first one-day international series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/04/england-ireland-odi-match-report\">when Ireland beat England</a> in a pandemic bout at Southampton. The two twentysomethings had no reason to be fazed.</p> <p>Tector pumped Rashid over the leg side, the fourth six conceded by the leg-spinner, and reached his half-century off 31 balls. There was further joy at the death; Ireland hit 45 off the last three overs, George Dockrell’s only-ball six providing the perfect finish.</p> <p>Still, Salt and Buttler were fresh from their pyro party last week, when they put up 126 inside eight overs. They immediately threatened to match that effort, taking just three overs to bring up 50; Buttler took 22 off one Graham Hume set, turning the 34-year-old’s medium pace into throwdowns.</p> <p>Matthew Humphreys’ left-arm spin forced a miscue from Buttler on 28 to bring in Bethell. Any nerves were understandable as the left-hander searched for the middle, his first 12 balls returning just 10. Salt appeared out to Tector’s part-time spin on 51 after finding a fielder, but a no-ball call kept the right-hander’s cruelty coming.</p> <p>Bethell finally clicked with a series of boundaries off Tector, but fell in the same over with a chip to cover for 24. Rehan Ahmed emerged for his first England appearance of the year, granted an opportunity at No 4, but was a touch too eager when he charged Gareth Delany and was bowled for eight.</p> <p>Salt fell short of a fifth T20 international hundred – he would have joined Glenn Maxwell and Rohit Sharma at the top of the list – finding deep point off the expensive Hume at the end of the 16th over. But England, with 16 runs required, were in no position to fall from there.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Someone have a word with the chimps? Observations of the apes in the wild show them imbibing the alcoholic equivalent of a half pint of beer a day through the vast amount of fermented fruit in their diet.</p> <p>Researchers arrived at the first estimates of wild chimp daily alcohol intake after measuring ethanol levels in fallen fruit that the apes gather from the forest floor in Kibale national park in Uganda and in Taï national park in Ivory Coast.</p> <p>While individual fruits contained less than 0.5% alcohol, the chimps’ daily intake swelled as they devoured the ripe fruit pulp. The apes were particularly fond of figs, which contained some of the highest levels of alcohol the team recorded.</p> <p>Aleksey Maro, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said at both African sites, males and females consumed about 14g of pure ethanol per day through fermented fruit. That is equivalent to one standard US drink or half a pint of 5% ABV lager.</p> <p>“The chimps are eating 5 to 10% of their body weight a day in ripe fruit, so even low concentrations yield a high daily total, a substantial dosage of alcohol,” said Prof Robert Dudley, also at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>Dudley believes the chimps’ consumption of alcohol in the wild supports his “<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2419\">drunken monkey</a>” hypothesis, which posits that the human penchant for drink has roots in our primate ancestors’ need for energy-rich, ripe, fermented fruit.

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/30/alcohol-consumption-abundant-in-the-natural-world-study-finds\">review of evidence</a> published last year found alcohol consumption to be commonplace in the animal kingdom.

    "description": "<p>Met chief Mark Rowley says many questions remain and detectives are liaising with German and Portuguese police</p>",
    "content": "<p>Mark Rowley has said the British police investigation into Madeleine McCann will explore extraditing the German national Christian Brückner to the UK to stand trial over the three-year-old’s disappearance.</p> <p>Brückner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/madeleine-mccann-case-suspect-christian-bruckner-germany-prison-release\">was released from a German prison</a> on Wednesday after serving a seven-year jail term for the rape of an elderly woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2005, two years before Madeleine disappeared while on holiday with her family in the same town.</p> <p>British police have been formally involved since 2011 in supporting Portuguese and German efforts to solve the mystery of her disappearance.</p> <p>British police regard Brückner, 49, as their main suspect, as do their European counter parts. He was released from jail after an investigation did not produce enough evidence to support a charge over Madeleine’s disappearance under German law.</p> <p>Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said: “They’ve got to a particular point in their inquiry where the prosecutor doesn’t feel they’re able to prosecute. We’re now at a stage where he remains a suspect for us. We’re taking stock.</p> <p>“The Germans have done everything they possibly can do within their law. He has a track record for very serious offences. He remains a suspect in our investigation into Madeleine McCann being missing.”</p> <p>Asked if Brückner could be extradited to face trial in the UK, Rowley pointed out that an offence as serious as murder need not be tried in the country where the crime took place.</p> <p>Rowley, who is Britain’s most senior police officer, said: “There are hundreds of questions. One of the reasons we are involved is that murder is in many situations extraterritorial and potentially a murder of a British subject can in certain circumstances be charged in the UK.</p> <p>“There’s lots of maybes, so at the moment we are taking stock with the Germans and Portuguese.”</p> <p>Brückner denies any blame for the disappearance of Madeleine, whose family are from Leicestershire. It emerged earlier this week that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/prime-madeleine-mccann-suspect-refuses-met-interview-before-german-prison-release\">refused a request from the Met</a> to interview him over the case. </p> <p>The Met say they will continue to pursue any viable lines of enquiry and that their investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>The former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, Nick Vamos, said: “Yes, it is feasible. The main obstacle is you need enough evidence to charge before you can extradite.”</p> <p>Rowley oversaw British police efforts to resolve the case of Madeleine’s disappearance early in his career at the Met. He said a previous appeal involving British police had led to Brückner being identified as a suspect, which led to German police joining the investigation.</p> <p>Privately the Met knows bringing Brückner before a British court would be unprecedented and difficult. </p> <p>Rowley spoke to reporters to mark his third anniversary as commissioner. He said under his tenure the Met had carried out the biggest ever purge of corrupt and failing officers and staff in British policing history, ousting 1,400 people.</p> <p>He said corrupt cliques still existed and more attention would turn to them as the legacy of bad officers was cleared out.</p> <p>His comments came after revelations last week about Charing Cross police station, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/nine-metropolitan-police-officers-suspended\">allegations of excessive force, racism and misogyny</a> came to light not as a result of the Met’s efforts, but because of a media investigation.</p> <p>Nine officers have been suspended and others moved in what Rowley said was another sign of the force’s determination to root out wrongdoing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Thousands of dodos could return within a decade according to Colossal Biosciences, a ‘de-extinction’ company – but experts warn of ‘moral hazard’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Since its demise in the 17th century, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/31/gene-editing-company-hopes-to-bring-dodo-back-to-life\">dodo</a> has long been synonymous with extinction. But thousands of dodos could soon again populate Mauritius, the species’ former home, according to a “de-extinction” company that has announced a major breakthrough in its quest to resurrect the flightless bird.</p> <p>Colossal Biosciences said on Wednesday it has succeeded in growing pigeon primordial germ cells, precursor cells to sperm and eggs, for the first time. This is a “pivotal step” in bringing back the dodo, which was a type of pigeon, for the first time in more than 300 years, according to Colossal.</p> <p>The Texas-based company, which has made splashy headlines for its plans to reestablish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/04/genetically-modified-woolly-mice-mammoth\">wooly mammoths</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/08/the-de-extinction-of-the-dire-wolf-is-jurassic-park-really-happening\">dire wolves</a>, said it has also developed gene-edited chickens that will act as surrogates for the dodos. The chickens will be injected with primordial germ cells from Nicobar pigeons, the closest living relatives of dodos, which will in time, after gene edits to recreate the create the desired body and head shape, allow them to breed dodos.</p> <p>“Rough ballpark, we think it’s still five to seven years out, but it’s not 20 years out,” Ben Lamm, Colossal’s chief executive, said about the timeline for the dodo’s return. Colossal is working with wildlife groups to identify safe, rat-free sites in Mauritius where the species could once again roam.</p>    <p>“Our goal is to make enough dodos with enough genetic diversity engineered into them that we can put them back into the wild where they can truly thrive,” he said. “So we’re not looking to make two dodos, we’re looking to make thousands.”</p> <p>Dodos once plodded the forests of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, without predators until humans started killing them in earnest, a process accelerated by European exploration and expansion.</p> <p>Habitat loss and introduced invasive species, such as macaques, pigs and rats that raided dodo nests, sealed the fate of the largely defenseless, fruit-eating bird. The last reliable sighting of a dodo came from a Dutch sailor, who described it as a “kind of very big goose” in 1662.</p> <p>The dodo has since become a byword for extinction but Colossal has said it is confident its methods, centered on its <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR\">Crispr</a> gene editing technology, can turn the clock back and return dodos to their former home.</p> <p>Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s scientific chief who has a tattoo of a dodo on her arm, said the “super exciting” breakthrough came following a year of work to gene-edit birds, which are more complex to work on in this way than mammals.</p> <p>“This isn’t a process where we’re going to one day just throw thousands of dodos into Mauritius. Obviously it will be a slow and careful and deliberate process,” said Shapiro.</p> <p>“If we can put back a large ground-dwelling fruit-eating bird, we don’t know all of the consequences of putting them back on this landscape, but we anticipate that we will have some happy surprises.”</p> <p>Some experts, however, have questioned how to define these gene-edited species and what their roles would be in ecosystems degraded by human encroachment and the climate crisis. Leonardo Campagna, an evolutionary biologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said Colossal has made “some remarkable progress” but its dodo work faces numerous challenges.</p> <p>“It’s hard to know what it took to make a dodo genetically, from its genomic architecture to how its genes interacted with the environment,” Campagna said.</p> <p>“Building an organism that looks like what we know the dodo did or behaved, which may not be the complete picture to begin with, including the unique shape of its face, its funny wings or its overall large size is an arduous endeavor.</p> <p>“I’d be curious to see a pigeon like that. But is this in fact the dodo? We need to acknowledge that there is a lot we don’t know and maybe never will.”</p> <p>About 2m species are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/08/species-at-risk-extinction-doubles-to-2-million-aoe\">currently at risk of extinction</a>, with animals and plants being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/a-climate-of-unparalleled-malevolence-are-we-on-our-way-to-the-sixth-major-mass-extinction\">threatened</a> by the razing of habitat, rising temperatures, pollution, invasive species and hunting. The current extinction rate is hundreds of times <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/biodiversity/biodiversity/\">faster</a> than the historic norm, scientists estimate, due to the impact of humanity.</p> <p>While Colossal claims that its technology can aid endangered species rather than just resurrect lost relics, some experts claim its work diverts attention from threats to the natural world.</p> <p>Rich Grenyer, a biologist at the University of Oxford, said de-extinction is a “dangerous” distraction and that gene-edited animals are “at best a sort of simulation, rather like those unnerving animated AI portraits of dead relatives sometimes see people create”.</p> <p>“By labelling genetically engineered modern species as extinct ones brought back from the dead, if it takes off, it’s a huge moral hazard; a massive enabler for the activities that causes species to go extinct in the first place – habitat destruction, mass killing and anthropogenic climate change,” he said.</p> <p>“There’s also of course the question of where you’re going to put your newly engineered hybrids, if they’re not just going to be curiosities in a zoo, because it’s generally the lack of habitat that caused the problem in the first place.”</p>    <p>Colossal’s ongoing ascent, though, was underlined on Wednesday when it announced it extended its funding round by $120m, with the company now valued at $10.2bn. Celebrity investors, such as Tom Brady, Paris Hilton and Tiger Woods, have <a href=\"https://colossal.com/colossal-is-the-real-life-blockbuster-of-jurassic-park-and-indiana-jones-with-celebs-like-tom-brady-behind-it/\">flocked</a> to the the business.</p> <p>Peter Jackson, the Lord of the Rings director and another investor, appeared in a recent Colossal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg5skhUStRI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> to promote its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/11/de-extinction-extinct-giant-moa-bird-colossal-bioscience-aoe\">effort to de-extinct the moa</a>, an enormous flightless bird once found in Jackson’s native New Zealand.</p> <p>Lamm said Colossal’s activities should act in tandem with other conservation work and that its recent announcements would help inspire people about science.</p> <p>“The dire wolf is a monumental feat of genome engineering that has never been achieved before by any academic lab or by any other company ever, it is literally a testament to science, it’s a Dolly-esque moment full stop,” he said, in reference to the famously <a href=\"https://www.nms.ac.uk/discover-catalogue/the-story-of-dolly-the-sheep\">cloned sheep</a>.</p> <p>“These are dodos, and I’m sure there will be some people who say, ‘Oh, well, we don’t like them. We’re not going to call them dodos,’” Lamm said of the latest Colossal project.</p> <p>“Then don’t. We just don’t care, and the more you don’t call them a dodo, the more controversy you drive, the more my numbers go up. So that’s great. So whatever you want to call them, as long as you’re calling them something.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Top former officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr\">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> of hobbling the country’s ability to respond to outbreaks and disease threats.</p> <p>The two officials testified at a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) committee. Susan Monarez, the CDC director chosen by Kennedy, was fired after less than a month. Debra Houry, chief medical officer at the CDC, resigned after serving under six CDC directors during both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p> <p>On the morning of 25 August, Kennedy demanded that Monarez “commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation, regardless of the scientific evidence”, she testified. He also directed her to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy without cause, she said.</p> <p>“He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign. I responded that I could not pre-approve recommendations without reviewing the evidence, and I had no basis to fire scientific experts,” Monarez believes that’s the true reason she was fired, she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data\">US health officials to revisit vaccine policies using anti-vax tactics, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kennedy was “very upset” and “tense” in their meeting. He spoke of the CDC and its employees in a “hurtful and disparaging” manner, Monarez said.</p> <p>“He called, in that context, CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world. He emphasized that CDC employees were horrible people,” she said. “He said that CDC employees were killing children, and they don’t care.”</p> <p>Monarez went on to say that based on what she observed during her tenure, “there is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need, without rigorous scientific review. With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted.”</p> <p>She continued: “The stakes are not theoretical. We already have seen the largest measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children. If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return.”</p> <p>Also on 25 August, Monarez said Kennedy told her “the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September, and I needed to be on board with it”. She said Kennedy had the support of the Trump White House, with Kennedy claiming to her that “he spoke to the President every day about changing the childhood vaccine schedule”.</p> <p>The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, ACIP, which has been replaced with Kennedy’s handpicked advisers, will meet on Thursday and Friday. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who chairs the committee, recently called for an indefinite postponement of the ACIP meeting.</p> <p>“If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy, who is a physician, <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures\">said</a> on 28 August.</p> <p>ACIP will reportedly take up a vote on the current recommendation that the hepatitis B vaccine be given at birth.</p> <p>“Folks know I’m a physician – as it turns out I am a hepatologist, which is a liver specialist,” Cassidy said. “I have seen people die from hepatitis.”</p> <p>More than 90% of children infected at birth develop chronic, lifelong infections and risk liver cancer, he said.</p> <p>“Now that we’ve controlled it, do we let the genie out of the bottle if the recommendation goes away?” Cassidy asked.</p> <p>Debra Houry also testified to seeing political interference and said she “resigned because CDC leaders were reduced to rubber stamps, supporting policies not based in science, and putting American lives at risk.” She said Kennedy “censored CDC science, politicized its processes and stripped leaders of independence.”</p> <p>Approximately 80% of center directors are now acting because career officials have been fired, resigned or retired, Houry said.</p> <p>These unprecedented changes come as the CDC and its employees face violence and threats. On 8 August, a shooter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/atlanta-cdc-shooting\">unloaded more than 500 rounds</a> on the CDC headquarters, with 180 bullets hitting the building. Houry said her staff was “traumatized”.</p> <p>Kennedy did not call Monarez following the shooting, Monarez testified. Such violence following decades of misinformation and harassment of scientific officials has sweeping repercussions. Some CDC staff will now not put their names on scientific reports on vaccines to protect themselves and their families.</p> <p>Houry first learned that Kennedy had changed the CDC’s Covid vaccine guidance in a Twitter/X post.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/cdc-leadership-loss-experts-alarmed\">‘Americans should be alarmed’: Experts say loss of expertise at CDC will harm US health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“CDC scientists have still not seen the scientific data or justification for this change,” she said.</p> <p>Houry testified that she has never briefed the secretary, nor have her center directors – even as the worst measles outbreak in decades unfolded. She also pushed back on misinformation from the secretary: “He said things like vaccines had fetal parts, and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation. We were also asked to include things like budesonide and clarithromycin in our toolkits for physicians, and I couldn’t allow that, as there wasn’t evidence for that and would result in harm.”</p> <p>The new restrictions on Covid vaccines have led to chaos and confusion with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/covid-vaccine-boosters-rfk\">updated vaccine rollout</a>, though Kennedy testified before the finance committee on 4 September that “anybody can get the booster.”</p> <p>“My mom lives in Virginia, and she was unable to get it,” Houry said.</p> <p>The HHS also interfered with information about thimerosal (also known as thiomersal), a preservative demonstrated to be safe, and allowed an “unvetted presentation” on thimerosal to occur in the June ACIP meeting, she said.</p> <p>“That kind of last-minute alteration undermines confidence and the deliberations that follow,” Houry said.</p> <p>The vaccine advisers ultimately voted to ban thimerosal, which is used in about 4% of flu vaccines in the US. If vaccine-preventable diseases are allowed to continue rising, “it’s going to be heartbreaking,” Houry said.</p> <p>Houry added that she’s “concerned about the future of CDC and public health in our country.</p> <p>“We are not prepared, not just for pandemics, but for preventing chronic health disease, and we’re going to see kids dying of vaccine-preventable diseases,” she continued.</p> <p>Kennedy said in the finance committee hearing a few weeks ago that Monarez told him she was untrustworthy. Monarez then said in Wednesday’s hearing: “He told me he could not trust me because I had shared information related to our conversation beyond his staff. I told him, if you cannot trust me, then you can fire me.”</p> <p>The issue under debate on Wednesday went beyond the circumstances of Monarez’s and Houry’s departure, said senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/berniesanders\">Bernie Sanders</a>.</p> <p>“It is about Secretary Kennedy’s dangerous war on science, public health and the truth itself. It is absurd to have to say this in the year 2025, but vaccines are safe and effective.”</p>",

especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society”.</p> <p>Legal experts and conservative pundits have condemned the comments because there is no “hate speech” exception in the first amendment right to speech and as such, targeting people for their charged rhetoric would be unconstitutional.</p> <p>“There is no unprotected category of speech in the constitution or in the

Representatives, and her husband.</p> <p>While some people on both sides of the aisle have spoken about the need for respectful dialogue, Trump and others in his administration have continued to largely blame the violence on the left and warned of a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-podcast\">vast domestic terror movement</a>” prompting fears he

I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.</p> <p>We start with news that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has vowed to stop the “radical left media” from “destroying” the nation</strong>. Taking to his social media platform Truth Social, the president said that he had received “amazing” feedback on his case against the New York Times.</p> <p>“The predominant feeling and sentiment is, “IT’S ABOUT TIME!” he wrote. “The Radical Left Media is working hard to destroy the U.S.A. We are going to stop them at each and every level!!!”</p> <p>In a $15bn case filed in the Florida courts, Trump has accused the NYT of spreading “false and defamatory” content about him.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the NYT said: “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favour and stand up for journalists’ first amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”</p> <p>The case is the latest of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits Trump has launched against US media outlets since his return to the White House.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>Utah county attorney <strong>Jeff Gray</strong> formally announced charges against <strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, the suspect accused of fatally shooting <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>. Prosecutors have charged Robinson on seven counts, including aggravated murder, and will seek the death penalty. Later, Robinson made his first court appearance at a virtual hearing, wearing an anti-suicide smock, where Utah judge <strong>Tony F. Graf </strong>ruled Robinson qualifies for a court-appointed attorney and granted a pre-trial protective order for Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The next hearing in Robinson’s case is scheduled for September 29, and will be conducted virtually.</p></li> <li><p>FBI director Kash Patel faced questions from the Senate judiciary committee during a more than four hour long hearing. The hearing twice included a shouting match between Patel and Democratic senator <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c990818f0870640b690afb#block-68c990818f0870640b690afb\">Cory Booker</a></strong> and later <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-new-york-times-defamation-charlie-kirk-vance-miller-news-updates-us-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c9a1958f0862eec18cf4ef#block-68c9a1958f0862eec18cf4ef\">Adam Schiff</a></strong>. Patel defended his leadership of the FBI, denying that he has politicized the agency and ordered firings of agents and personnel over their work on cases related to Trump or the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Patel also defended his actions over prematurely posting on social media that the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing had been found, only for that person to be released. Democratic senator <strong>Dick Durbin</strong> and others said Patel’s actions pointed to his lack of experience and “sparked mass confusion” during the investigation.</p></li> <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> will appeal the court decision blocking<strong> Trump’s </strong>bid to fire Federal Reserve governor <strong>Lisa Cook</strong>. Yesterday, a US appeals court declined to allow Trump to fire Cook, in the latest step in a legal battle that threatens the Fed’s longstanding independence.</p></li> <li><p>Four people have been arrested after images of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> alongside deceased sex offender <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\">Jeffrey Epstein</a></strong> were projected on to Windsor Castle, where the US president is set to be hosted by King Charles during his state visit to Britain. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">arrived in Britain late on Tuesday</a> for an unprecedented second state visit, and will be greeted by Charles on Wednesday for a day of pomp at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles west of London.</p></li> <li><p>Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> said that<strong> Trump</strong> has invited him back to the White House on September 29. The trip will be the fourth time Netanyahu, a vocal supporter of Trump’s, has visited the White House since Trump’s second term began in January.</p></li> <li><p>California governor <strong>Gavin Newsom </strong>joined a host of Democratic influencers and officials for a virtual rally in support of Proposition 50, also known as the Election Rigging Response Act. The act seeks to redraw California’s political map, in response to efforts by politicians in Republican-led states to do the same.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

    "description": "<p>Gardaí believe body is that of Daniel Aruebose, whose 2022 disappearance was not noticed by authorities until last month</p>",
    "content": "<p>Irish police investigating the fate of a boy who disappeared four years ago but was only registered by authorities as missing last month have found the remains of a child on Dublin wasteland.</p> <p>Gardaí named the missing boy as Daniel Aruebose, who is thought to have vanished in 2022 aged three, after they discovered the remains on Wednesday in the Donabate area of north Dublin.</p> <p>Officers secured the scene pending examinations by a pathologist and forensic anthropologist. Police believe the body is that of Daniel but formal identification must await DNA analysis.</p> <p>Specialist teams and a cadaver dog began the search on 1 September after authorities became aware that the child was missing.</p> <p>The case has put renewed scrutiny on child welfare services after it emerged Daniel had been missing for four years without authorities knowing. Another child, Kyran Durnin, disappeared in 2022 but was not noticed by authorities until August last year.</p> <p>The alarm was first raised over Daniel in late August when the department of social protection alerted Ireland’s child and family agency, Tusla, to irregularities in an application for child support payments. Tusla alerted the police, who made house-to-house inquiries at the Gallery apartment complex in Dublin where Daniel had previously lived, before launching what turned into a 17-day search of open ground.</p> <p>Police urged anyone with relevant information to come forward and appealed to the public to beware “speculation, rumours and theories” about what happened to Daniel. “An Garda Síochána appeals to all members of the public to independently verify any information that you are reading on social media and/or messaging apps,” said a statement.</p> <p>The children’s minister, Norma Foley, said the death of a child was always heartbreaking and upsetting. “But it is especially so for those who knew and loved this child. I extend my very sincere sympathy to all involved.”</p> <p>Tusla confirmed earlier this month it had been in contact with Daniel and his parents in 2020. The agency arranged foster care for the boy but his parents then decided to keep him, leading to Tusla closing the case.</p> <p>The case has been referred to the independent National Review Panel for investigation and the government has instructed Tusla to undertake “wellbeing checks” on other cases closed during the pandemic.</p> <p>The case shares eerie parallels with that of Kyran Durnin, who was last seen in May 2022 when he was six and a pupil at a primary school in Dundalk, County Louth, but whose disappearance was only confirmed last year. If still alive he would be nine. Police took the unusual step of opening a murder investigation even though no body has been found.</p> <p>Simon Harris, who was taoiseach when the disappearance was noticed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/irish-pm-says-case-of-boy-whose-disappearance-went-unnoticed-is-disturbing\">called the case deeply disturbing</a>. “For any of us as a human being, for any of us parents, to think that a child can effectively disappear and go unnoticed … is utterly heartbreaking and clearly something went extraordinarily wrong here.”</p>",

    "title": "For Lionel Messi and Inter Miami MLS Cup, not league success, rules all",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/17/lionel-messi-and-inter-miami-supporters-shield-mls-cup",
    "description": "<p>The Javier Mascherano-led side has an outside chance of repeating as Supporters’ Shield winners, but MLS Cup remains the ultimate goal</p>",
    "content": "<p>Much about Tuesday night in Fort Lauderdale was typical. The weather was sticky and humid. The crowd at Chase Stadium was lively. And on the field, Lionel Messi assisted Jordi Alba, and vice-versa, in a 3-1 win for Inter Miami. That the victory came against the Seattle Sounders, the side that beat Miami in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/luis-suarez-spit-inter-miami-seattle-sounders-leagues-cup-final\">contentious Leagues Cup final</a> two weeks ago, gave the squad a measure of revenge. But there are bigger factors at play.</p> <p>“It was important to regain positive feelings,” Miami head coach Javier Mascherano told reporters afterward.</p> <p>Indeed, between the Seattle game and a subsequent loss to Charlotte FC, Miami had not just suffered two consecutive shutout losses, but they were depleted due to injuries and suspensions (Luis Suárez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/luis-suarez-suspension-mls-leagues-cup-final-inter-miami\">due to his antics in the Leagues Cup final</a> and Tomas Avilés for a red card against Charlotte). Inter Miami only had six players on the bench on Tuesday; two were 18-year-old academy products and another was 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti, who just arrived from Newell’s Old Boys.</p> <p>Despite this, Miami’s win pushed them to fifth in the Eastern Conference on 49 points – eight behind the leaders, Philadelphia Union. With three games in hand, Inter Miami still have a chance at repeating last season’s achievement: finishing at the top of the East and winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield, given to the club with the best regular-season record.</p> <p>The ultimate goal, though, is altogether different: win MLS Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/15/new-england-revolution-fire-caleb-porter\">New England Revolution fire head coach Caleb Porter after less than two seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The league championship has been the most coveted objective for the Herons. There is an argument that winning the Concacaf Champions Cup is perhaps more prestigious due to its continental scale, or that the Shield is the trophy that most resembles league titles in most other competitions worldwide. But MLS Cup is the trophy that matters to the most important people: the fans. From Atlanta United’s tremendous victory in 2018 with Miguel Almirón and Josef Martínez to Carlos Vela, Gareth Bale and the Mexican-American euphoria with LAFC in 2022, and even going back to DC United’s inaugural victory in 1996, winning MLS Cup is an achievement that permeates across a club’s community and history.</p> <p>Naturally, every MLS team wants that title. The difference with Inter Miami is that the stakes are so much higher simply because they have Messi. With 46 trophies to his name, no one in the game has more silverware, and the pressure for him to win MLS Cup is less on him and more on the club as a whole to deliver a championship to add to that list.</p> <p>Because of his arrival and everything that has occurred since, Inter Miami are one of the biggest marketing attractions in the league, second in value to LAFC, per Forbes. According to research firm SponsorUnited, subscriptions to MLS’s Season Pass broadcast package on Apple TV more than doubled since Messi came to the league, and sponsorship revenue jumped 13% last year to $665m. Other clubs have also benefited. Sporting Kansas City, for example, hosted Inter Miami at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium in 2024, drawing a club record crowd of 72,610. In addition, Inter Miami’s new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, is set to open next year and there is hope that Messi will still be around to lead them into their new home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/03/bundesliga-mark-goldbridge-mls-apple-streaming\">The Bundesliga’s deal with Mark Goldbridge is odd, and exactly what MLS is missing with Apple</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I previously said that my wish, my dream would be for the No 10 to inaugurate our new stadium in March,” Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas told ESPN this summer. “This is a decision that rests on Messi. We wish for Messi to finish his career here.”</p> <p>Yet at the time of writing, there has been no official word regarding the extension. The prospect of opening the stadium as MLS Cup champions will no doubt be enticing to Messi, though. He faced a similar dynamic after finally capturing the 2022 World Cup, when he could have retired from the national team at 34 years old but chose to continue playing with his country so he could do so as a world champion.</p> <p>Inter Miami have achieved much in the Messi era, including a points record in a Supporters’ Shield season in 2024 and a run to the round of 16 in the Club World Cup, which featured a 2-1 victory over FC Porto, making them the first Concacaf team to beat a Uefa side in official competition.</p> <p>MLS Cup, though, is an entirely different type of competition – the capstone to playoffs that are a season unto themselves, where results from the regular season don’t mean much aside from determining the matchups. Miami know this as well as anyone, having lost in the first round last year in one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/inter-miami-atlanta-united-game-report-lionel-messi\">most shocking upsets in league history</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/04/messi-scores-in-home-farewell-for-argentina-and-remains-tight-lipped-on-world-cup\">Messi scores in home farewell for Argentina and remains tight-lipped on World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time around, Mascherano will know that Messi, now 38, is close to the end of his career. The need to win with Inter Miami is becoming urgent. And some things will need to improve.</p> <p>To maximize their chances of success, Miami must deliver a more consistent tone, both in the playing of the game and the mentality with which they approach it. Suárez’s conduct in the Leagues Cup final doesn’t help things, and he’s not the only one who has had disciplinary issues. Out of 30 clubs, Inter Miami are ninth in the disciplinary standings but with far fewer matches played. Mascherano manages as he used to play – aggressively – and that can be both a strength and a weakness.</p> <p>There’s little doubt that Inter Miami will make the playoffs, and there’s also a chance that the club can top the East again as their remaining matches – aside from Nashville SC on the final day of the season – are against teams in lower positions.</p> <p>But that’s not the goal. The Philadelphia Union, FC Cincinnati, Charlotte FC and Florida rivals Orlando City are among the teams standing in Miami’s way in the East playoffs. All except Philly have beaten the Herons this season, and all are capable of doing so again (and that’s before getting into a potential final matchup against high-flying San Diego FC, Son Heung-min’s LAFC, the tactically clever Minnesota United, history-making Vancouver Whitecaps, a rematch against the Seattle Sounders, or whoever else comes out of the West).</p> <p>The road to MLS Cup is realistic and achievable for Inter Miami, but it comes with numerous obstacles.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The prime minister and the chancellor are running out of time to convince their own MPs that they have a plan to turn things around</p>",
    "content": "<p>At the start of this month, Sir Keir Starmer initiated “phase two” of his government, with a view to turning its fortunes around. Then the deputy prime&nbsp;minister&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/angela-rayner-stands-down-over-stamp-duty-row\">resigned</a> over unpaid taxes. On the eve&nbsp;of a state visit&nbsp;by the US president, the ambassador&nbsp;to Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">was sacked</a> over his friendship with a convicted paedophile, and this week&nbsp;a senior adviser&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/senior-starmer-adviser-paul-ovenden-quits-over-offensive-diane-abbott-messages\">resigned</a> over offensive text messages.</p> <p>Those are just the personnel problems. The new phase is supposed to focus on policy delivery, but that is hard to achieve with a sluggish economy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live\">sticky inflation</a> and shrinking fiscal headroom.</p> <p>This week it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast#:~:text=The%20Office%20for%20Budget%20Responsibility,significant%20action%20in%20the%20budget.\">was reported</a> that the Office for Budget Responsibility expects to downgrade its estimates of UK productivity in advance of the budget in December. The knock-on effect would be to narrow the chancellor’s capacity for funding public services. The shortfall could be up to £30bn. Much of that will have to come from tax rises. Rachel Reeves’s last attempt to plug a fiscal hole with spending cuts led to a raid on benefits that had to be largely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/27/no-10-climb-down-over-welfare-bill-move-win-rebels\">aborted to quell</a> a mass rebellion of Labour MPs.</p> <p>The government still intends to find savings in that&nbsp;area. It is the unenviable job of Pat McFadden, the&nbsp;new work and pensions secretary, to find a way that&nbsp;doesn’t reignite backbench fury.</p> <p>Even if Ms Reeves succeeds in bringing restive Labour colleagues on board with her budget, she will face a ferocious onslaught from opposition parties and rightwing media for raising taxes. She will be accused of reneging on promises not to burden “working people” with higher levies, even if she adheres to the letter of the manifesto commitment not to hike income tax, national insurance, VAT and&nbsp;corporation tax.</p> <p>The government will blame its economic predicament on the Tories. It is true that Sir Keir inherited a public realm in disrepair, and wafer-thin margins for fiscal manoeuvre are partly a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/revealed-the-30bn-cost-of-liz-trusss-disastrous-mini-budget\">legacy of Liz Truss</a> incinerating British financial credibility. But they are also a function of choices made by Ms&nbsp;Reeves in opposition. Now, 14 months after the general election, the public wants more evidence of improvement, and fewer excuses.</p> <p>Most people accept that it takes time to fix&nbsp;something that was very broken, but they need&nbsp;confidence that there is a plan; that leaders&nbsp;have a national destination in mind and a&nbsp;route map to get&nbsp;there.</p> <p>Failure to articulate such a thing has badly damaged Sir Keir. It doesn’t account for the full collapse in his poll rating since the general election last year, but the absence of an optimistic message has been an aggravating factor whenever there have&nbsp;been other setbacks. It has accelerated the decline in mood among Labour MPs from anxiety&nbsp;to&nbsp;panic. There are mutterings about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">replacing the prime minister</a> if things continue on the current trajectory.</p> <p>It is not too late to stabilise the situation. A sustained absence of unforced errors and scandal would be a start. It would buy space in which to set out a credible offer of economic renewal, narrated with conviction as part of a wider story of national purpose. The ability to make such a case is a core competence in any prime minister.</p> <p>If Sir Keir cannot demonstrate it soon, he should expect his party to advance from doubting his leadership to seeking an alternative.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "<p>Version of company’s Gemini 2.5 AI model solved complex real-world problem that stumped human programmers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Google DeepMind claims it has made a “historic” artificial intelligence breakthrough akin to the Deep Blue computer defeating Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/09/google-deepmind-alphago-ai-defeats-human-lee-sedol-first-game-go-contest#:~:text=Google's%20AlphaGo%20AI%20defeats%20human,intelligence%20(AI)%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">an AI</a> beating a human Go champion in 2016.</p> <p>A version of the company’s Gemini 2.5 AI model solved a complex real-world problem that stumped human computer programmers to become the first AI model to win a gold medal at an international programming competition held earlier this month in Azerbaijan.</p> <p>In a performance that the tech company called a “profound leap in abstract problem-solving”, it took less than half an hour to work out how to weigh up an infinite number of possibilities in order to send a liquid through a network of ducts to a set of interconnected reservoirs. The goal was to distribute it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>None of the human teams, including the top performers from universities in Russia, China and Japan, got it right.</p> <p>It failed two of the 12 tasks it was set, but its overall performance ranked it in second place out of 139 of the world’s strongest college-level computer programmers. Google said it was a “historic moment, towards AGI [artificial general intelligence]”, which is widely considered human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.</p> <p>“For me it’s a moment that is equivalent to Deep Blue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go,” said Quoc Le, Google DeepMind’s vice-president. “Even bigger, it is reasoning more towards the real world, not just a constrained environment [like Chess and Go] … Because of that I think this advance has the potential to transform many scientific and engineering disciplines.” He cited drug and chip design.</p> <p>The model is a general purpose AI but was specially trained to solve very hard coding, maths and reasoning problems. It performed “as well as a top 20 coder in the world”, Google said.</p> <p>“Solving complex tasks at these competitions requires deep abstract reasoning, creativity, the ability to synthesise novel solutions to problems never seen before and a genuine spark of ingenuity,” the company said.</p>    <p>Speaking before the details were made public, Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, said the “claims of epochal significance seem overblown”. He said AI systems had been doing well on programming tasks for a while and the Deep Blue chess breakthrough had “essentially no impact on the real world of applied AI”.</p> <p>However, he said “to get an ICPC question right, the code actually has to work correctly (at least on a finite number of test cases), so this performance may show progress towards making AI-based coding systems sufficiently accurate for producing high-quality code”.</p> <p>He added: “The pressure on AI companies to keep claiming breakthroughs is enormous”.</p> <p>Michael Wooldridge, Ashall professor of the foundations of artificial intelligence at the University of Oxford, said it sounded like an impressive achievement and “being able to solve problems at this level is exciting”. But he questioned how much computing power was needed. Google declined to say, apart from confirming it was more than available to an average subscriber to its $250-a-month Google AI Ultra service using the lightweight version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini App.</p> <p>Dr Bill Poucher, executive director of the ICPC, said: “Gemini successfully joining this arena, and achieving gold-level results, marks a key moment in defining the AI tools and academic standards needed for the next generation.”</p> <h2>Four machine intelligence breakthroughs</h2> <h2><strong>1957 The Perceptron</strong></h2> <p>Frank Rosenblatt, an academic at Cornell University,worked out that it should be possible to create a “perceiving and recognising automaton”. He named it the Perceptron and <a href=\"https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/websites.umass.edu/dist/a/27637/files/2016/03/rosenblatt-1957.pdf\">said</a> an electronic system would be able to learn to recognised patterns in optical, electrical or tonal information “in a manner which may be closely analogous to the perceptual process of a biological brain”. The following year he built the device, which was the size of a small room. It was considered one of the early breakthroughs in artificial intelligence based on neural networks.</p> <h2><strong>1997 Big Blue</strong></h2> <p>In May 1997, IBM’s Big Blue became the first computer system to defeat a reigning world chess champion in a match under standard tournament controls. It <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/history/deep-blue\">beat</a> Garry Kasparov in what became an inflection point in computing power, but the contest was close. Kasparov won the first game, Deep Blue the second followed by three draws. Deep Blue won game 6 to secure the win. It showed how brute force computing power could create a system to defeat a human, albeit at a narrow task. “The computer is far stronger than anybody expected,” said Kasparov, conceding defeat.</p> <h2><strong>2016</strong> <strong>Alpha</strong><strong>Go</strong></h2> <p>Go is one of the most complex games ever devised, and one of the world’s master players was Lee Sedol, a South Korean professional. In 2016, DeepMind, the UK AI company set up by Demis Hassabis, took him on with its computer AlphaGo. It won 4-1 and some of its moves seemed to display truly original thinking. Move 37 in particular went down in lore. Hassibis <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-story-of-alphago-barbican-centre/kQXBk0X1qEe5KA?hl=en\">said</a>: “It might be the first glimpse of a bright and bold future where humanity harnesses AI as a powerful new tool, helping us discover new knowledge that can solve some of our most pressing scientific problems.”</p> <h2><strong>2020</strong> <strong>AlphaFold</strong></h2> <p>Another breakthrough by Hassibis and DeepMind was an AI program that can predict how proteins fold into 3D shapes, a highly complex process fundamental to understanding life’s biological machinery. The Royal Society, the 360-year old London scientific institution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/30/deepmind-ai-cracks-50-year-old-problem-of-biology-research\">called</a> it “a stunning advance”.</p> <p>When researchers know how a protein folds up, they can start to uncover mysteries such as how insulin controls sugar levels in the blood or how antibodies fight viruses. After further iterations, the system helped Hassibis and his colleague John Jumper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/09/google-deepmind-scientists-win-nobel-chemistry-prize\">share a Nobel prize</a> for chemistry in 2024.</p>",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> addressed the recent killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a> and told a crowd in Pennsylvania on Tuesday the country was “at an inflection point”, but that political violence “is not new” and “has happened at certain periods” in US history.</p> <p>Obama added that despite history, political violence was “anathema to what it means to be a democratic country”.</p> <p>The former president <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOv34VgyPgA\">made the remarks</a> at the Jefferson Educational Society, a non-profit in Erie, Pennsylvania. He explicitly denounced political violence, addressing the fatal attacks this year of Kirk and the Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. He called both incidents “a tragedy” and said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has further divided the country rather than work to bring people together.</p> <p>“There are no ifs, ands or buts about it, the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,” he said.</p> <p>Obama warned that the response to Kirk’s assassination last week, which has kicked off a debate about free speech and the incitement to violence, could serve to deepen political and cultural divisions.</p> <p>“There’s been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we’re going to identify an enemy,” he said.</p> <p>Politicians on the political right, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, have blamed the “radical left” for fostering a dangerous political environment. Many on the left maintain that the claims are a pretext for an authoritarian crackdown on free speech.</p> <p>Obama has kept somewhat of a low profile in his post-presidency. Responding to a moderator’s questions on Tuesday, he addressed Trump’s rhetoric after Kirk’s assassination, as well as other administrative actions.<br><br>The Democrat spoke about his own leadership following the 2015 slaying of nine Black parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina church, as well as George W Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He said he sees the role of a president in a crisis “to constantly remind us of the ties that bind us together”.<br><br>The sentiment among Trump and his aides following Kirk’s killing of calling political opponents “vermin, enemies … speaks to a broader problem”, Obama said.</p> <p>Kirk, a dominant figure in conservative politics, became a confidant of Trump after founding Arizona-based Turning Point USA, one of the nation’s largest political organizations. Trump has escalated threats to crack down on what he describes as the “radical left” following Kirk’s assassination, stirring fears his Republican administration is trying to harness outrage over the killing to suppress political opposition.<br><br>Trump’s White House on Wednesday responded to Obama’s remarks by blaming him for animosity in the country, calling him “the architect of modern political division in America”.<br><br>“Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other, and following his presidency more Americans felt Obama divided the country than felt he united it,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Kirk’s assassination, political leaders including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and Joe Biden and Bush called for an end to political violence and a return to reasonable debate to lower the political temperature in the US.</p> <p>Obama sought to hold a middle ground in his remarks, praising Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, who he said showed “that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate”.</p> <p>The desire to identify an enemy, Obama indicated, was misplaced. “We’re going to suggest that somehow that enemy was at fault, and we are then going to use that as a rationale for trying to silence discussion around who we are as a country and what direction we should go,” Obama continued. “And that’s a mistake as well.”</p> <p>While he believed that Kirk’s ideas “were wrong”, Obama said that “doesn’t negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family”. Denouncing political violence and mourning its victims “doesn’t mean we can’t have a debate about the ideas” that Kirk promoted, he added.</p> <p>“Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people’s right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,” Obama said. “That’s how we should approach this.”</p> <p>Obama on Tuesday also referenced Trump’s recent deployment of National Guard troops in Washington and ID checks by federal agents in Los Angeles. He urged citizens and elected officials to closely monitor the norm-busting decisions.<br><br>“What you’re seeing, I think, is the sense that through executive power, many of the guardrails and norms that I thought I had to abide by as president of the United States, that George Bush thought he had to abide by as president of the United States, that suddenly those no longer apply,” Obama said. “And that makes this a dangerous moment.”</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 17 September 2025.

    "content": "<p>Carol Ann Duffy has written a poem about Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain that appears to reimagine the ceremonial banquet as taking place in a bombsite.</p> <p>Duffy, who was the UK’s poet laureate between 2009 and 2019, writes of the “rocks and rubble” in lines that have the reader contrasting the diamonds of the “great and good” with the ruins left by war.</p> <p>The US president and his wife, Melania, arrived in Windsor on Wednesday morning to be met by the Prince and Princess of Wales, who escorted them to join the king and queen.</p> <p>The monarch is hosting a state banquet for 160 guests in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall on Wednesday evening, at which Trump and Charles will give speeches.</p> <p>Trump promised during his presidential election campaign to bring peace to Ukraine on day one of his second team in the White House, but the war waged by Russia continues.</p> <p>Israel announced a “temporary” new route for residents to flee Gaza City on Wednesday, as it launched an major ground offensive after intense bombardment of the Palestinian territory’s main urban area.</p> <p>Five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the attack on 7 October by Hamas have been civilians, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">figures</a> from a classified Israeli military intelligence database.</p> <p>In Duffy’s poem, entitled STATE/BANQUET, she plays with the ceremonial pomp of the meal and imagines a menu while seemingly inviting readers to think of the plight of those in peril.</p> <p>“Let the trumpets sound on the bombsite,” she writes.</p> <p>Trump is the first US president to be honoured with a second state visit to the UK.

    "description": "<p>Symbols of Christian nationalism were prominent at last Saturday’s ‘unite the kingdom’ march. Their deployment had little to do with religious faith</p>",
    "content": "<p>England’s established church has now been leaderless&nbsp;for going on 10 months, following Justin&nbsp;Welby’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89xz3lg7ydo\">resignation</a> as archbishop of Canterbury. The Crown Nominations Commission is finally <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2025/8-august/news/uk/shortlist-for-next-archbishop-of-canterbury-agreed\">expected</a> to&nbsp;vote on a successor in the coming weeks. Whoever that turns out to be will face familiar and thorny problems, from disagreement over safeguarding structures to the Anglican church’s seemingly unending arguments over sexuality.</p> <p>After last weekend’s “unite the kingdom” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">march</a> in London, a new challenge should be added to the list. Christian nationalism is already a force in the United States, and has played a defining role in European culture wars in countries such as Poland and Hungary. At last Saturday’s rally the striking <a href=\"https://www.premierchristianity.com/news-analysis/crosses-and-bible-verses-dominated-the-tommy-robinson-rally-is-a-new-christian-right-on-the-rise/20080.article\">proliferation</a> of wooden crosses and flags bearing Christian slogans suggest an ominous and rising influence on the British far right. From the speakers’ platform in Whitehall, crowds were led in chants of “Christ is King” and participated in public prayer recitals, while being urged to defend “God, faith, family, homeland”.</p> <p>The secular co-opting of Christian identity to incite racial intolerance and Islamophobia has a track record on these shores. In 2009, the archbishops Rowan&nbsp;Williams and John Sentamu publicly <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8065583.stm\">admonished</a> the British National party for using the language of faith “to foster&nbsp;fear”. But it used to be a relatively fringe pursuit. The rise of Reform, and the embedding of the far right within a broader revolt against mainstream politics, suggests that we are in new territory.</p> <p>As anti-migrant sentiment in Britain is both normalised and radicalised, figures such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, are successfully adopting the Viktor Orbán playbook, casting themselves as defenders of a Christian country under existential threat from outsiders. The crosses, Bible verses and prayers on display at the rally – like the Saint George’s flags appearing in streets across the country – placed a patina of false piety on a nativist message brimming with hostility towards the multicultural reality of modern Britain.</p> <p>In academic literature, the use of Christianity as a cultural dividing line has been aptly <a href=\"https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2018/11/05/christianism-a-crude-political-ideology-and-the-triumph-of-empty-symbolism\">characterised</a> as “Christianism” – an aggressive and exclusionary assertion of “belonging” that need not have any connection with actual religious belief. Battered and&nbsp;bruised though the Church of England may be after Mr Welby’s unhappy departure, it must explore ways to assert itself against such perversions of the gospel message of inclusion and compassion for the stranger.</p> <p>One key to that may lie at grassroots level, where church and interfaith groups are often at the heart of initiatives aimed at enhancing social cohesion and wellbeing. In a <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2025/19-september/news/uk/bishops-reject-intolerance-as-unite-the-kingdom-marchers-descend-on-london\">statement</a> issued prior to last Saturday’s march, the Bishop of Edmonton observed that “every day, in our churches and on our streets, we see a very different city to the one that the marchers portray”. By embodying an ecumenical sense of neighbourliness, local churches can help counter the far right’s pseudo-Christian posturing.</p> <p>Church leaders have a duty to do the same on the national stage. Inveighing against the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportations in February, the late Pope Francis was <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2025/documents/20250210-lettera-vescovi-usa.html\">withering</a> in his condemnation of ethno-nationalism dressed up in a cassock and carrying a cross. In an ever more febrile public square, the next archbishop of Canterbury will also need to be loud and clear in their defence of basic Christian principles.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "<p>The EU has called for closer ties with India while admitting there was no “mutual understanding” with Narendra Modi’s government over Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p> <p>The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, and lead negotiator on trade, Maroš Šefčovič, outlined an EU-India strategy on Wednesday as part of Europe’s drive to build and strengthen alliances in a world shaken by Donald Trump’s challenges to the postwar order.</p> <p>But they did not attempt to hide differences with New Delhi, after Indian forces took part this week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/russia-belarus-military-exercise-stirs-up-unease-in-europes-leaders\">Russia’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/russia-belarus-military-exercise-stirs-up-unease-in-europes-leaders\">Zapad </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/russia-belarus-military-exercise-stirs-up-unease-in-europes-leaders\">(western) military exercises in Belarus </a>that simulated a war with Nato countries.</p> <p>Kallas, who is from Estonia, one of the EU’s frontline states which is seen as vulnerable to a Russian attack, said: “This is a great concern for our countries. I mean if you want closer ties with us then why participate in exercises that are an existential threat to us?”</p> <p>She said there were “clear areas of disagreement” that were obstacles to deeper cooperation, but Europe did not want to push India into “Russia’s corner”. </p>    <p>Commenting on India’s purchases of Russian oil and military exercise participation, Kallas added: “We will definitely always raise these questions and currently we don’t have a mutual understanding here.”</p> <p>The European Commission also objects to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/02/india-buy-oil-russia-despite-trump-tariff-threats\">India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil</a>, which helps Vladimir Putin fund his war on Ukraine.</p> <p>Meanwhile the EU is grappling with demands from Trump to impose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/trump-asks-eu-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-india-and-china-to-put-pressure-on-russia\">up to 100% tariffs on India and China</a>, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.</p> <p>The EU has said it intends to tighten secondary sanctions on non-European actors that are helping Russia evade western restrictions when it publishes its next set of sanctions proposals.</p> <p>But privately, officials have <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/16/why-the-european-union-wont-hit-china-with-the-100-tariffs-that-trump-wants\">balked at 100% tariffs</a>, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.</p> <p>Šefčovič did not respond directly to questions about whether the EU would agree to US demands for 100% tariffs, but said the bloc already had strong measures aimed at stopping circumvention of sanctions.</p> <p>He added: “We are of course coordinating very closely with the United States, but also with other G7 partners because we believe if the G7 acts in the same manner, of course, the impact, then it is much stronger.”</p>    <p>Asked about the link between the trade talks and India’s relations with Russia, Kallas said: “Negotiations are negotiations and until we agree about everything then nothing is agreed.” She added that the EU had to take into account its interests, concerns and “problematic issues”.</p> <p>The strategy paper was published shortly before the Kremlin announced Putin had had a phone call with Modi, where they discussed plans for the Russian president’s visit to India in December.</p> <p>Šefčovič, who is in charge of trade talks, said trade between the EU and India had grown by 90% over the last decade, making the bloc India’s largest trading partner, ahead of the US and China, as well as one of India’s top investors – “and yet I am absolutely convinced that we have only scratched the surface”.</p> <p>But he was also downbeat about the latest round of trade talks, saying he had hoped to see more progress in meetings last week.</p> <p>“What we need is a commercially meaningful, fair agreement and I need the understanding of my Indian counterparts, [that] it must be fair and balanced,” he said, pointing out that any agreement would have to be approved by EU member states and the European parliament.</p> <p>The commission is racing to strike trade deals around the world since Trump hit many European goods with tariffs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/eu-us-trade-deal-tariffs-european-union-five-key-takeaways\">pressured the EU into an unequal trade agreement</a>.</p> <p>But in a sign of Europe’s difficulties in finalising trade deals, the approval of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/eu-farmers-plan-protests-as-von-der-leyen-approves-mercosur-trade-deal\">recent agreement with four South American countries</a> in the Mercosur bloc remains in doubt, amid opposition from France and Poland.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Polish energy minister, Miłosz Motyka, has called on the EU to end Russian oil imports by the end of 2026 “to cease financing Russia’s war machine” and help end the war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>In a letter seen by the Guardian, Motyka argued that “the current international circumstances, combined with the need to strengthen the resilience of European economies, require a common response”.</p> <p>He said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies burdened with political and strategic risks”.</p> <p>Poland also called for “coordinated … compensatory mechanisms” to help with “a fair and orderly transition” for countries most affected, which would also include measures on “safeguarding access to alternative oil sources in the event of disruptions”.</p> <p>The EU has previously pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/17/europe-will-never-return-to-russian-gas-european-commission-insists\">phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028.</a></p>",

Hours after the release, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired</a> McEntarfer, claiming without evidence that the “jobs numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”.</p> <p>It was the first time a president had fired the head of the data bureau, and it left many economists shaken by what the future of the nonpartisan bureau could look like. Trump has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">nominated EJ Antoni</a>, chief economist at the conservative thinktank Heritage Foundation and a co-author of Project 2025, in addition to a vocal critic of BLS, as McEntarfer’s replacement. Antoni has not yet been confirmed by Congress. William Wiatrowski, a longtime official within the bureau, is currently serving as acting commissioner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">Conservatives join backlash over Trump pick for head of labor statistics: ‘Not a credible source of information’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McEntarfer, speaking at Bard College, said that while she trusts Wiatrowski, she is concerned about the future of the bureau.</p> <p>“Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like has serious economic consequences,” she said, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc6be071-ebd5-4b73-82a0-62435cedea26\">noting</a> that the collection of countries that have gone down a similar route, including Argentina, Greece and Turkey, is “not a good list”.</p> <p>“The resulting loss of trust in economics statistics led these countries to worsening economic crises, higher inflation and higher borrowing costs,” McEntarfer said.</p> <p>Even before her firing, McEntarfer said she was prepared to lead the bureau toward modernizing its data collection. But the bureau’s funding dried up, particularly once Trump entered office. Under cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, the bureau’s staff fell 20% since January after hiring freezes and delayed onboarding.</p> <p>McEntarfer said that, once Musk left the White House, she was hoping that the bureau could “return to some sense of normalcy”.</p> <p>But when July’s jobs report was published, McEntarfer said a journalist reached out to her for comment about Trump’s social media post that said he was firing McEntarfer. At first, she didn’t take it seriously, but then she soon got a short email from the White House announcing her termination.</p> <p>“I can vouch for the accuracy and independence of the work of the agency up until the moment I was fired,” McEntarfer <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/fired-bls-chief-breaks-silence-calls-her-dismissal-a-dangerous-step-7e3a6a86?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh-b5KAcZ0oD10alc4TcDMBhJh_QNoHPUzTYyvkl5aVN1h-R1HBYu1CH-d1k4c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68cad0f5&amp;gaa_sig=Xzh61wBBuJwLhE4UmEG2qChZgPK1dW2hg0Vh9qnHwQlEBTojOuPNYGzAZppg5U5GidasFd0owj6DaXC9FaOcEg%3D%3D\">said</a>, in light of Trump’s accusations.

    "description": "<p>The artist and curator of photography talks about her relationship to the work of Black pioneers of photography and the influence of her 2000 book</p>",
    "content": "<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When Dr Deborah Willis was an undergrad student at the Philadelphia College of Art, she asked the question that informed her work for years to follow: “Where are all the Black photographers?”</p> \n<p>From photos by Gordon Parks in Time magazine to Black image-makers capturing daily life in Ebony and Jet magazines – she knew that Black photographers, like her father, were making their impact on the world. Growing up, her father was an amateur photographer, and her father’s cousin owned a photo studio, and seeing them photograph people as a child created a desire in her to become an image-maker.</p> \n<p>At seven years old, she discovered the book The Sweet Flypaper of Life<em> </em>by<em> </em>Langston Hughes and Roy DeCarava; upon seeing its cover image, she had a revolution. “Fast forward, I wanted to be a photographer,” she says.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, her passion for photography would result in pioneering research for her in-depth undergrad paper, which included about 300 names and works by Black photographers. Publisher Richard Newman would recognize the importance of her findings, and together in 2000 they would create Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers: 1840 to the Present – the first comprehensive history of Black photographers.</p> \n<p>Their book reshaped the narrative of America through showcasing to the nation images that centered the point of view and life of the everyday Black person in the moments in which they were facing discrimination and subjected to subhuman treatment.</p> \n<p>On 18 November, a new edition of the book will be released; in coordination she has curated an exhibit titled Reflections in Black: A Reframing on view in New York City. Willis is now a professor and chair of the photography and imaging department at New York University and its Center for Black Visual Culture Institute for African American Affairs. She has also published many other books and held several teaching positions and, in a full circle moment, she was curator of photographs and prints at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture which served as her guiding light as she did her undergrad research.</p> \n<p>She hopes Reflections in Black allows people to rethink their stereotypes of Blackness. “I want people to see that this work that the artists are making is about freedom, freedom to express that voice that James Baldwin always talked about,” she says. “Freedom to think of progress and to see the new narratives that are not based on others who only see Black people as othered and demeaning … and see it as an intervention.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2025/09/2025-focus-layer-atoms/black-photography-gallery\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Throughout the book, she guides the audience through pivotal moments that informed the image-making process of Black photographers. First, daguerreotypes invented by Louis Daguerre were the first successful photographic process introduced to the public in 1839. This new image-making technique that shaped photography from 1840 to 1900 allowed Black photographers such as James P Ball, Glenalvin Goodridge, and Augustus Washington t​​o make portraits of the everyday African American.</p> \n<p>From 1900 to 1940, Black photographers started to have their own studios, allowing photography to become more accessible during a time in which Black people were facing segregation and discrimination.</p> \n<p>“One need only peruse the visual representations of Black people commonly produced on postcards and sheet music to realize that the exaggerated features and demeaning situations depicted there left an enduring negative impact, one that has endured to this day,” Willis writes in Reflections in Black. “Most of their African American clients wanted to celebrate their achievements and establish a counter-image that conveyed a sense of self and self-­worth.”</p> \n<p>From 1930 to 1940, Black photographers such as Gordon Parks, Vera Jackson, and Arthur Eddie Williamson began working as photojournalists for local newspapers and magazines, such as Our World, Ebony, Sepia and Flash, which were marketed to Black readers. Their photographs became a more comprehensive coverage of political events and protests, with the help of smaller handheld cameras in the 1930s.</p> \n<p>Black image-makers in the 1950s to 1960s, such as Doug Harris, Elaine Tomlin, and Bobo Fletcher, began to study photography in workshops, art schools, and community centers. “Many of these photographers were determined to awaken social consciousness,” Willis notes in the first edition of Reflections in Black. “Their work is a testimony to the depth of understanding and love these photographers have for humanity.”</p> \n<p>From the 1980s to the 1990s, work by photographers such as Coreen Simpson began to be viewed as fine art, combining graphic abstraction and conceptual photography. Many of these images were “informed by their families and explored how they dealt with social issues like racism, unemployment, and child and sexual abuse”, Willis writes. Photographers ask their viewers to “contextualize his or her own experience within the visual referents offered by the photographer, and in doing so to find her or his own historical perspective, interpretation, or meaning in these works”, Willis writes.</p> \n<p>Currently, she is intrigued by photographers who are asking difficult questions about their personal and family lives while creating abstract photographs and using colors to photograph their environment. “Photographers are documenting, but they’re also making and asking questions about the future,” she says. “At the same time, they’re finding ways to celebrate the lives that have been lived and using new technologies to make three-dimensional images, making them monumental.”</p> \n<p>The Black New Vanguard, a term coined by Antwaun Sargen, a writer, editor and curator, recognizes the current decision by photographers like Tyler Mitchell and Adama Delphine Fawundu to move photography forward by adding film-making, memory studies and historical references to their process. Willis says in this movement, “you just find pleasure, you just find passion, and so I see that in some other ways that the new vanguard, that they are looking at ways to find pleasure and joy in their experiences, as they experience the difficult moments”.</p> \n<p>As the photographers adapted and changed their style, for Willis the concept of beauty has an everlasting presence in the work of Black image-makers. She began to notice the presence of everyday beauty in her mother’s salon growing up. “I learned beauty matters for women of all ages and all disciplines,” she says. But her experiences in 2001, transformed how she defined beauty. That year was a “shocking, awful, and surprising experience”, as she describes it.</p> \n<p>After winning the MacArthur award that year, her 27-year-old nephew was killed during an altercation at a nightclub in Philadelphia when he was on his way to help her install an art exhibit she curated in DC. The first thing she said to herself upon hearing about his death was, “These kids did not know love. How could you not know love? How could they not see his beauty? How could that happen?”</p> \n<p>Months later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and as a result she began to lose her hair, and noticed how uncomfortable people became with her bald head and lack of eyebrows. “Even in illness, beauty is important, because people would say some horrible things, and be insensitive to the fact that I’m dealing with my mortality,” she notes.</p> \n<p>“I thought about Toni Morrison and her work, and she said, ‘Beauty is,’ and then just those two words meant so much to me,” she says. “I started thinking about images from the 19th century, how Black women who were enslaved, how they began to adorn themselves, and why it was important for them to see themselves as human.”</p> \n<p>In the new edition of Reflections in Black, she continues her mission by not portraying beauty as a performance, but by illuminating the quiet everyday moments of Black life that are full of hope, struggle, resilience and joy</p> \n<p>“I’m hoping people will see that [Black] people are not performing” Willis says. “[and] that we are human.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Reflections in Black: A Reframing is now on display at New York University’s Cooper Square Gallery until 15 October</p></li> \n</ul>",

    "description": "<p>Chronology of Axel Rudakubana’s engagement with Camhs published and inquiry hears statement from killer’s brother</p>",
    "content": "<p>Axel Rudakubana was discharged from mental health services six days before he murdered three young girls and stabbed several others at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport, it has emerged.</p> <p>The inquiry into the atrocity was told on Wednesday that a risk assessment was undertaken on Rudakubana, then 17, a week before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/30/people-in-critical-condition-southport-attack-stabbings\">attack</a> in July last year. Its findings have not been disclosed.</p> <p>It came as Rudakubana’s brother, Dion Rudakubana, made his first public comments on the mass stabbing as he spoke of “the most immense pain, anguish and grief” of the victims.</p> <p>In a written statement, he told the inquiry his younger brother had become “progressively more isolated” after being expelled from school aged 13 in October 2019.</p> <p>He asked the inquiry chair, the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, to explore “whether more could have been done” by social services and other agencies to prevent the murders.</p> <p>A barrister for Dion Rudakubana said: “Dion wholeheartedly supports the inquiry’s aim to identify lessons which will minimise the prospect of such harm being caused in the future.”<strong> </strong></p> <p>The inquiry at Liverpool town hall is examining how such a troubled teenager with a known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/20/axel-rudakubana-a-ticking-timebomb-who-murdered-three-girls-in-southport\">obsession with knives</a> and extreme violence – who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/25/axel-rudakubana-from-unassuming-schoolboy-to-notorious-southport-killer\">referred three times</a> to the counter-radicalisation scheme Prevent – was able to carry out what Fulford called “one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history”.</p> <p>At the time of the attack, Dion Rudakubana was studying mathematics at the University of Warwick, where he helped lead its opera and brass societies.</p> <p>In his statement, Dion Rudakubana said he had “limited interaction” with his younger brother in the years before the mass stabbing owing to his studies and because he is a wheelchair user.</p> <p>His lawyers said Axel Rudakubana’s expulsion from school aged 13 for carrying a knife and attacking a student “plays an important part in [him] becoming progressively more isolated from his friends and family”.</p> <p>The teenager and his family had been receiving support from child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) since February 2021, when Axel Rudakubana was diagnosed as autistic, the inquiry was told. However, he was never diagnosed with a mental health illness, beyond anxiety, in the years before the attack despite the concerns of multiple specialists.</p> <p>The inquiry was told that mental health professionals carried out a risk assessment of Rudakubana on 23 July last year, six days before the killings, when he was formally discharged from Camhs. The findings of that assessment – the third in four years – have not been disclosed.</p> <p>A chronology of Rudakubana’s engagement with Camhs, published on Wednesday, revealed that he in effect stopped cooperating with specialists in 2022, when he was 16.</p> <p>It also emerged on Wednesday that Rudakubana’s teachers raised safeguarding concerns three times about comments he made about the Holocaust and Jewish people in early 2022, aged 15. These were not referred to Prevent because the school, Acorns pupil referral unit in Ormskirk, Lancashire, had already referred him twice to the programme in the previous year, with neither time resulting in further action.</p> <p>Specialists raised concerns about Rudakubana’s parents, who, the inquiry was told, played a “consistently unhelpful role” in his involvement with mental health services.</p> <p>Psychiatrists were “perturbed” by the conduct and behaviour of the teenager’s father, Alphonse, during one consultation in 2022, according to a witness statement published by the inquiry. There was a “real concern” among professionals at this meeting that Axel Rudakubana had lost a significant amount of weight, and about a “lack of parental supervision and monitoring”.</p> <p>Days after Rudakubana turned 15, in August 2021, Camhs reported that he had disclosed “physical aggression and emotional abuse at home”, according to a Lancashire county council witness statement.</p> <p>A social worker reported “tension with the father” and said Rudakubana poured milk on his parents’ bed during a meeting of the social worker and the family that month. No recent violence between Rudakubana and his father had been reported, the statement added.</p> <p>Lancashire county council, the authority that had overall responsibility for Rudakubana’s welfare, said it had identified failings in its handling of the teenager, including several communication breakdowns between agencies. </p> <p>These included after an incident in March 2022 when Rudakubana told police he wanted to kill someone and had made poison after he was found on a bus with a knife having been reported missing by his family.</p> <p>Despite the seriousness of the incident, the teenager’s family support worker was not informed about it. The council said this was a “missed opportunity” to escalate his interest in knives, coming two and a half years after he had been expelled. His family had started hiding the knives at home.<strong> </strong> </p> <p>The inquiry is due to conclude in November and a report to the government is expected in the following months.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A research paper says people are more likely to believe you if you use long words when asking for forgiveness. I prefer to keep it simple</p>",
    "content": "<p>A bloke in a service station once said something really horrible to me. But he swiftly followed it up with one of the most sincere apologies I’ve ever been on the end of. This was at Hopwood Park services on the M42, years ago. I’d just pulled up at the pump. Clocking me, he knocked on the passenger window, and when I opened it he stuck his head in and said something vile. It could have been classed as banter, I suppose, but it was still vile. My two young children were in the back, all wide-eyed in bafflement. Upset more than angry, I got out, filled up and went to pay, only to find him waiting by the car when I returned. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, “I’m sorry mate. I didn’t know you had your kids in the car. I apologise for that.” There was something about the last four words which made the difference, somehow adding just the right amount of emphasis.</p> <p>I wasn’t particularly pleased to have such a memory stirred this week when I read about a research paper, <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/research-digest/harder-words-more-sincere-sorry\">published by the British Psychological Society</a>, on how the length of the words you use when you make an apology are important in conveying your sincerity. Apologies always fascinate me because, as far as I can see, without contrition on one side and forgiveness on the other, we’re all doomed.</p> <p>At middle school I had a science teacher who talked about the concept of decay. He said if leaves didn’t decay, we’d be up to our armpits in them. I feel the same about apologies – if they’re not made and accepted, we’ll all be up to our armpits in bad stuff. Accordingly, I’m one of those people whose anger and disappointment about something somebody has said or done will usually disappear the moment somebody says sorry. I don’t know whether this makes me a nice person, or rather shallow. Conversely, if I’m the one doing the apologising, and the apology isn’t accepted, I get very angry and disappointed indeed, which isn’t really cricket either.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/29/learning-how-to-apologise-well-best-way-to-say-sorry\">How sorry are you? Why learning to apologise well could save your relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study, which looked at written rather than verbal sorries, concludes that people who use longer words in their apologies are more likely to communicate sincerity. So, saying you’re “genuinely” sorry is better than “really” sorry. Apparently the “greater production effort” involved in delivering those two extra syllables does make a slight difference. By this measure, the French are way ahead of us. They really do put their backs into their apologies. When the French for a simple “I am sorry” is something as dramatic and rather beautiful as “Je suis désolé”, you wonder where they go from there. What do you say if you feel more than merely desolate about whatever you’re saying sorry for? A friend of mine in Paris says he’d go for “Je vous prie d’accepter mes excuses les plus sincères”, meaning, “I beg you to accept my most sincere apologies”. Now that’s what I call a production effort. OK, whatever, chill out, je vous pardonne, no problem.</p> <p>Be it in person or on the page, for me less is more. Just “sorry” will do. “I am sorry”, if you must. And OK, if you’ve really done me over you can throw in a very, a genuinely, or even an abjectly. But any more than that and I’ll start to suspect you have wronged me more badly than I realised.</p> <p>I should say that, as with most academic papers, much of the language in which this one is written is quite beyond me. For example, something called iconicity keeps coming up. There are 290,000 words defined in my Chambers dictionary, and iconicity isn’t one of them. But I pressed on regardless and hope I’ve got the gist of it over correctly. If I haven’t, perhaps Shiri Lev-Ari, cognitive psychologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, could get in touch so I can apologise to her at whatever length she desires.</p> <p>• Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist</p>",

On Tuesday, a UN human rights commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry\">published a report</a> concluding that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza.</p> \n<p>The coast road leading south from Gaza City has been packed with families trying to flee the offensive.

The UN estimate is 238,000, including about 50,000 in the last 48 hours.</p> \n<p>The United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where many are already experiencing famine, after Israel closed the only crossing there last week.</p> \n<p>“There are grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion in a matter of days as there are now no direct aid entry points into northern Gaza and resupply from south to north is increasingly challenging due to mounting road congestion and insecurity,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28ac1985-4a79-4700-a70f-acb8fdeb47c1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pWUMh2kx6qE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Contrary to Israeli claims, none of the Palestinians interviewed by the Guardian in recent weeks have said they came under pressure from Hamas to stay in the city.

Well I certainly was. The levels of threatening hate and violence should be a wake-up call, not just for government ministers but for all of us. Stand Up to Racism has done its best to mobilise people to tackle this threat, but it’s clear that we have to find a new way forward to reinforce this work. I am urging people in all civil society organisations to start talking about the situation and in each sector to start talking to each other.</p> <p>I believe there is a fairly widespread understanding of the&nbsp;causes of the views and activities that the far right are exploiting. After Saturday, perhaps there is now a greater understanding of the urgency of the situation. Leading bodies and individuals in each sector of our society should take the initiative in convening urgent discussions of the role they can play in bringing our community together.</p> <p>As the discussions develop, we will see what ideas different sectors of civil society have about what organisational form will be best to reinforce the work of Stand Up to Racism. It may be a series of coalitions that network and reinforce each other’s interventions.</p> <p>Different groups and sectors will have very specific contributions to make and will have their own views on what national networking they would be most comfortable with. I can only stress the dangerous urgency of the current situation.<br><strong>John McDonnell MP</strong><br><em>Independent, Hayes and Harlington</em></p> <p>• I was at the counter-protest at the weekend. I saw first-hand who the crowd attending the far right protest was made up of. It was not people who had boiling-over anger or who were expressing legitimate concerns about immigration. It was pure, gleeful racism. Drunk, laughing and jeering, then belligerent and violent, hurling verbal abuse, smoke grenades and the occasional Nazi salute at anyone who dared stand up to them – no matter that we were outnumbered 20 to one.</p> <p>Anyone who went to that event wanting to express legitimate concerns about immigration should not be surprised to be labelled a racist when keeping company with racists and listening to racist speeches from known racists. Luckily, 100,000 is still only 0.14% of the population. So, everyone else – it’s up to us to firmly say that whatever else happens, we will not legitimise bullying, bigotry and fascism on our streets.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• I understand and agree with Diane Abbott (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/diane-abbott-tommy-robinson-london-rally-labour\">What I saw at Saturday’s rally was racism, pure and simple. Labour won’t tackle it until we can call it what it is, 14 September</a>), and would even say that racism is probably beyond “bubbling up”. Day to day, I am subject to overt and unashamed racism in casual conversation and see people I know and have counted as friends expressing open support for, and sharing content by extreme racists.</p> <p>Earlier this year I had to deal with the school after my mixed-race daughter was racially abused in class – repeatedly called an “illegal immigrant” and asked “if you cut yourself, will curry come out?”.</p> <p>The time has come for our leaders to call this out, show some backbone and meet the moment.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong><br></p> <p>• Diane Abbott is right to warn of the dangers in ignoring racism at events like Tommy Robinson’s rally. But we also need to rebuild the community spaces where people can meet, talk and find common ground. The loss of libraries, youth clubs, community centres and pubs has left many without places for face-to-face connection. In their absence, people turn to social media, where anger is amplified and exploited. Too often, the only remaining gathering points are closed, single-use spaces, whether faith buildings or private venues, which can deepen separation.</p> <p>I think we should invest in community assemblies. Open up churches, mosques, temples and local halls to everyone – without a hire fee. This should be a national priority. I know first-hand that restoring peace may not suit a political climate that thrives on polarisation, but it will be our biggest downfall if we don’t listen to the grassroots. Rebuilding our “public square” is about restoring the habit of listening to one another as neighbours, and recognising that we have more in common than those who profit from our division.<br><strong>Shanell Johnson </strong><br><em>Independent</em><em> councillor, London&nbsp;borough of Redbridge</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>‘Sometimes, less really is more,’ says chef as Michelin-starred restaurant offers Mindful Experience option</p>",
    "content": "<p>When gazing at the bill after a Michelin-starred meal, the average diner’s first thought is not usually: “I wish I’d got less food for that.”</p> <p>But Heston Blumenthal has come up with a new menu catering to just that sentiment, tailored to reflect a growing demand for smaller portions, driven by weight-loss drugs.</p> <p>The restaurateur and TV chef says his alternative selection of tasting courses at the Fat Duck will provide the same flavour and theatre for less-hungry guests – including those taking appetite-suppressing drugs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/weight-loss-drugs-altering-views-how-body-brain-work\">such as Wegovy and Mounjaro</a> – but in reduced quantities.</p> <p>When booking at the world-famous restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, diners can choose the Mindful Experience, which offers all the same creations as the usual menu, the Journey. These include the Nitro-Poached Aperitif, a frozen cocktail puff made with liquid nitrogen, and the Crab and Passionfruit 99′, which reimagines a seaside ice-cream cone.</p> <p>However, portion sizes are reduced by about 20%-30% per dish, and in some cases by up to 50%, while the price is £75 a head cheaper at £275.</p> <p>The offering reflects a rush to accommodate changing tastes as other GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/12/microdosing-weight-loss-jabs-off-label-glp-1-mountjaro\">become more common in the UK</a> as treatments for obesity.</p> <p>Blumenthal has himself been prescribed Mounjaro to help manage weight gained as a side-effect of his medication for type 1 bipolar disorder. “What struck me was the feeling of not being hungry,” he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>“I still wanted to eat, but I didn’t feel that drive. It made me think – this is going to kill the restaurant industry, because if people aren’t eating as much, restaurants won’t be as enticing. I’m not sure what will happen to supermarkets either.</p> <p>“I don’t think this change is bad for health. It could actually be very good for people. But it will affect alcohol, wine, food consumption, even supermarkets. I’ve even heard airlines could save money on fuel. This is only going to escalate in the next couple of months, and already millions of people are on these drugs.”</p>    <p>According to the industry publication Food Manufacture, 37% of UK consumers now cite weight loss as their top health priority. Research presented at a UKHospitality seminar earlier this year showed that 7% of UK adults, about 3.6 million people, used these drugs.</p> <p>Businesses whose models have been upended include Weight Watchers, which has emerged from bankruptcy protection in the US after amassing more than $1.4bn (£1bn) of debt and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/22/weightwatchers-scraps-business-model-to-team-up-with-anti-obesity-drugs-provider\">is now recommending GLP-1 jabs alongside its usual lifestyle-change advice</a>.</p> <p>The wider food industry is also bracing for change, though the effects could be gradual. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that the consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035.</p> <p>However, some in the industry have said they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/06/will-weight-loss-drugs-kill-the-fast-food-business\">do not anticipate a big impact on sales</a> as take-up of the drugs could remain relatively low. Other food manufacturers are already making changes: Nestlé, for instance, is developing higher-protein and nutrient-dense products to meet the needs of consumers eating less overall.</p> <p>The consumer champion Martin Newman says: “We’re already seeing other hospitality businesses pivot. In the US, brands like Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Panera have expanded lighter, protein-rich menu ranges designed for people eating less … Here in the UK, restaurant groups are widening ‘lighter choice’ menus, and delivery platforms like Deliveroo are making calories and protein far more visible.</p> <p>“Weight-loss drugs are no longer niche … It’s a lifestyle change and not a fad. Therefore, eating out must adapt.”</p> <p>Newman says some operators may worry about “spend per head going down” with smaller portions, but that “misses the bigger picture”. He added: “If you can align eating out with people’s health goals, you’ll increase frequency and protect loyalty.”</p> <p>Blumenthal, who has built a career on innovation and exploration of the science of food, says his new menu reflects these shifts. “Millions of people are eating much less food, drinking less, losing interest in restaurants, losing interest even in food,” the chef says. “For more than a decade I’ve been saying that mindful eating is one of the keys to happiness and mental health.”</p> <p>Blumenthal adds that mindful eating can be applied beyond fine dining, even to simple meals. But in the case of the Fat Duck, the new menu is designed specifically to meet shifting appetites. “Sometimes, less really is more.”</p> <p>Trish Caddy, of the analysts Mintel, argues that while weight-loss drugs are beginning to affect dining out in the UK, their impact remains limited. “These drugs are expensive and highly regulated, restricting their use typically to wealthier consumers. Heston Blumenthal’s smaller-portion menu seems tailored to this group, highlighting a shift toward health-conscious dining rather than a mass-market change.”</p> <p>The Fat Duck says the price of both menus reflects the labour-intensive nature of service at the restaurant, which operates with almost as many chefs and waiters as guests during a sitting.</p> <p>The restaurant is celebrating its 30th anniversary, three decades after opening on 16 August 1995. Originally a brasserie, it soon became famous for its experimental molecular gastronomy, producing dishes such as snail porridge and nitro-scrambled bacon-and-egg ice-cream. The restaurant rose rapidly through the Michelin ranks, gaining three stars by 2004, and in the following year was named the world’s best restaurant, the only British venue to ever take the top spot.</p> <p>“Appetite suppressants are here in significant numbers,” Blumenthal says. “The way we eat is changing. Restaurants will have to change with it.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Whether it’s a favourite bar, biscuit or indulgent hot drink, feeding a chocolate habit costs more than it used to.</p> <p>The price of the chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot.</p> <p>Although other price moves meant overall UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\">was unchanged at 3.8%</a> last month, chocolate was a big riser. Alongside hikes for beef, butter and coffee, it helped propel food price inflation back over 5% for the first time in 18 months.</p> <p>At £30 a go, the luxury 1kg jars of giant chocolate buttons sold by gifting brand Cocoba were a casualty of a soaring cocoa price, explains the company’s founder Darren Litton.</p> <p>With cocoa prices more than doubling over the past two years as a result of poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, even something aimed at gift buyers was being priced off the shelf.</p> <p>“We delisted them for a while because we couldn’t even sell them at £40 with the price of everything involved,” Litton says.</p> <p>Cocoa now commands about $7,800 (£5,700) per tonne on international commodities markets from below $3,500 (£2,600) two years ago. The price peaked at more than $12,000 (£8,800) at the end of 2024.</p> <p>The easing price means Cocoba is bringing the jars of giant buttons back for Christmas, but even at £40 Litton says it’s a challenge to make the numbers add up.</p> <p>“The cocoa price is still at a very, very high level but seems to be settling down a bit,” he adds. “We make everything at our factory in Kent. We’ve had to increase prices and invest in equipment to improve efficiency.”</p> <p>Cocoba is a minnow in a market dominated by big names such as Nestlé and Mars but surging ingredient costs have hurt them too. Mondelēz, which owns Cadbury, expects annual profits to fall 10% owing to higher cocoa prices.</p> <p>The squeeze has triggered numerous rounds of shrinkflation, with the Guardian recently revealing that tubs of Quality Street and Celebrations and even some Toblerone bars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/shrinkflation-bites-as-boxes-of-quality-street-and-celebrations-lose-weight\">have shrunk</a> ahead of Christmas.</p> <p>Not much gets past cash-strapped shoppers, who have also raised eyebrows on discovering a KitKat nine-pack is now an eight-pack, and a multipack of Freddos contains four not five chocolates.</p> <p>Alex Lawrence, a retail expert at data company Circana, says higher ingredient costs are being passed on to the consumer. “If you look at the average price per kg for chocolate confectionery it’s up 27% over the last two years, and 12% in the last year.”</p> <p>Britons spent £5.9bn on chocolate in stores in the year to 9 August. Although that figure was up 10%, they actually physically took home less in their baskets.</p> <p>“The quantity we are buying is down 2% year-on-year,” says Lawrence. “People are definitely pulling back in terms of their consumption.”</p> <p>Shop price data compiled for the Guardian reveals the extent of increases over the past two years, with favourites such as Cadbury Dairy Milk or Galaxy costing about 30% more than in 2023.</p> <p>A 110g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk now costs £1.84 on average, which works out at 42p more than in 2023, according to the price analysts Assosia. The equivalent Galaxy bar has gone up by the same amount to £1.79. The data is based on the average pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.</p> <p>The big companies all say the same thing when asked about pack size reductions and price increases. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Mondelēz told the Guardian it continued to experience “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they had done previously.</p> <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p> <p>On the high street, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk\">upmarket Knoops chain</a> sells posh hot chocolates graded by cocoa percentage, with prices starting at £4 for a drink made with a 28% single-origin Colombian chocolate.</p>    <p>“It’s been a wild ride for cocoa prices,” says company founder Jens Knoop. It is not just cocoa, he adds that the chain’s matcha bill increased 53% this month.</p> <p>“While there have been increases in our per kilo chocolate price … we have only passed on a small percentage of that to our customers in their chocolate drinks,” says Knoop.</p> <p>But while you might treat yourself to Knoops’ most expensive brew – a limited edition 68% single-origin Madagascan chocolate costing £7.90 – on a day out, in the supermarket consumers balk at tubs of instant hot chocolate costing north of a fiver.</p> <p>The price of a 220g jar of Options is up 20% over two years at £5.40, according to Assosia, prompting shoppers to take to supermarket websites to complain. “This is a good product,” writes one. “It used to be reasonably priced £3-£4 Now it is £5.40!!!!”</p> <p>In a similar vein, at £4.50 a 500g tub of Cadbury hot chocolate costs a fifth more than it did in 2023.</p> <p>Shoppers also complain that other price changes take the biscuit. At £2.25, a 266g pack of McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives costs 35p more than two years ago. Meanwhile a 130g pack of Fox’s milk chocolatey rounds is now £2.30. The same pack cost £1.87 two years ago.</p> <p>The increases are also notable on supermarket own-label chocolate digestives – which provide a cheaper alternative to the big brands – with a 300g pack now £1.12, up from 85p two years ago.</p> <p>Food and drink inflation could hit 5.7% by the end of year, up from August’s reading of 5.1%, according to the Food and Drink Federation.</p> <p>Karen Betts, the trade body’s chief executive, says rising food prices were previously down to energy and commodity shocks, but now government policies – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/reeves-defends-40bn-tax-increase-in-autumn-budget-as-businesses-prepare-for-nics-hike\">April’s increase in employers’ national insurance contributions</a> – were a driver.</p> <p>“The costs are such that companies can no longer absorb them and are having to pass at least some of them on to consumers.”</p>    <p>Needless to say it’s a difficult environment for small companies such as Temprd, which makes “properly chunky” chocolate bars, in flavours such as lemon and blueberry cheesecake.</p> <p>When Rob Anthony started the Essex company with his brother five years ago he was aware that its premium bars looked expensive compared to “run of the mill” chocolate. “At that time our bars were probably around £3 per 100g. Now they are £4.50.</p> <p>“We had to make two jumps, from £3 to £3.75 and then to £4.50, so two price rises in the last four years,” he says, but is hopeful the worst is over.</p> <p>“There might be a [cocoa] surplus this year, because demand has fallen, and production has been quite good. We’re fairly confident we can survive through from now to next Easter without having to put our prices up.”</p> <p>As the brands sold in supermarkets become more expensive Anthony suggests people are becoming more circumspect.</p> <p>“We haven’t changed the recipe,” he says. “We haven’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">skimpflated</a> our product or changed the size. We just put the price up to cope with price increases. People are willing to spend more less often to buy a luxury product … they feel they’re getting better value for money.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-keir-starmer-us-president-britain",
    "description": "<p>The choice for governments around the world is clear: engage, or fall beneath the US president’s wheel. For now, Britain must do the former</p>",
    "content": "<p>Has any visiting leader ever seen so little of Britain or the British as Donald Trump is doing this week? The absurdly unrepresentative version of the country offered up to the US president on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-king-charles-windsor-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-keir-starmer\">second state visit</a> on Wednesday was a Windsor parody, a Potemkin version of this country, glistening with protocol and polish, amid a lavish reenactment of the British monarchy’s invented traditions. Just about the only thing that was authentic was the rain.</p> <p>But here’s the unalterable and underlying thing. None of that really matters. What matters is that Trump is the most powerful leader in the world. Despite all the Trumpian shocks, the US and Britain remain allies. Business can and should be done between them. So the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/trump-uk-analysis-normal-rules-of-state-visits-do-not-apply\">opportunity for face-time with Trump</a>, in circumstances designed to soften him up with flattery and engage him over this country’s own priorities, is to be seized. Not to do this would be perverse.</p> <p>No, it is not ideal. The era of shared values is ebbing fast. Keir Starmer did not need to play the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-trump-visit-relations\">state visit card so soon</a> or so generously. He should have made Trump wait for the invitation, extracting a higher price for it, and offering hints that it might be offered in return for the right deal. But Starmer is not alone in struggling to read a president who is both unserious and utterly serious at the same time. All nations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/trump-qatar-india-israel-middle-east-saudi-uae-modi-nato\">still trying to work out how to respond</a>.</p> <p>The justification for inviting him for a second state visit is thus pure <em>raison d’état –</em> a reward for bad behaviour that is nevertheless in the British national interest. This may not be personally agreeable to some of those taking part, or to millions of others at home or on the streets. It may even not be very moral. Many – perhaps from the king downwards – will bite their tongues over these two distasteful days. All the same, it is necessary work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-america-donald-trump-britain\">Keir Starmer is betting everything on an America that doesn’t exist any more | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also even more necessary in Trump’s second term than it was in the first. Trump’s victory in 2024 was more emphatic than in 2016 and his preparation for his White House return was far more thorough. From day one, his agenda, at home and abroad, has been more radical, more audacious, and in many respects is also proving more successful. Let others denounce this. Governments must engage or fall beneath his wheel.</p> <p>Three things will matter in particular when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-agenda-key-takeaways\">Trump meets Starmer on Thursday</a> for the political half of the visit: trade, the Middle East and Ukraine. Views will differ on the top priority. The major <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-us-agree-42-billion-tech-pact-mark-trumps-visit-2025-09-16/\">technological investment</a> that Peter Mandelson nurtured in his months as ambassador in Washington seems already locked in, a material legacy of a job done well, if briefly. On the Middle East, meanwhile, the immediate goal must be to prevent Trump exploding when Britain and others recognise Palestine next week.</p> <p>So <em>raison d’état</em> says that pressure on Trump over Ukraine needs to come first. Russia’s threat to Europe is existential. Long term, the solution to that is in Europe’s own hands. The idea that the US should continue to be primarily responsible for Europe’s security 80 years after the second world war is now barely credible. But Starmer still needs to do whatever he can to press Trump to arm Ukraine more now. If nothing else, the prime minister should stress the shocking inconsistency between the administration’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/trump-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-russia-if-nato-nations-stop-buying-its-oil\">tough sanctions on China and India</a> for buying Russian gas while not going after Russia itself on the battlefield.</p> <p>Many will recoil from the engagement with Trump. Those of us who are not government ministers or diplomats have the luxury of being able to do so. That’s not an option for Starmer. Since it is in the national interest to try to influence Trump, it is part of Starmer’s duty to try. He clearly accepts that it is part of his job. He is right. If Starmer visits China in the coming weeks, he will be right about that part of it, too.</p> <p>There are, of course, multiple reasons why Trump’s state visit can and should be criticised. The principal reason is that Trump is doing harm – a lot of it. So his visit is not an occasion for celebration but for damage limitation. That is the unspoken reason why it is taking place behind steel walls and closed doors. But that does not invalidate it. A realist might even say it makes the visit more necessary rather than less.</p> <p>The tightly controlled programme and the brevity of Trump’s stay are a recognition of the obvious risks and possible provocations. A decade ago, China’s paramount leader, Xi Jinping, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/chinese-president-begins-uk-state-visit-show-strength-xi-jinping-speech-parliament-queen\">granted the full gilded coach treatment</a> along the Mall – not to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/23/chinese-president-xi-jinping-manchester-visit-northern-powerhouse-status\">a trip to Manchester</a> as well. Back in 1978, even the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, a man with blood on his hands, <a href=\"https://wspartners.bbc.com/episode/w3ct1wyy\">rode through London with the royals</a> in an open-topped coach. No such treatment for Trump this time.</p> <p>It may all go off the rails, perhaps at Thursday’s Chequers press conference, where journalists will try their best to provoke Trump. Even if that does happen, though, the visit will still have been worthwhile. At best, it may produce the trade and tech agreements worked on by Mandelson, and perhaps help generate greater US robustness towards Russia and Israel. Even at worst, it will be another reminder to Britain and its more dependable allies that a new version of the international economic and security order is still salvageable from the damage being done by Trump. The important thing is to keep options open, not to close them off.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Threadneedle Street has cut borrowing costs five times since summer 2024.</p> <p>City economists said there were some signs that inflationary pressures were beginning to abate.

His victory restored a legislative tie in the state house, with each party controlling 67 seats.</p> <p>“I have never lost sight of the situation that brought us to this moment, and I will work hard every day to carry forward Speaker Melissa Hortman’s legacy,” Lee said in a statement on Tuesday night.</p> <p>The race had attracted national attention, with Democrats celebrating the win as the latest in a string of special election victories.</p> <p>“Across Minnesota, our hearts are still broken by the horrific assassination that stole Melissa and her husband Mark,” the Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, who formerly chaired the Minnesota state party and was a close friend of Hortman’s, said in a statement. “Political violence is a scourge that has taken far too many lives. Enough is enough. It must end now. And in every case, each of us has a responsibility to condemn and reject political violence wherever it rears its head.”</p> <p>The Minnesota election came amid heightened alarm in the US over political violence, and comes just days after the far-right activist Charlie Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was shot and killed</a> during an event at Utah Valley University.</p> <p>Authorities say that the man accused of killing the Hortmans, 58-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-suspect-legislator-homes\">Vance Boelter</a>, had a list of targets which included Democratic lawmakers and abortion rights advocates, and that he traveled to two other legislators’ homes that evening – with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-suspect-legislator-homes\">plans to assassinate them</a>.</p> <p>In an interview with the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-special-election-political-violence-0a3a4af74272635ae725a09f1438239f\">Associated Press </a>over the weekend, Bittner said that she noticed early in her campaign that residents in the area where Hortman was killed seemed afraid to open their doors.</p> <p>“We are in very, very scary times, and we definitely need to get out of this trajectory that we’re on here,” Bittner said.</p> <p>Bittner said that the rise in political violence briefly made her question running for office, but that she ultimately decided: “We can’t cower.”</p> <p>“We have to move forward as a country,” she added. “We have to embrace the system that we have of representative government, and we have to just do it, you know? …There’s no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear.”</p> <p>Lee told the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/voters-to-choose-dfler-tuesday-in-race-to-fill-melissa-hortmans-house-seat/601453101\">Minnesota Star Tribune </a>in August that one of his motivations for running was to “take up” Hortman’s “legacy of leadership” and said that Hortman “paved pathways for a lot of us”.</p> <p>Lee told the AP that Hortman was a neighbor he often saw walking her dog, and that she had offered him guidance when he ran for city council.</p> <p>“I can’t think of a better way to honor her than to go to the capitol and do my best in the seat,” Lee said.</p> <p>Lee acknowledged the heightened tensions following Kirk’s killing, describing the current political climate as a “charged atmosphere”.</p> <p>“So I want to do what I can to really bring that down,” he said, including supporting a ban on automatic and semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p> <p>Lee said that he keeps a shotgun himself for home defense but that assault-style rifles “are weapons of war that really we don’t need on our streets”.</p> <p>Boelter <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-lawmakers-killed-shot-vance-boelter-moriarty-9e1eb92fbd22a5bd4e504404b5b3dcc8\">faces federal and state</a> murder charges in the Hortmans’ deaths, as well as attempted murder and other charges in the shooting of another Democratic Minnesota lawmaker, state senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, who both survived.</p> <p>Boelter was indicted in July on multiple federal and state charges, including murder, attempted murder, and firearms violations.

    "description": "<p><strong>Frank Coffield </strong>offers<strong> </strong>an alternative way forward. Plus a letter from <strong>Chris Dunne</strong></p>",
    "content": "<p>Ofsted is incapable of reforming itself. It has rejected the advice calling for radical change (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/09/ofsted-press-ahead-inspection-regime-despite-opposition\">Ofsted to press ahead with new inspection regime despite opposition, 9 September</a>). <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68b9a6b8b0a373a01819fe4b/Schools_inspection_toolkit.pdf\">The new toolkit</a> runs to 80 pages and lists 314 standards over seven areas<strong> </strong>that institutions will be judged on. It’s like deciding to repaint the Titanic after it’s hit the iceberg.</p> <p>Anger is mounting about the opportunity being lost to create a humane and effective system of inspection. If the government accepts Ofsted’s gargantuan framework, the coming months will be consumed by conflict with the professionals.</p> <p>There’s an alternative way forward. Ministers should set up a commission of teachers’ leaders, experienced inspectors and experts in inspection to produce a different model. It would support teachers to improve the quality of students’ learning, while dealing firmly, but sensitively, with the weaknesses that undeniably exist.</p> <p>Why not test whatever model the government chooses by running alongside it a pilot of the best ideas on inspection, culled from national and international research? The pilot could take place in an area chosen to be as representative as possible of the country as a whole. Whatever system proved to be the more effective could become the makings of a new evidence-based approach.</p> <p>The opportunity to enact reform comes round seldom. This one must be seized with both hands to end the decades of failure to raise standards. Will the government rise to the occasion and transform inspection for good? Over to you, Bridget Phillipson.<br><strong>Frank Coffield<br></strong><em>Emeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of Education</em></p> <p>• When the secondary school that I led was first inspected by Ofsted in 1997 it involved 16 inspectors spending the best part of a week in school, going everywhere and seeing everything they needed to. The outcome report, though it pulled no punches, was thorough and largely accurate and provided a sound basis for our own development plan. Long before I retired, an inspection involved a mere four inspectors and lasted barely two days, with oral “feedback”, such as it was, being given after lunch on the second day.<br><br>Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector, says Ofsted’s new traffic light report card will give parents the information they deserve and ensure that the work of education professionals is fairly assessed. The sad truth is that, like the one it replaces, this report will be done on the cheap and provide the very flimsiest of evidence on which parents or professionals could base any worthwhile judgments. Even worse, it will continue to be used punitively in judging headteachers and their staff and do nothing to relieve the unrealistic pressures, which see nearly a third of newly qualified teachers <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/teaching-workforce-grows-by-just-259-as-recruitment-stalls/\">leave the profession</a> within five years.<br><strong>Chris Dunne</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>Museum says specimens taken are worth €600,000 based on price of gold but have ‘immeasurable heritage value’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Historic gold samples with a street value of €600,000 but priceless to scientists and researchers have been stolen from the French national natural history museum in the latest of a series of museum robberies in France.</p> <p>“This has happened in a critical context for cultural establishments in France, particularly museums,” the Paris museum said. “Several public collections have been the victims of robberies in the past months.”</p> <p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, an apparently well-planned criminal operation targeted the museum’s geology and mineralogy gallery. Cleaning staff detected the break-in later that day and museum teams saw that four to six pieces of gold were missing.</p> <p>The thieves are believed to have used an angle grinder and blowtorch to force their way into the riverside museum that sits on the edge of Paris’s Jardin des Plantes. It is an unprecedented theft from the high-security museum.</p> <p>A museum spokesperson said thieves took “several specimens of native gold from the national collections held by the museum”. The spokesperson added: “While the stolen specimens are valued at around €600,000 based on the price of raw gold, they nevertheless carry an immeasurable heritage value. The museum laments this inestimable loss for research, heritage and for a collection accessible to the public.”</p> <p>Native gold is a metal alloy containing gold and silver in their natural, unrefined form.</p> <p>The museum’s director, Emmanuel Skoulios, told BFMTV: “We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment. It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items. Beyond the material value, for the museum this is above all about pieces in the national collection whose historic, scientific and heritage value is incalculable.”</p>    <p>The museum’s mineralogy gallery remained closed on Wednesday while the organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police led an investigation. Security was increased at the museum and staff were checking the collection for other losses.</p> <p>One of the museum’s treasures, according to its website, is a native gold and quartz sample measuring 9cm by 8.5cm that originated in the Donatia mine in California and was donated by a wealthy French collector.</p> <p>Earlier this month the Adrien-Dubouché National Museum in Limoges, central France, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/04/porcelain-treasures-stolen-from-french-museum-adrien-dubouche-institute-limoges\">broken into</a> and thieves took three objects worth a total of more than €6.5m and classed as “national treasures” in France. They were two 14th- and 15th-century China porcelain plates and an 18th-century China porcelain vase.</p> <p>The mayor of Limoges, Émile Roger Lombertie, told Agence France-Presse on the day the robbery was discovered: “Criminality is increasing, we always have to be one step ahead. All the great museums of the world have had pieces stolen at one time or another. It is seemingly collectors giving orders to established criminal gangs.”</p> <p>Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay Museum in Paris targeting a popular exhibition, Pocket Luxury, which featured small precious objects from the 18th century. Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection.</p> <p>The next day, jewellery valued at several million euros was stolen in an armed robbery at around 4pm at the Hiéron Museum in Saône-et-Loire in central France.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/20/paris-art-theft-picasso-matisse\">most notorious</a> museum heist of recent times occurred at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris in May 2010. Vjeran Tomic, nicknamed Spider-Man, made off with masterpieces by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Amedeo Modigliani valued at more than €100m.</p> <p>The case revealed extraordinary security lapses at the museum, including that motion-detection alarms had been out of order for two months, and three guards failed to spot Tomic, who in 2017 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/20/spider-man-burglar-jailed-musee-dart-moderne-heist-vjeran-tomic-theft-paris\">sentenced</a> to eight years in prison.</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.</em></p>",

    "content": "<p>Police investigating the rape of a British-born Sikh woman in a racially aggravated attack in the West Midlands have made a fresh appeal for public help as they bailed an arrested man.</p> <p>The woman, in her 20s, reported being attacked by two white men while she was on her way to work in Oldbury on the morning of Tuesday 9 September.</p> <p>The perpetrators allegedly told her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out,” as they attacked her between 8am and 8.30am, according to the Sikh Federation (UK).</p> <p>A man in his 30s, who was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape, has been released on bail pending further inquiries, West Midlands police said on Wednesday. Officers are continuing to appeal for information about the incident which police have described as “racially aggravated”.</p> <p>The victim is being supported by officers, the force said, as they trawl hundreds of hours of CCTV and carried out “extensive” forensic inquiries. Detectives are urging anyone who saw two white men in the area to come forward. The first man is reported to have had a shaved head, a heavy build and was wearing gloves and a dark coloured sweatshirt, while the second was wearing a grey top with a silver zip.</p> <p>Chief Superintendent Kim Madill, police commander at Sandwell, said: “We are working closely with key partners and we absolutely understand the concern of local people.</p> <p>“We need the public’s help to bring us information on who has carried out this horrendous attack. I can reassure you that we are doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice on this young woman’s behalf.”</p> <p>A letter in the joint name of more than 450 UK Gurdwaras and Sikh organisations is being sent to Keir Starmer expressing disappointment at the lack of progress with the case.</p> <p>The campaigners say there is an increased threat and, citing a number of recent high-profile racist attacks, call on Starmer “to encourage the new home secretary and new communities secretary to address anti-Sikh hate”.</p> <p>Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Tuesday evening to support the woman. Salman Mirza, one of the organisers, told the Stourbridge News: “We feel there’s been a rise in racism and we want unity because we believe this is a good area. We’ve seen the hotel protests and there’s a lot of division at the moment and we want solidarity.</p> <p>“People are outraged and frightened at what’s happened to this woman – we wanted to get together and get women to speak. There’s a connection between the far right and misogyny.”</p> <p>The woman has released a statement thanking the community for its “love and support”. She said: “I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us.</p> <p>“Through it all, my family has been my rock and my community has stood strong beside me.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Nationwide building society has defended its chair, Kevin Parry, after he became the first boss of a major British lender to publicly engage with Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party.</p> <p>It emerged on Wednesday that Parry, who has been chair of the member-owned building society since 2016, attended a breakfast event earlier this week meant to help companies understand Reform’s approach to business.</p> <p>The breakfast event was hosted by Sanctuary Counsel, a consultancy focused on “building, enhancing and protecting” the reputation of clients, with Parry seated next to Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice.</p> <p>It makes Parry the first senior boss from a UK bank or lender to be publicly seen with the party, which has outlined controversial policies including the mass deportation of asylum seekers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/18/labour-mps-challenge-richard-tice-reform-u-plan-scrap-green-projects\">ripping up green energy contracts</a> and stripping the City watchdog of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/reform-uk-could-strip-city-watchdog-of-power-to-regulate-banking-if-elected\">power to regulate the banking industry</a>.</p> <p>The building society, which is owned by its 17 million members, defended Parry’s attendance – which was first reported by the Financial Times – saying it was part of “routine” engagement with parties across the political spectrum.</p> <p>A Nationwide spokesperson said: “As part of his role, our chairman meets with representatives from across the political spectrum. These engagements are routine and reflect our commitment to constructive dialogue on issues that matter to our members and the wider sector.”</p> <p>Business leaders have been closely watching Reform after its sweeping local election victories this year and as opinion polls suggest it could win hundreds of seats at a general election. But while Reform said it had welcomed hundreds of businesses to its annal conference in Birmingham earlier this month, most groups sent junior staff, with bosses still concerned about being associated with the rightwing party.</p> <p>All of the UK’s “big five” trade bodies – including the CBI, British Chambers of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses – dispatched public affairs executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/booze-bitcoin-businesses-flocking-birmingham-meet-reform-nigel-farage\">to the conference</a>.</p> <p>Heathrow sponsored an airport-style lounge for business delegates and First Group provided double-decker buses for meetings. JCB, the digger-maker owned by Lord Bamford, the billionaire former Conservative donor who is now backing Reform, was also an exhibitor, and other corporate attenders included Airbnb and Japan Tobacco International.</p> <p>TikTok sponsored a drinks reception where Reform councillors and the party’s newest MP, Sarah Pochin, rubbed shoulders with corporate lobbyists over complimentary canapés, pints and cocktails.</p> <p>However, companies are also treating the party with caution. One corporate affairs boss, who stayed away from the Reform conference, told the Guardian at the time: “Everyone feels awkward, no one wants to be called out as being there.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The killing of Charlie Kirk last week sent shock waves through America among both supporters and opponents of his views. Yet until last week, the young rightwing activist was relatively unheard of – by older generations anyway – outside the US. </p> <p>As the ripples and implications of his death continue to spread across the US and beyond, our big story takes a step back. Washington bureau chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a> explains how the young activist rose to prominence and gained a place within Donald Trump’s inner circle, his provocative brand of populism and charisma playing an outsize role in the Republicans’ 2024 election victory. As Steve Bannon, the prominent rightwing commentator, told the Guardian, Kirk’s popularity with young voters “changed the ground game” for Trump and the Maga movement.</p> <p>Kirk’s shooting also returned the focus to the vexed issue of gun control in the US. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a> examines whether a country where weapons violence has become normalised is prepared to ask searching questions of itself. And commentator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\">Jonathan Freedland</a> gives a pessimistic prognosis that a “country born in violence” shows even less inclination under Trump than it may have done in previous administrations to heal the division that is pulling American society apart. <br></p> <p>Thank you for subscribing to the Guardian Weekly – and if you’re a new reader, welcome!

New York passed a similar measure in December.</p> <p>“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”</p> <p>The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two non-profits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.</p> <p>Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.</p> <p>“Let’s be clear: this law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”</p> <p>The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-climate-state-laws-executive-order\">April executive order</a>, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/24/trump-effort-rescind-endangerment-finding-climate-crisis\">Trump effort to ditch greenhouse gas finding ignores ‘clearcut’ science, expert says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.</p> <p>Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel non-profit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.</p> <p>“The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/28/poll-climate-change-lawsuit-oil-industry\">polling</a> shows that 74% of voters, including a majority of Republicans, support making oil and gas companies pay their fair share for climate damages,” he said. “No wonder the Trump administration and their big oil donors see climate superfund laws as such a threat: these are popular, commonsense policies that will help cities, states and families offset the costs of extreme weather and other climate impacts.” </p>",

After dominating the first two days, they slip from 137 for 0 to 295 all out, with Marcus Trescothick thwacking 111 and Graham Thorpe* batting almost four hours for a skilful 64. “A pretty sorry first-innings effort” is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/23/cricket.englandinbangladesh200304\">verdict of Dan Rookwood on the Guardian OBO</a>.</p> <p>Bangladesh finished the day on 12 for 1 in their second innings, a deficit of 80, and England hit the hay with a slippery fourth-innings chase on their mind. (Spoiler alert: England eventually cantered to a target of 164 inside 40 overs to win by seven wickets.)</p> <p>On the same day, a Bajan couple welcomed their first child into the world. Graham and Giselle Bethell christened him Jacob Graham, and they will be among the proudest people on earth today when he captains England in the first T20 international against Malahide.</p> <p>Feeling old? Don’t worry you are. When Bethell was born, Sugababes were top of the hit parade with Hole in the Head, England were a month away from winning the men’s rugby World Cup, Twenty20 cricket was barely four months old and nobody was suffering death by a thousand notifications.</p> <p>At 21 years 329 days, Bethell will demolish the record for England’s youngest-ever captain, set unknowingly by Montague Bowden (23y 144d) in 1888-89. Scheduling a match in Malahide in mid-September comes with certain meteorological risks, but the weather is fine and there’s no danger of a washout. Ireland’s aim is turn Bethell’s big day into a damp squib.</p> <p><strong>The match starts at 1.30pm</strong></p> <p><em>* If you love Thorpey as much as the rest of us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/13/cricket.comment\">this interview with the great Don McRae</a> before that Bangladesh series is a fascinating and poignant read.

    "content": "<p>Late-show hosts recap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s chilly reception in the UK, his corrupt business deals with the UAE and Maga’s fearmongering around the “radical left”.</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2> <p>On Monday night, Trump became the first US president to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/trump-new-york-times-lawsuit\">sue the New York Times</a>, for defamation to the tune of $15bn. “Where does he even come up with this?” wondered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> on Tuesday evening. “These are like numbers my children make up when they’re talking about money.”</p> <p>“I thought he said the New York Times was failing,” he added. “He thinks they have $15bn? How much would he sue for if he thought they were doing well?”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHT7ICvMtlA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>“He won’t win this. The New York Times won’t settle,” Kimmel noted. “Besides how ridiculous it is, this might be one of the funniest legal documents I’ve ever seen. It’s quite a tongue bath.” One page lists Trump’s “hundreds of history-making appearances” including WrestleMania V, All My Children, Ghosts Can’t Do It, Two Weeks Notice, the Miss America pageants and “much more”.</p> <p>“This is quite a resume,” Kimmel deadpanned. “You know he met Melania on 90 Day Fiance.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/16/seth-meyers-trump-russia-poland\">Seth Meyers: ‘Trump clearly has no answer to Putin’s aggression’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, “many in Maga-land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. On Monday, JD Vance, who once called Trump “America’s Hitler”, hosted Kirk’s podcast from the White House and blamed the left, without evidence. Said Vance: “While our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.”</p> <p>“And by ‘statistical fact’, he means ‘complete bullshit’,” Kimmel corrected. In fact, the Department of Justice removed from its website a study finding that violence from far-right groups is the greatest source of domestic terror and extremist violence in the US. “Here’s a question JD Vance might be able to answer: who wanted to hang the guy who was vice president before you?” Kimmel said. “Was that the liberal left? Or the toothless army who stormed the Capitol on January 6.”</p> <p>“The president and his henchmen are doing their best to fan the flames, so they can I guess attack people on the dangerous left,” Kimmel added, noting the incongruence with the right’s former vision of so-called “snowflake” liberals. “Which is it?” he wondered. “Are they a bunch of sissy pickleball players because they’re too scared to get hit by tennis balls? Or are they a well-organized army of commandos? Because they can’t be both.”</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZJX_Pejev4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZJX_Pejev4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On the Late Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">Stephen Colbert</a> celebrated the show’s first Emmy win for outstanding variety talk series with their trophy on stage. “Man, I’m telling you, we should’ve gotten cancelled years ago,” he joked.</p> <p>“This award belongs to all 200 of the incredibly hardworking people who make this show,” he said. “First and foremost, the writers of this show” as well as the “stage crew, production staff, talent, segment editors, the band, control room, props, graphics, research, footage, digital, accounting, legal, wardrobe, makeup, security, maintenance, assistants and interns”.</p> <p>“And, of course, the audience department who let in all of you gorgeous people every night,” he added. “You are the ones who ultimately make this show possible. So this belongs to you, but I’m going to keep it.”</p> <p>“Speaking of Emmys, Donald Trump doesn’t have one,” he continued. “Also, right now, he’s out of the country, making his second state visit to the UK. But for a state visit, Trump is going to be keeping it surprisingly low profile.” The President will stay behind closed doors at Windsor Castle, far from massive planned protests and without delivering a traditional address to potential critics in Parliament. Still, protesters managed to unfurl a giant banner on the castle lawn with an old picture of Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>“What are they going to do with it after Trump’s state visit?” Colbert wondered. “‘Children, we have a donation of a very unfortunate parachute for today’s gym class.’”</p> <p>While he’s there, Trump will be treated to an opulent banquet at Windsor Castle and a carriage ride through the grounds. “Oh, the pageantry!” Colbert joked. “He’s just like Cinderella, but good luck slipping the glass slipper on those cankles.”</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HmKsN1YsmQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3HmKsN1YsmQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers\">Seth Meyers</a> recapped a New York Times investigation into how the Trump family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-cryptocurrency\">made $2bn in cryptocurrency deals</a> with the UAE, in exchange for giving the Emirati government access to advanced AI chips. “Who am I to say that these two things are connected?” Meyers joked. “It’s totally possible that Donald Trump Sr was negotiating the chips deal while Donald Trump Jr was negotiating the crypto deal, and they had no idea until it was time to sign the contract, and then they both showed up at the same restaurant at the same time and said ‘Don, what are you doing here?’”</p> <p>“This is obviously, ludicrously corrupt,” he said. When a reporter asked Trump on Tuesday about his business deals, Trump pivoted to “what has recently become his favorite topic”: the new White House ballroom, which Trump said “will knock your socks off”.</p> <p>“Stop talking about the fucking ballroom!” Meyers begged. “No one gives a shit about the ballroom. Prices are skyrocketing and our freedoms are disappearing all around us, and you’re going on about a ballroom like a fop from Dangerous Liaisons.”</p> <p>“You think the farmers in Iowa who voted for you are sitting down for coffee at their local diners saying, ‘well, the tariffs are killing my business, but at least the White House will finally have a place to hold fancy proms?’”</p> <p>Meyers also mocked Trump for threatening the Australian reporter who asked about the UAE deals with reporting on him to the Australian prime minister during their next visit.</p> <p>“What a fucking tattletale,” Meyers laughed. “Also you think you’re going to scare an Australian? They live in a country that’s mostly an unlivable desert, they have spiders the size of tennis rackets, but he’s shaking in his boots because you’re going to tell on him?”</p> <p>Meyers did point out, however, that Trump’s approval rating is at an all-time low. “It might feel like he’s just getting away with all this outlandish corruption and the erosion of our rights while Democrats and the media acquiesce, but most Americans are firmly opposed to this stuff,” he said. “They’re counting down the days until something changes.”</p>",

Here, the Guardian examines the significance of the court’s decision and what it means for the removal scheme.</p>  <h2>Why did the judge block the deportation?</h2>  <p>Mr Justice Sheldon halted the removal after a decision came through during the court hearing that the 25-year-old Eritrean’s claims to be a victim of trafficking required further investigation. </p> <p>The national referral mechanism, which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking, invited the man to make further representations. </p> <p>“It seems there is a serious issue to be tried with respect of the trafficking claim and whether or not the secretary of state has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,” said Sheldon. “If there is a reasonable suspicion he has been trafficked that would amount to a statutory bar for removal, at least for a short period of time.” </p> <h2>Does this mean the whole scheme is doomed? </h2>  <p>Comparisons are already being made with the previous government’s scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda\">being ruled unlawful by the courts</a> but they might be premature. </p> <p>The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, told Times Radio she would not comment on “operational details”, but said: “This is one person, it is not going to undermine the fundamental basis of this deal.”</p> <p>Sheldon said on Tuesday that he was “going to grant a short period of interim relief” so it is still possible that the claimant could eventually be deported.</p> <p>The Guardian is aware of one case in which a legal challenge lodged by an individual asylum seeker who was due to fly on Monday was unsuccessful, although he did not fly in the end. </p> <p>While arguments for the claimant on Wednesday were made about the destitution he would face in France, based on the experience of other asylum seekers there, Sheldon was not persuaded by that and focused on the fact that he was a potential victim of trafficking. </p> <p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/29/why-was-the-governments-rwanda-plan-for-asylum-seekers-ruled-unlawful\">the reasons the Rwanda scheme was held to be unlawful </a>included that it was deemed not to be a safe country for refugees, that refugees could have their applications for asylum incorrectly refused in Rwanda and that they would be at risk of return to countries where they would be in danger.</p> <p>However, Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, said the “vast majority” of people detained for the “one in, one out” scheme were torture and trafficking survivors, presenting the prospect of more potential court defeats. </p> <h2>Will the French take victims of trafficking and torture?</h2>  <p>Even before Tuesday’s high court decision, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/no-10-denies-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-is-shambles\">the viability of the “one in, one out” agreement was called into question</a> after plans to fly rejected asylum applicants to Paris on Monday and Tuesday were dropped.</p> <p>It is believed that the flights did not happen because of concerns of French authorities that the Home Office had not provided adequate notice of the vulnerabilities of some individuals, such as victims of trafficking and torture.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68909bb2486754ec288783c2/CS_France_2.2025_Dangerous_Journeys_Agreement.pdf\">treaty</a> signed last month, the UK needs to notify France in a statement “indicating that the person to be transferred may need medical assistance or care”.</p> <p>The cancelled flights have raised questions over whether France will take such individuals at all. </p> <h2>Why does the government not just change the law?</h2>  <p>Given that the previous government’s Rwanda scheme was ruled unlawful and Labour’s “one in, one out” policy has also fallen foul of the courts, could the government just use parliamentary sovereignty to change the law to prevent such outcomes? </p> <p>Most of the focus at the moment has been on leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts\">Reform UK has said it would do if elected</a> and the Tories also seem to be moving towards, or reforming the convention, and/or its UK implementation, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jun/18/shabana-mahmood-says-uk-will-seek-reform-of-human-rights-convention\">Labour has discussed</a>. While blaming the ECHR for the prevention of deportations, governments to date have not taken the drastic step of leaving, which would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/uk-could-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-to-stop-channel-migrant-boats\">make the UK an international outlier with Belarus and Russia</a>, and provoke a backlash from some quarters, both domestically and internationally. </p> <p>Even if it did leave the ECHR, there are multiple other conventions with protections relevant to deportations such as the refugee convention, the torture convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p> <p>And even if all of these conventions were exited/suspended as Reform have suggested, putting aside what that would do for the UK’s international reputation, it would not necessarily open the door to mass deportations regardless of an individual’s circumstances.</p> <p>Many rights derive from British common law and, in the absence of a politically appointed judiciary such as that in the US, judges in England and Wales would endeavour to uphold them.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A quarter of the average UK energy bill was funding corporate profits last year, according to analysis that reveals the hidden cost of privatising some of the UK’s key industries.</p> <p>The study – part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/uk-public-paid-200bn-to-shareholders-of-key-industries-since-privatisation-study\">wider Who Owns Britain project</a> by the Common Wealth thinktank – found that a sum equal to 24.2% of the average energy bill went to the pre-tax profits of the major electricity generators, networks and household suppliers in 2024.</p> <p>In addition, the analysis reveals the scale of wealth extracted from bill payers since the privatisation of Britain’s energy system. It found that shareholders of Britain’s privatised energy companies have taken at least £70.7bn in dividend payouts between 2010 and 2025, rather than reinvesting that money or reducing bills.</p> <p>Mathew Lawrence, director of Common Wealth, said the public was paying a high price for the “privatisation premium”.</p> <p>“They are lumped with higher energy bills that fund billions of pounds of shareholder payouts. That money should be invested to build homegrown clean power and help reduce costs.”</p> <p>The analysis found that £416 of the average bill of £1,719 was taken as pre-tax profits by the major electricity generators, networks and household suppliers last year.</p> <p>It also calculated that the energy networks that distribute gas and electricity to the UK’s homes and businesses had a profit margin of 55% between 2020 and 24, compared with a FTSE 350 average of 14%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/energytree-zip/giv-32554kMip5fXn3pME/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing the components of the average household electricity and gas bill\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/energytree-zip/giv-32554kMip5fXn3pME/\">Interactive</a> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/energy_slope-zip/giv-325541kvpYEKJmmY0/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing changing UK energy sector profit margins over time\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/energy_slope-zip/giv-325541kvpYEKJmmY0/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Chris Hayes, the Common Wealth chief economist, said the UK’s energy system was unfit for the challenges the country faced amid an escalating climate emergency and cost of living crisis.</p> <p>“Networks running natural monopolies have systematically underinvested in maintenance and expansion. A splintered retail sector has allowed generators to capture windfall profits. Meanwhile, our clean energy investment regime has been blown apart by the last few years of economic uncertainty. Public investment and vertical reintegration are desperately needed to overcome these challenges.”</p> <p>The study calculates that in the era of public ownership, investment in the energy system was twice as high relative to GDP as under the privatised era, helping deliver what the report describes as a period of “innovation and ambition, when Britain led the world in new nuclear power, rapidly rolled out the modernised ‘Supergrid’ and built the world’s first ocean-receiving LNG terminal at Canvey Island”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/there-are-no-buses-privatisation-dead-end-ludlow\">‘Birmingham is up the road but there are no buses’: privatisation a dead end for Ludlow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The privatisation of the energy sector was a key plank of the Tory government’s broader policy of reducing state involvement in the economy during the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Supporters argued it increased efficiency, improved choice and attracted private investment – therefore reducing the burden on the state.</p> <p>However, the Common Wealth report found that investment and innovation have stalled, bills have gone up and tens of billions of pounds have been taken from hard-pressed consumers and given to shareholders and corporations.</p> <p>Sandy Hager, from the University of London, said energy was not a luxury but “the lifeblood of our economy and daily lives”.</p> <p>“Households face soaring bills, over a quarter of which now goes to company profits, while investment has withered. If we’re serious about energy security and decarbonisation, the model is indefensible. We need an energy system organised around the public good, not shareholder dividends, which means bringing our networks and generation into public hands.”</p> <p>The analysis found that the nine largest electricity generators that account for two-thirds of total UK electricity generation, and the energy networks which transport electricity and gas from generators to homes and businesses, made £17.8bn in operating profits in 2023 – £10.4bn for generation; £7.4bn for networks.</p> <p>The analysis found that much of this profit was going to servicing company debt and shareholder payments rather than investment.</p> <p>In 2023, the last fully reported financial year for the companies analysed, they spent a total of £8.02bn on dividends, buybacks, and interest payments, of which £3.8bn came from the generation companies and £4.2bn came from the networks. This amounted to 9% of the typical 2023 energy bill.</p> <p>The report argues that money from bills – which leaks out of the energy system as dividends and expensive debt servicing – should be reinvested to build clean and affordable homegrown power.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the energy regulator, Ofgem, said it<strong> </strong>regulated the energy market to “ensure that any costs passed on to consumers are fair and accurate, and that the sector isn’t making excessive profits”.</p> <p>They added: “We also work hard to bear down on costs while attracting the investment needed to upgrade the system and move away from volatile international markets that drive the fluctuations in energy bills we’ve seen in recent years.”</p> <p>They said Ofgem had collected almost £500m “in payments from energy companies for not meeting our rules”.</p> <p>Lawrence Slade, the CEO of ENA, which represents the UK’s electricity network operators, said: “The £100bn of private investment made by network operators into the future of the UK’s energy grid to deliver the government’s clean power 2030 targets comes with regulated returns of 5% per year. This investment ensures the UK has the clean, secure and affordable energy it requires in the years ahead, money that UK taxpayers would otherwise need to find, whilst also maintaining one of the most safe, stable and resilient energy grids anywhere.</p> <p>“Cherrypicking figures from annual accounts of major long-term UK infrastructure spending risks giving a misleading picture of investment that is essential to the UK’s clean energy future.”</p> <p>In the UK, domestic prices were among the highest in Europe in the first half of 2024 and industrial users face some of the highest electricity prices in the world. Average household energy bills are now 63% higher than before the energy crisis.</p> <p>A recent YouGov survey found 71% of the electorate backed public ownership of energy companies.</p> <p>There are signs that the political consensus around privatisation is breaking down. The Labour government has established the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/19/gb-energy-needs-full-83bn-fundingdisappoint-government-told\">publicly owned GB Energy</a> and has completed the renationalisation of the grid, with the creation of the National Energy System Operator.</p> <p>The new Green party leadership and the new Your party vehicle have both made public ownership of energy central to their agendas, and even rightwing Reform UK has called for the renationalisation of privatised utilities like water.</p> <p>Mathew Lawrence said support for publicly owned power was “not about nostalgia”.</p> <p>“It is a proven and effective tool – from our own past and in comparator economies today – to deliver a more affordable and effective clean energy future. As the consensus on the status quo fragments, just like in the past, whoever seizes the mantle of change will reap the rewards.”</p> <p>Sophie Flinders, senior data analyst at Common Wealth, said the politics of energy was at “an inflection point”.</p> <p>“Attacks on the cost of the transition are increasing,” she said. “But higher bills are the result of private economic power not renewable power. The best response is to deliver new era of public power based on more coherent, certain, and cost-effective investment. The political prize is great: reducing a key driver of the cost of living crisis, delivering more homegrown clean power, and renewing consent for an ambitious transition.”</p>",

Cohen said that, amid tensions with Unilever, the brand had tried to engineer a sale to investors at a fair market value of $1.5bn-$2.5bn (£1.1bn-£1.8bn) but the proposal was rejected.</p> <p>“The problem is that Unilever and Magnum don’t want to sell, so they are not allowing any of these potential investors to see the financials,” said Cohen.</p> <p>A spokesperson for TMICC said it would be “forever grateful” to Greenfield for his role co-founding the company, but that the business “disagreed with his perspective” and had sought to engage both co-founders in a “constructive conversation” on how to strengthen the brand.</p> <p>In May, Cohen was charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/15/ben-jerrys-co-founder-arrested-protesting-gaza-blockade-senate-hearing\">protesting against the Gaza blockade</a> during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">US Senate</a> hearing.</p> <p>Video footage recorded at the hearing and <a href=\"https://x.com/YoBenCohen/status/1922760476439515310\">posted by Cohen</a> on social media showed him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away.</p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry’s was founded in 1978 after the two friends took a $5 correspondence course in ice-cream making.</p> <p>The pair – who met while at school in Merrick, on Long Island in New York – opened their first store in a renovated petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, with a mission to “advance human rights and dignity”.</p> <p>They chose fun, hippy names for their flavours, such as Cherry Garcia, after the late guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead – and even Cool Britannia.</p> <p>The company, which from 1985 began donating almost 8% of its annual pre-tax profits to charity, grew to become one of the biggest in the US.</p> <p>Its transition to mainstream international commercial success attracted the attention of then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/unilever-picks-london-as-its-home-over-rotterdam\">Anglo-Dutch</a> consumer goods company Unilever.</p> <p>In 2000, Unilever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/mar/30/internationalnews.unilever\">struck a $326m deal to buy the business</a>, a move that at the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/mar/30/internationalnews.unilever\">reportedly did not please Greenfield</a>, with stipulations including the creation of the brand’s own independent board to allow it to continue to take progressive stances on social and political issues and uphold its core values.</p> <p>“However much a [formerly] independent company will try to retain its identity and ethos, the corporate [buyer] will invariably call the shots in the long run,” said Nick Stockley, a partner and dispute resolution specialist at the law firm Mayo Wynne Baxter<strong>.</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>Governor Abbott called for expulsion, with university decrying video ‘trivializing or promoting violence’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Texas State University has ended the enrollment of a student who appeared to mock the assassination of conservative activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a> during a campus memorial event earlier this week.</p> <p>A video posted <a href=\"https://x.com/TexasRepublic71/status/1967949610640462012\">to social media on Tuesday morning</a> shows the student in the crowd slapping his neck multiple times, calling himself “Charlie Kirk”, and imitating Kirk when he was fatally shot in the neck on 10 September at Utah Valley University.</p> <p>“Charlie Kirk got hit in the neck, b---h,” the person says in the video.</p> <p>At one point in the video, the person can be seen walking through the crowd and up on to a statue, where he mimics Kirk getting shot and pretends to fall down.</p> <p>The video quickly gained attention, prompting Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, to share the video and call for the student to be expelled.</p> <p>“Hey Texas State. This conduct is not accepted at our schools,” Abbott <a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1967986189136519573\">wrote</a> . “Expel this student immediately. Mocking assassination must have consequences.”</p> <p>The Texas State University president, Kelly Damphousse, issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, <a href=\"https://x.com/txst/status/1968002531440951790\">calling the video</a> “disturbing” and confirmed that the video was taken at the school’s San Marcos campus.</p> <p>“I have directed university officials to take immediate steps to identify the individual in the video,” Damphousse said. “Behavior that trivializes or promotes violence is reprehensible and violates the values of TXST. It will not be tolerated. Let me be clear: expressions that glorify violence or murder have no place on our campuses.”</p> <p>Several hours later, Damphousse <a href=\"https://x.com/txst/status/1968076195163148561\">announced</a> that the individual in the video had been identified and was “no longer a student” at Texas State.</p> <p>The university did not release the name of the student and said that “federal law prevents the university from commenting further on individual student conduct matters.”</p> <p>In a separate message to Texas State students and community members, obtained by the<a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/news/article/charlie-kirk-texas-state-student-21051907.php\"> San Antonio Express News</a>, Damphousse reportedly said the incident “has shaken the Texas State community”.</p> <p>“The video understandably evoked strong emotions here and across the country,” he wrote. In the message, he also urged members of the Texas State community to “consider the impact that our words and actions can have on those around us.”</p> <p>The expulsion follows a similar incident at Texas Tech University, where an 18-year-old student was reportedly expelled this week after a video surfaced showing her disrupting a vigil for Kirk on campus.</p> <p>In the video, she is seen shouting “F--k y’all homie dead, he got shot in the head.”</p> <p>On Monday, Texas Tech confirmed to <a href=\"https://www.fox4news.com/news/texas-tech-student-expelled-after-charlie-kirk-rant-campus\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2025/09/15/texas-tech-student-arrested-charlie-kirk/86166455007/\">local media outlets </a>that the student was no longer enrolled at the university.</p> <p>“Any behavior that denigrates victims of violence is reprehensible, has no place on our campus, and does not align with our values,” the university said in a public <a href=\"https://x.com/TexasTech/status/1967630775420862486\">statement</a> on Monday. “Federal law prevents Texas Tech University from commenting on individual student conduct matters. We take all reported violations seriously and address them under university policy and the law.”</p> <p>Governor Abbott also weighed in on that incident, <a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1967325091144093983?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1967325091144093983%7Ctwgr%5Ec2a9f8f3f9d4023c85f5427f1e51092898bf3cb7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fox4news.com%2Fnews%2Ftexas-tech-student-expelled-after-charlie-kirk-rant-campus\">reposting the video</a> and writing: “Definitely picked the wrong school to taunt the death of Charlie Kirk”.</p> <p>The expulsions are part of a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/charlie-kirk-death-university-firing-suspension\">wave of disciplinary actions, </a>ranging from firings to suspensions, against individuals who have made public remarks about Kirk or Kirk’s death since the fatal shooting that some political, business and university leaders have deemed <a href=\"https://www.mtsu.edu/president/statement-from-mtsu-president-sidney-a-mcphee/\">“inappropriate”</a>.</p> <p>Since Kirk’s killing, a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secret-service-employee-who-celebrated-charlie-kirks-assassination-put-immediate-leave\">Secret Service employee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting\">journalists</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nasdaq-terminates-employee-over-social-180948755.html?guccounter=1\">junior strategist at Nasdaq</a>, <a href=\"https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/news/bullet-was-gift-from-god-louisiana-ag-responds-to-social-media-post-by-new-orleans-firefighter-on-charlie-kirks-death/\">firefighters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/etsu-suspends-two-faculty-over-charlie-kirk-posts/\">school employees</a> have reportedly lost their jobs over comments related to Kirk’s politics or death.</p> <p>The Texas Education Agency is investigating about 180 complaints against teachers accused of posting inappropriate remarks online about Kirk’s death, according to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/15/texas-education-teacher-comments-charlie-kirk/\">the Texas Tribune</a>.</p> <p>The Texas American Federation of Teachers has <a href=\"https://www.texasaft.org/government/tea/texas-aft-condemns-political-witch-hunt-against-texas-educators/\">condemned </a>the investigations, calling them a “political witch hunt against Texas educators”.</p> <p>“These ‘investigations’ into teachers exercising their First Amendment rights outside their official duties silence dissent and encourage the purging of civil servants,” the statement says.</p> <p>Zeph Capo, the president of the Texas American Federation of Teachers <a href=\"https://www.texasaft.org/government/tea/texas-aft-condemns-political-witch-hunt-against-texas-educators/\">said </a>that “what started with lawmakers weaponizing their platforms against civil servants has morphed into a statewide directive to hunt down and fire educators for opinions shared on their personal social media accounts”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Miki Zohar says he will cancel funding for the Ophir awards after The Sea, about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who is denied entry to Tel Aviv, wins best picture</p>",
    "content": "<p>Israel’s culture minister, Miki Zohar, has announced that funding for the Ophirs, the country’s national film awards, would be cancelled after The Sea, a film about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, won the best feature film prize.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/zoharm7/status/1968234990195417590\">In a statement on X</a>, translated by Israeli news media, Zohar said: “There is no greater slap in the face of Israeli citizens than the embarrassing and detached annual Ophir awards ceremony. Starting with the 2026 budget, this pathetic ceremony will no longer be funded by taxpayers’ money. Under my watch, Israeli citizens will not pay from their pockets for a ceremony that spits in the faces of our heroic soldiers.”</p> <p>The Sea, which automatically becomes Israel’s entry for the best international film Oscar, was written and directed by Shai Carmeli-Pollak. It stars Muhammad Gazawi as Khaled, a Palestinian boy who goes on a school trip to Tel Aviv to visit the beach for the first time but is denied entry at the border and embarks on a dangerous journey to sneak into the country. Gazawi, 13, won the Ophir for best actor, while co-star Khalifa Natour won best supporting actor. The awards are voted for by members of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.</p> <p>It is not clear, however, if Zohar can carry through with his threat: <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-867686\">according to the Jerusalem Post</a>, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel is investigating whether the culture ministry has the jurisdiction to pull funding from the awards.</p> <p>Zohar has a history of confronting Israel’s film industry: in February he introduced <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-12/ty-article/.premium/and-the-big-winner-of-israels-cinema-reform-a-west-bank-film-fund/00000194-f9b2-db1f-a5dd-f9b3b3830000\">a bill to reform film funding</a> by pushing government money towards commercially successful productions, and said that the <a href=\"https://x.com/zoharm7/status/1896456450932658584\">Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land</a> was “sabotage against the state of Israel”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/israel-the-sea-oscars-international-feature-race-1236520921/\">Variety reported</a> that The Sea’s Palestinian producer Baher Agbariya received the award with a plea for equality and tolerance, saying: “This film was born from love for humanity and cinema, and its message is one – the right of every child to live and dream in peace, without siege, without fear, and without war.” Protests against the war in Gaza were much in evidence at the ceremony, with participants wearing T-shirts bearing messages such as “a child is a child” and “end the war”.</p> <p>Agbariya also thanked the Israel Film Fund for supporting the film.</p> <p>Veteran director Uri Barbash, best known for the 1984 prison drama Beyond the Walls, was given a lifetime achievement award, and also called for an end to the war in his acceptance speech, saying. “It is our sacred duty to return all the kidnapped to the bosom of their families, and immediately, to end the damned war and replace the ‘divide and rule’ regime that declared war on Israeli society.”</p> <p>Responding to Zohar’s statement, Assaf Amir, chair of Israeli Academy of Film and Television, said: “In the face of the Israeli government’s attacks on Israeli cinema and culture, and the calls from parts of the international film community to boycott us, the selection of The Sea is a powerful and resounding response.”</p> <p>The controversy follows a pledge signed by over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/09/israeli-film-industry-calls-boycott-pledge-deeply-troubling\">3,000 international film industry figures</a> to boycott Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. Olivia Colman, Javier Bardem, Riz Ahmed and Emma Stone were among the high-profile actors and film-makers to put their name to the letter.</p> <p>Representatives of the Israeli film industry called the boycott “deeply troubling”, with Nadav Ben Simon, chairman of the Israeli screenwriters’ guild, saying: “Over the years, we have also collaborated with Palestinian colleagues on films, series, and documentaries that seek to encourage dialogue, mutual understanding, peace and an end to violence … [Boycotts] do not advance the cause of peace. Instead, they harm precisely those who are committed to fostering dialogue and building bridges between peoples.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/12/paramount-israeli-film-industry-boycott\">Hollywood studio Paramount issued a statement</a> on Saturday criticising the boycott, saying: “We do not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli film-makers. Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Anderson updates Thomas Pynchon for the era of Ice roundups, pitting shaggy revolutionary Leonardo DiCaprio against cartoonish forces of reaction</p>",
    "content": "<p>One of the great creative bromances has flowered again: Paul Thomas Anderson and Thomas Pynchon. Having adapted Pynchon’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/inherent-vice-review-paul-thomas-anderson\">Inherent Vice</a> for the screen in 2015, Anderson has now taken a freer rein with his 1990 novel Vineland, creating a bizarre action thriller driven by pulpy comic-book energy and transformed political indignation, keeping his pedal at all times welded to the metal.</p> <p>It’s a riff on the now recognisable Anderson-Pynchonian idea of counterculture and counter-revolution, absorbing the paranoid style of American politics into a screwball farcical resistance, with a jolting, jangling, nerve-shredding score by Jonny Greenwood. It’s partly a freaky-Freudian diagnosis of father-daughter dysfunction – juxtaposed with the separation of migrant children and parents at the US-Mexico border – and a very serious, relevant response to the US’s secretive ruling class and its insidiously normalised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) roundups: the toxic new Vichyite Trump enthusiasm.</p> <p>Pynchon imagined the subversiveness of the 60s having its contested sequel in the Reaganite 80s; Anderson brings the time gap between these eras into the present day, although there isn’t the a cultural distinction between what are evidently the last days of Obama and contemporary Trump pomp. Specific references such as Maga and BLM aren’t mentioned.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQUPdVxZNPk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kQUPdVxZNPk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Leonardo DiCaprio is Bob, a dishevelled revolutionary, who is to become even more dishevelled in the future when he will do a great deal of panicky running through the streets in his dressing gown, whining that he has nowhere to charge his phone. Bob is part of a heavily armed activist cell that attacks migrant holding prisons on the Mexican border; Bob’s (humble) job is to set off fireworks as a diversionary-slash-celebratory tactic, and he is less important than his comrades, such as badass Deandra (Regina Hall) and cerebral Howard (played in cameo by composer and Yale academic Paul Grimstad).</p> <p>Bob is passionately devoted to his partner and charismatic comrade, interestingly named Perfidia (Teyana Taylor). And Bob is not the only one. When the group attack the military compound, Perfidia captures and humiliates the aggressively reactionary Col Steven Lockjaw – played by Sean Penn with all manner of lizardly head-jerking, chin-jutting geezer mannerisms – who clearly derives sexual excitement from the whole business, and his creepy, cartoony unwholesomeness is another driving force. With the cold calculation of a born leader, Perfidia sees how she can toy with Lockjaw’s infatuation, using him to control and divert military opposition. Does she take it too far? Does the idea of taking things too far in fact have any meaning in this context? Perfidia deafeningly firing an assault rifle while in the ninth month of her pregnancy is one of the film’s most amazing images. </p> <p>It is poor, befuddled Bob’s destiny to bring up a daughter he thinks is his, as a single dad. Sixteen-year-old Willa (Chase Infiniti) is as smart and focused as her mom, instructed in martial arts by her sensei (Benicio del Toro), while Bob gets more messed up on drugs and booze all day, watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/11/drama.worldcinema\">Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers</a> on TV, grumpily refusing to remember her friends’ preferred pronouns. But the forces of darkness encircle them once more, and when his old revolutionary friends re-emerge to contact him, Bob realises his brain is too fried to remember the all-important code words on the phone. As for Willa, she is now stuck with troubled thoughts about her mother and a mortifying question concerning Bob and Lockjaw, like the heroine of Mamma Mia! The Movie.</p> <p>One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen – an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream?</p> <p>Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.</p> <p>• One Battle After Another is out on 25 September in Australia, and on 26 September in the UK and US</p>",

    "description": "",
    "content": "<p>My husband, Ulrich Loening, who has died aged 94, was a lecturer first in the botany and then in the zoology departments (now the molecular plant sciences and biological sciences departments) of Edinburgh University. He engaged in fundamental research and made significant contributions to the developing science of molecular biology.</p> <p>He had always had a great interest and concern for the natural world. After the establishment by Conrad Waddington, a professor of genetics, of the school of the man-made future at Edinburgh, Ulrich became actively involved in environmental and green issues.</p> <p>In 1984 Ulrich was appointed director of the Centre for Human Ecology (CHE) at the university. Human ecology was a new and developing concept, which broadened environmental science to encompass the study of all aspects of human behaviour that affects the biosphere.</p> <p>Ulrich was born in Berlin to<strong> </strong>Lilli (nee Cohn) and Erich Loening, a photochemist who developed early colour printing methods and later worked for Kodak. His parents had moved from Berlin to London in 1937 to escape Nazi persecution. In Ulrich’s teenage years the family lived in Jordans, Buckinghamshire, a centre of Quakerism.</p> <p>Although he never became a member of the Society of Friends, he attended Quaker meetings and was influenced by their thinking. His interest in nature, in ecological issues and in organic agriculture stemmed from his early experiences in a rural environment, of gardening and keeping bees and chickens, and by Quaker concepts of self-sufficiency.</p> <p>Ulrich went to Merchant Taylors’ school, north-west London, and then studied biochemistry at Wadham College, Oxford (where he also got his doctorate), graduating in 1954.</p> <p>We met in Oxford in 1955, while performing music – Ulrich played the cello and I played the violin. We married in 1957 and moved to Edinburgh in 1959, where Ulrich first took up an Agricultural Research Council fellowship at the botanic gardens.</p> <p>In 1992 Ulrich and some colleagues established the first master’s degree in human ecology. Although the CHE was closed in 1996, the MSc course continued to run via the Open University and later Strathclyde University.</p> <p>In the early 1970s, together with four other families, we bought a derelict steading (farm buildings) and renovated what had been a coach house into a family home in Ormiston, East Lothian. A large garden made us self-sufficient in vegetables and fruit.</p> <p>An adjacent piece of neglected woodland was acquired by the group, in which we planted more than 1,000 trees. Ulrich was a skilled woodworker and in 1958 made a cello. He built much of his own laboratory equipment.</p> <p>Ulrich is survived by me, our three children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The EU executive has called for a suspension of free trade with Israel and sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers in response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p> <p>Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/ursula-von-der-leyen-suspension-eu-trade-israel\">had already floated the proposal</a> to suspend the trade parts of the EU-Israel association agreement last week as the European Commission faced intense pressure for greater action amid criticism that it was not using its economic leverage to influence the Israeli government.</p> <p>There is, however, no certain majority from EU member states for the proposals outlined on Wednesday, because Germany, one of Israel’s key allies, has long been reluctant to take such steps.</p> <p>The proposals include suspending Israel’s preferential access to the European market by reimposing tariffs on some goods, and freezing mutual benefits related to bidding for public contracts and the protection of intellectual property rights.</p> <p>The commission also called for sanctions on Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank and 10 Hamas leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/who-are-bezalel-smotrich-and-itamar-ben-gvir-the-israeli-ministers-facing-sanctions\">Who are Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the Israeli ministers facing sanctions?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plans were presented as Israeli forces pressed ahead with their offensive in Gaza City, deepening a conflict that has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians since Hamas attacked Israel on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/the-middle-east-in-crisis-7-october-the-day-that-changed-the-world\">7 October 2023</a>, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages.</p> <p>The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, said the proposal meant goods from Israel would be charged at duties equivalent to countries with no free-trade agreement with the bloc. “We regret having to take this step. However, we believe it is both appropriate and proportionate given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” he said.</p> <p>Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, wrote on X that the European proposals were “morally and politically distorted, and it is to be hoped that they will not be adopted, as has been the case so far”.</p> <p>The commission has been unable to secure the necessary majority for more modest plans to suspend EU research grants to Israeli organisations. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, suggested on Wednesday that the same divisions remained.</p> <p>“Although we see that the public opinion in member states is really shifting because of the suffering in Gaza … on a political level … I think the political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far,” she said.</p> <p>For the preferential trade or research grants suspensions to pass, Germany or Italy would have to lend their support. Both measures depend on finding a weighted majority of 15 out of 27 member states representing at least 65% of the EU’s population.</p> <p>Asked about the trade proposals, a German government spokesperson said Berlin had “not yet formed a final opinion on them”.</p> <p>The sanctions against the Israeli ministers and Hamas leaders require unanimity. Hungary has previously blocked some EU sanctions against Israeli settlers. The commission had shied away from targeting Ben-Gvir and Smotrich in anticipation of a veto from Budapest, a close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu’s nationalist government.</p> <p>The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel’s worldwide trade in goods. The EU-Israel association agreement, formalised in 2000, underpins the €68bn (£59bn) trading relationship and increases cooperation in research, environment and energy.</p> <p>The reimposition of tariffs would affect €5.8bn of Israel’s exports, resulting in about €227m in duties.</p> <p>Kallas suggested she did not support attempts to exclude Israel from Eurovision, after Spain became the latest country to say it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/16/spain-eurovision-boycott-israel-gaza-war\">would boycott the song contest</a> if Israel took part.</p> <p>Asked about the issue, she said EU measures were intended to put pressure on the Israeli government to change course on Gaza, not to punish Israel or the Israeli people.</p> <p>“All these steps that go to the direction of punishing Israeli people, I think are wrong and we are not really proposing them,” she said.</p>",

    "description": "<p>‘When I stopped to let him out, he was looking down. I didn’t know what he was doing. Turned out he was writing a poem about me. I still have it’</p>",
    "content": "<p>I drove a cab in New York for three decades. Riding around, I would meet poets, drag queens and other people who were inspiring. It made me feel good. I started taking their portraits, sometimes with me in the picture. I had several cameras and would often have my strobe hooked on to my visor with a rubber band.</p> <p>This particular evening, in 1990, I had been informed by a friend that there was a book event going on so I went to take a look. It was jam-packed inside. I spotted Allen Ginsberg, so I went over and talked to him a little. He was pretty intense, kind of stressed, so I had to lay back a little but I asked him if he could write an introduction to my book In My Taxi. But he had too much going on.</p> <p>I went out, got in my cab and started driving off, but then I thought: “Hey, I think I’ll cruise back.” People were coming out of the building and I spotted Allen. I guess he recognised me. I was a pain in the ass to him, probably. Anyway he came over and got into my cab – a great, real, joyful moment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I photographed him alone too, but the idea was for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that picture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I stopped at the Bowery to let him out and he was looking at the meter where I have this tape coming out of it, for receipts. He said: “Hand me that tape.” So I tore it off and handed it to him. He’s looking down. I don’t know what he’s doing, but I’m not gonna rush him. A little more time with Allen. Turns out he was writing this poem about me, which I still have.</p> <p>I don’t call myself an artist, I leave that up to the audience. I went to college in southern California, and then Berkeley, for graduate work, and I was doing lithographs and photography. I got to New York in 1980. The rent was unaffordable but nothing was going to deter me from going to the city. I saw some crazy places – one guy was showering in the kitchen sink – but finally I found an ad in the New York Times for a place for $250 a month. I went to see it and was met by this real jovial, heavy-set man. The floor was dirt and it was 250 sq ft. Oh my God, I’d never seen anything like that in my life – but it was manifest destiny, because my dark room fitted into its east corner and right up to the window, so I had fresh air whenever I opened it.</p> <p>Another manifest destiny was that I had a neighbour who drove a cab. When he would hear me opening the door, he’d open his and we’d have a friendly conversation. One day, he says to me: “Do you want to go out with me tonight in the cab?” I said: “Oh my God, yeah, yeah.” So I went out and the rest is history, man. I applied for a hack license.</p> <p>My taxi portraits started with a Latino guy wearing a black kind of derby hat. He had a nice presence about him. I looked at him and said hey. I was nervous. This was my first time I’d taken my camera and equipment with me and he let me photograph him. That was the beginning and it just went crazy, man. I was constantly bombarded with opportunities. I would pick up a fare or maybe something was happening and I’d notice it and take a shot or two, then I’m gone. Or I would drop someone off and there would be something there, some sort of a billboard, a picture of a lady or whatever and the composition all came together. Sometimes, if my equipment wasn’t working properly, I would give the strobe to the passengers and say: “Hey, when you hear the click of my camera, hit the strobe.” So we’d have a dual thing going on.</p> <p>When I had Ginsberg in my cab, I photographed him alone too, but the idea was mainly for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that picture, put my feelings there. I called it Allen Ginsberg, offering me up a fortune cookie.</p> <p>• Ryan Weideman’s work is at <a href=\"https://www.parisphoto.com/en-gb.html\">Paris Photo, 13-16 November</a>, with the Bruce Silverstein gallery.</p> <h2>Ryan Weideman’s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Oklahoma, 1941<br><strong>Trained:</strong> California College of Arts &amp; Crafts<br><strong>Influences:</strong> “William Klein and Ansel Adams.”<br><strong>High point:</strong> “Getting my first review – a really fantastic one – in the New York Times.”<br><strong>Low point:</strong> “I don’t know how to answer this.

    "description": "<p>Career experts warn of decades of progress lost as administration fires staff, slashes budgets and buries data</p>",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump’s</a> second presidency has spelled upheaval or worse for multiple spheres of US government. But for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science\">science</a> – long a key driver of the US’s global preeminence – it has heralded the perfect storm.</p> <p>In public health, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange\">climate science</a>, environmental protection and nuclear safety, seasoned career specialists have been left bewildered and often jobless under a ferocious onslaught from the president, apparently aimed at gaining control over a sector about which he has displayed strongly-held views, if frequently flawed understanding.</p> <p>Now, experts warn, the US faces a loss of scientific expertise across multiple fronts that could takes decades to restore in a purge that has seen thousands of government scientists fired and billions of dollars slashed from research programs that were previously deemed vital.</p> <p>Some observers compare Trump’s offensive to contemporary authoritarian regimes such as Hungary and Russia under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>. One even likens it to the ruthless efforts of Hitler and Stalin to bring scientists to heel in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>“The Trump administration is trying to undermine the scientific method as a basis of making determinations, both in the scientific field and for application to improve public policy,” said Paul Josephson, emeritus professor at Colby College in Maine, and a specialist in the history of 20th century science and technology.</p> <p>“It is designating which kinds of science are good and which are inappropriate. It’s come up with a list of terms that should not be mentioned in scientific articles, or end research that disproportionately [focuses on] women, trans people, black people or people of color.”</p> <p>Josephson cited the phenomenon of “Lysenkoism” – named after the Soviet biologist, Trofim Lysenko, who rejected genetics and science-based agriculture – as an example of the long-term dangers of top-down dogmatic beliefs. Lysenko’s pseudo-scientific beliefs were backed by Stalin and led to the arrests, imprisonment and, in some cases, even executions of dissenting scientists. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>’s approach captured headlines last month when the White House fired Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after she clashed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr\">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, the health secretary, over vaccine policy.</p> <p>Monarez, an infectious diseases specialist who had been in her post for just a month, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?mod=hp_opin_pos_1\">wrote that</a> she was ordered to pre-approve the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel due to meet this month that had been filled with people with anti-vaccine views.</p> <p>Kennedy expounded on his own hardline anti-vaccine opinions in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/rfk-jr-hearing-calls-resign-democrats\">heated testimony before a Senate committee</a> last week, where he faced Democrat calls to resign as he defended his purge of federal public health agencies, which have undergone mass staff cuts since he was confirmed in office.</p> <p>Yet his actions have been part of a broader canvas in the war against science.</p> <p>The Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit group, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/resources/science-and-democracy-under-siege#read-online-content\">documented 402 incidents</a> it defined as “attacks on science” between Trump’s 20 January inauguration and the end of June.</p> <p>These included firing or demoting federal scientists, halting data collection in scientific studies by federal agencies, censoring scientists and rolling back regulations based on sound scientific evidence. There have also been moves to restrict access to data, reports and guidance.</p> <p>Trump signaled his determination to bring science under his direct ambit in an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/\">executive order issued in May entitled “restoring gold standard science”</a>.</p> <p>It claimed that “confidence that scientists act in the best interests of the public has fallen significantly.” It blamed “the falsification of data by leading researchers” for his own administration’s termination of numerous federal research grants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/improving-oversight-of-federal-grantmaking/\">Another order issued last month </a>vowed closer scrutiny of National Science Foundation grants, citing an unidentified “study” that claimed one-quarter of such awards in 2024 went to “diversity, equity, and inclusion and other far-left initiatives”.</p> <p>Jennifer Jones, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, US science was undergoing an “unprecedented…assault from all angles”.</p> <p>“They’re sidelining science,” she said. “At the same time, they’re uplifting junk science and quackery that’s going to help and support their billionaire [supporters] and bottom lines.”</p> <p>The effects, she warned, would endure. “There will be lasting damage, and it will likely take multiple political administrations to get over and to rebuild what has been lost.”</p> <p>Among the most affected areas are:</p> <h2><strong>Public health</strong></h2> <p>According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Department of Health and Human Services shed nearly a quarter (24%) of its staff, around 20,000 workers, between Trump’s return to office and mid-May – the highest proportion of any federal science agency.</p> <p>Before the row that triggered Monarez’s firing, Kennedy <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/trump-administration-cancels-nearly-500-million-funding-mrna-vaccine-development\">cancelled</a> $500m in funding for the development of mRNA vaccines – which are currently used for Covid-19 but subject to research as a treatment for a host of other conditions, including certain cancers, HIV, rabies and Zika.</p> <p>On 27 May, the administration cancelled a $590m contract with Moderna supporting the development of a bird flu vaccine.</p> <p>Kennedy also announced that the CDC would no longer recommend Covid booster shots for healthy children and pregnant women. He falsely claimed that recommendations of repeat boosters for children were unsupported by clinical data.</p> <p>Trump had previously issued an<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-prohibits-federal-funding-for-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-in-schools/#:~:text=The%20Order%20bars%20federal%20funds,to%20attend%20in%2Dperson%20education\"> executive order</a> prohibiting Covid mandates in schools.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/improving-the-safety-and-security-of-biological-research/\">Another order in May halted research into “dangerous gain-of-function (GOF) research”</a> on viruses and pathogens – claiming that such research was being carried out without sufficient oversight and citing the unsubstantiated theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from a lab in China that used similar research methods.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/covid-vaccine-boosters-rfk\"> limited access</a> to Covid shots, saying only people over 65 and those at high risk of complications from the virus need them.</p> <p>Amid this intense vaccine-hostility, groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association – as well as at least one Republican senator, Bill Cassidy – have accused the administration of denying vaccines to people who want it.</p> <p>Concerns extend beyond vaccine policy. Last week, Kennedy was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health\">accused of burying a report</a> – commissioned during Joe Biden’s presidency and submitted to the health department in March – that posited evidence of a link between alcohol and cancer. Critics say the stance contradicts Kennedy’s self-proclaimed make America health again (Maha) agenda.</p> <p>Among numerous firings at the National Institute of Health were staff researching into Alzheimer’s disease at the institute’s center for Alzheimer’s and related dementias (Card), <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-fires-workers-nihs-alzheimers-research-center/story?id=119053406%3E\">ABC News reported</a>. They included Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, who had been earmarked as the center’s next acting director.</p> <p>The CDC is also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5509976/drowning-prevention-program-halt-cdc\">eliminating its drowning prevention program</a>, established in response to a spike of drowning incidents during the Covid pandemic. More than 4,000 people drown in the US each year, and it is the leading cause of death among children aged one to four.</p> <h2><strong>Climate</strong></h2> <p>About 800 researchers, meteorologists and engineers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdell8n14x2o\">fired</a> in February in a move specialists warned would impede vital hurricane forecasting and climate modeling work.</p> <p>A further 10 fellows from a post-doctoral program on climate and global change run by the agency were put on <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/commerce-department-suspends-work-extreme-rainfall-database\">unpaid leave</a> in July. Meanwhile, the commerce department indefinitely suspended work on part of Noaa’s Atlas 15 program, which provides data on extreme rainfalls and how they are impacted by climate change.</p> <p>The administration’s budget proposal for 2026 envisions a $1.52bn cut to Noaa’s allocation, with cuts specifically targeting climate programs.</p> <p>The White House’s office of management and budget (OMB) also proposes a $20.29bn cut to the energy department, with its office of science budget targeted for a $1.15m reduction.</p> <p>The administration has marginalized the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/climate/national-climate-assessment-authors-dismissed.html\">national climate assessment</a>, despite it being mandated by Congress to be conducted every four years. In April, it dismissed 400 volunteer experts who had prepared to work on the latest assessment.</p> <p>As of the end of June, national climate assessment were no longer available on federal government websites, with no explanation or links to alternative sources provided, according to Columbia University’s Sabin center for climate change law.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/department-defense-stop-sharing-satellite-data-scientists\">announced</a> that it would stop providing atmospheric and oceanic data to scientists and weather forecasters, citing “cybersecurity concerns”.</p> <h2><strong>Environmental Protection</strong></h2> <p>Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific determination that greenhouse gases endanger human health, and instead interpret its authority narrowly under the Clean Air Act. Experts say such a move threatens the legal basis for federal climate regulation.</p> <p>The EPA also <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250724194914/https://apnews.com/article/epa-zeldin-trump-reorganization-science-research-acf0ad3a649f940e138b2a917169405f\">announced</a> plans to eliminate its office of research and development – long seen as the linchpin of its mission to protect the environment and human health – and replace it with a new office of applied science and environmental solutions. In so doing, it is set to cut its workforce by 3,700 – down by nearly a quarter since Trump took office.</p> <p>Last week, the EPA <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/epa-seeks-to-roll-back-pfas-drinking-water-rules-keeping-millions-exposed-to-toxic-forever-chemicals-in-tap-water\">disclosed it was no longer prepared to uphold rules</a> designed to protect people from unsafe levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas ) – also known as “forever chemicals – in drinking water. It asked a federal court to reverse legal protections against four such chemicals put in place by Congress just last year.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the agency <a href=\"https://carboncredits.com/u-s-epas-2-4-billion-deregulation-plan-how-ending-greenhouse-gas-reporting-could-affect-americas-climate-future/\">said</a> it would end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) – a move that it said would end the obligations of around 8,000 large business concerns in the US to report their carbon emissions and save businesses $2.4bn over the next decade. Lee Zeldin, the EPA’s Trump-appointed administrator, dismissed the program as “bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality”.</p> <p>Trump has issued a series of orders undercutting clean energy initiatives, fueled by his frequently-expressed antipathy towards wind turbines.</p> <p>“We have a president who rejects wind power because he says it makes whales go nuts,” said Josephson, the Colby College historian. “He claims that wind power is unsafe and that it’s not good otherwise for the nation, but [the real reason] is to support the fossil fuel industry. By doing that, he will give the leadership to European countries, and especially to China, in the areas of wind power.”</p> <h2><strong>Nuclear Safety</strong></h2> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the US’s nuclear safety watchdog, has lost nearly 200 staff since Trump’s inauguration – amounting to a “brain drain” of expertise that former officials say raises the risk of future accidents.</p> <p>Nearly half of the agency’s 28-strong senior leadership team have been installed in an “acting” capacity, while only three of its five commissioners’ positions are filled.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f082e338-d4bf-4b5b-882d-09a8795a93ef\">The Financial Times</a> quoted a Scott Morris, a recently-retired former deputy executive director of operations, as calling the staffing situation, in which some senior leaders have been pushed out, “unprecedented”.</p> <p>Two dozen nuclear reactors are currently under development in the US, prompting Morris to warn that replacing qualified professionals with politically motivated appointees at the agency would be “a dangerous game” that could lead to serious problems going undetected until years in the future.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/17/borderlands-4-review-chaotic-colourful-shooter-grown-up",
    "description": "<p><strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch 2; Gearbox Software/2K Games</strong><br>Familiar and predictable, but also well-honed and significantly less juvenile, the fourth Borderlands game is a blast</p>",
    "content": "<p>Once a games franchise hits its fourth outing, it is certainly mature – yet maturity is not a word generally associated with Borderlands, the colourful and performatively edgy looter-shooter from Texas. This series is characterised by a pervasive and polarising streak of distinctly adolescent humour. But in Borderlands 4, developer Gearbox has addressed that issue: it features plenty of returning characters in its storyline, but this time around they are more world-weary and less annoyingly manic. Borderlands has finally matured, to an extent. And not before time.</p> <p>Borderlands 4 still flings jokes at you thick and fast, and they are still hit-or-miss, but at least its general humour is a bit more sophisticated than before. It retains the distinctive cel-shaded graphical style and gun and ordnance-heavy gameplay that people have always loved. Indeed, it throws even more guns at you than any of its predecessors, and with a little work at filtering out the best ones, you will find plenty of absolute gems with which to take on hordes of straightforward enemies and more interesting bosses. A decent storyline emerges after the formulaic first few hours, eventually sending you off on some unexpected, fun and sometimes gratifyingly surreal tangents.</p> <p>The action takes place on Kairos, a planet new to the series, which feels more coherent than any of Borderlands’ previous settings. Kairos’s inhabitants are suffering under the totalitarian yoke of the tyrant Timekeeper, so you must rouse the downtrodden natives into joining your resistance movement, liberating tribes of folk by eliminating the Timekeeper’s oppressive lieutenants and removing surveillance-and-control implants from their necks. The deeper you get into the story, the more sidetracks and digressions you find, from dungeon-like vaults stashed with loot to environmental puzzles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4qeqPZJTaE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z4qeqPZJTaE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>You play as one of four vault-hunters – a Siren with summoning powers, an Exosoldier super-soldier, a hammer-wielding tank called a Forgeknight and a tech-wielding Gravitar. Each has battlefield skills that are crucial when you’re up against it, giving you the chance to spawn scythe-wielding phantom reapers, turrets, or defensive shields. The usual high-quality shooting is present and correct, but movement has been greatly improved: you get a grapple, a hover-bike and a huge jump-and-glide, all of which come in handy in the heat of frenetic battle <em>and </em>when you’re out exploring. They also translate well to the series’ famed co-op play, which supports up to four players.</p> <p>Borderlands 4 is a big game – the main storyline takes 20 to 30 hours to complete, and there’s plenty to do afterwards. It is not entirely frictionless: sometimes you need to traverse huge distances in its missions, and the directional indicator that helps you along the way is annoyingly erratic. And it has been buggy at launch: playing on PC, it has occasionally crashed on me, even after a huge patch, and early players <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash\">have reported problems</a> with stuttering and other performance issues. But Borderlands needed to grow up a bit, and that’s exactly what it has done, without losing its essential charm. Its top-quality shooter action might be comfortably familiar, but it’s also an awful lot less annoying than it used to be.</p> <p>• Borderlands 4 is out now; £59.99</p>",

The prep for each game is different, each team has a way of defending and attacking so he will prepare us in the best way possible,” he said.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/31/psg-win-champions-league-for-first-time-with-record-5-0-final-hammering-of-inter\">winning the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain</a> last season, Donnarumma was in the XI that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double\">lost July’s Club World Cup final</a> to Chelsea. “Before summer I knew City were very interested in me,” he said. “The relationship strengthened after the Club World Cup. I knew the coach was pushing for my arrival and it spurred me on.”</p>    <p>PSG signalled he was for sale after Luis Enrique signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille. Donnarumma was asked if it was a strange summer, with it being claimed by PSG’s strategic adviser, Luís Campos, that new contract demands presaged his departure.</p> <p>“I don’t really like to talk about the past,” Donnarumma said. “Some people make their own decisions and choices, it is part of football. My desire was to come here. That was my first and only option. My only choice was to come here.”</p> <p>City host Napoli in Thursday’s opening Champions League group game.

Guardiola was asked about his good start in Italy. “Players at that level adapt so quick,” said City’s manager. “He has incredible talent – his vision, passing and goals in the final third.

    "description": "<p>Architect known for the exposed structures of his buildings and the geodesic domes of the Eden Project</p>",
    "content": "<p>Of all the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/18/superstructure-hi-tech-architecture-1960-1990-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-uea-norman-foster\">“high tech” architects</a> who began their careers in the London of the 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/nicholas-grimshaws-architecture-eden-project\">Nicholas Grimshaw</a>, who has died aged 85, was perhaps the most interested in skill. He never built a swaggering, colourful masterpiece like Renzo Piano and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/19/richard-rogers-lord-rogers-obituary\">Richard Rogers</a>’s Pompidou Centre. He did not shape the international architectural language of global modernism in the way that Norman Foster has done. But Grimshaw did have the ability to temper his excitement for the potential of shiny, machine-made precision with a passion for skilful craftsmanship at a highly detailed level. </p> <p>He put the two together to build the remarkable international terminal at Waterloo Station, London, in 1993. Its skeletal, serpentine roof demonstrates Grimshaw’s fascination for the exposed structures of gothic cathedrals and the Victorian daring of Joseph Paxton and Brunel that he always loved. Structurally, Waterloo’s roof was the product of the engineering brilliance of Grimshaw’s long-term collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/07/tony-hunt-obituary\">Tony Hunt</a>. But it was Grimshaw and his team who lovingly oversaw the fabrication of every component and left them almost unnervingly exposed, like the giant bones of the dinosaur fossils in the Natural History Museum. Grimshaw himself said that his architecture “glorifies construction, and the beauty of the way things go together”.</p> <p>It was Grimshaw’s blend of enthusiasms that made his Eden Project in Cornwall such a huge and popular success when it opened in 2001. It became a visitor attraction even before a single plant come into bloom in its huge greenhouses. </p>    <p>Inspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller, the maverick American author of Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, who had planned to cover most of Manhattan with a menacing-looking geodesic dome in order to protect the city from pollution, Grimshaw took what was an awful dystopian warning, and used it to create a welcoming landmark. His and Hunt’s cluster of geodesic steel structures, supporting inflatable transparent cells that could control the climate, transformed an abandoned china clay pit into a sprawling indoor landscape of subtropical gardens and rainforests, and reignited the economy of a faltering Cornish community. </p> <p>For Grimshaw, the high tech approach was the way to turn the messy, earthbound and mud-soaked business of architecture into a kind of magic trick. He wanted to use modern materials to create lightweight, prefabricated components that could be put together in an instant, such as the Meccano construction kits that he had played with as a child. </p> <p>Born in Hove, he was the son of Joan (nee Dearsley), a painter, and Thomas Grimshaw, an engineer. He went to Wellington college, in Berkshire, then studied architecture at Edinburgh College of Art and the Architectural Association in London. On graduation in 1965 he set up the Farrell Grimshaw Partnership with Terry Farrell. Their first commission was to turn a terrace of 19th-century houses near Paddington station into a student hostel. They craned in an ingenious free-standing steel, plastic and glass tower supporting a spiral ramp that contained enough bathrooms to service the whole block. Fuller came to see it for himself, and was impressed. Grimshaw, with his dandyish style, trademark blue spectacles, and flowing cavalier locks seemed to represent the fashionable London of the time. </p> <p>He and Farrell went on to build a pioneering co-operative block of flats overlooking Regent’s Park, in which they both lived with their families for a period. Its crinkly metal skin was modelled on a Citroën van. It was followed by a stream of successful industrial buildings, including the Herman Miller factory in Bath and a number of social housing projects.</p>    <p>While his contemporaries began to explore other ideas, Grimshaw’s architectural language stayed fundamentally consistent. His inspirations were naked aluminium, the imagery of the airship and the Airstream caravan. It was his determination to stick with one end of the architectural spectrum that contributed to his break-up with Farrell in the late 70s. The partnership ended, but both of them went on to build highly successful practices in their own ways. </p> <p>Grimshaw got his first project outside Britain when Rolf Fehlbaum, owner of the Vitra furniture company, asked him to plan a new industrial campus in Weil am Rhein, Germany, in 1981, setting the scene for work by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/01/zaha-hadid-obituary\">Zaha Hadid</a>, Frank Gehry and Tadao Ando. In 1988 Grimshaw built an impressive printing works for the Financial Times, and the practice later designed massive new airports for St Petersburg and Istanbul, as well as a <a href=\"https://grimshaw.global/projects/industry-and-energy/rolls-royce-manufacturing-plant-and-headquarters/\">car factory for Rolls-Royce</a> and the National Space Centre in Leicester. </p> <p>When journalists asked Grimshaw about the “high tech” label that he was unable to escape, he would shrug. “Everybody should be building with the technology of their own age – the Edwardians were very high tech. It’s the way you look at how materials are put together that matters. To me, that is what makes for real architecture as opposed to scenery. Quinlan Terry once said he didn’t care what his buildings were made of so long as they looked Georgian. That just the opposite of what I’m about.”</p> <p>Grimshaw was always more interested in performance than in style or the symbolic meanings of architecture. “I like to think our approach is one you’d get from a good boat builder. It’s not the same boat every time, but you recognise that it’s from the same mind and hands.” </p> <p>Like so many architects, Grimshaw took real pleasure in sailing. He kept his boat in Norfolk, and treated sailing as much a research topic as a hobby. In one of his former studios, the main staircase was fabricated from an aluminium yacht mast. “What I find fascinating about boat design is that you can’t muck around … A boat has to be a boat, if it is not, it sinks. The appeal is the absolute functionality. And boats are beautiful because of that,” he told me.</p>    <p>Grimshaw’s buildings have proved both functional and impressively adaptable. The FT print building is a data centre now. Miller’s furniture factory houses several departments of Bath Spa University.</p> <p>Architecture is not an easy profession. When Grimshaw decided to stand for election as president of the Royal Academy, aged 65, he confessed that he had begun to weary of the more bureaucratic aspects of architectural practice. “I’ve been an architect for 40 years, and 80% of it is a battle. There are battles on-site, over legal issues, over financial matters, and with the client.” His spa project that was meant to be a glamorous new attraction for Bath remained empty and unused for several years because of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/5230322.stm\">legal wrangles with the contractor</a>. There were also technical and legal issues at Waterloo station. Grimshaw’s plans for remodelling the Royal College of Art had to be abandoned, even though it had planning permission, when a wealthy neighbour threatened a legal challenge that the RCA could not afford to contest.</p> <p>Grimshaw was a highly effective president of the Royal Academy from 2004, bringing calm and stability to what was then a troubled organisation. He put in place financial controls and a professional management structure. He was also generous, making use of the role to give another architect the chance to excel – he abandoned the institution’s previous over-ambitious £50m plan to integrate the former Museum of Mankind building in Burlington Gardens with the Royal Academy, <a href=\"https://www.fxdesign.co.uk/architecture-for-arts-sake-6142928/?cf-view\">clearing the way for David Chipperfield’s successful remodelling</a>.</p> <p>Grimshaw was knighted in 2002, elected as president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2004 and awarded the RIBA gold medal for architecture in 2019, the year in which he handed over the chairmanship of the practice that he had founded.</p> <p>He married Lavinia Russell in 1972, and she survives him, as do his two daughters, Isabel and Chloe. </p> <p>• Nicholas Grimshaw, architect, born 9 October 1939; died 15 September 2025</p>",

    "content": "<p>More than 100 liberal philanthropies and institutions have<a href=\"https://medium.com/@uniteinadvance/statement-on-the-fundamental-freedom-of-speech-b98c1c6db4e2\"> issued a letter </a>condemning “acts of political violence” and pre-emptively opposing an expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> crackdown on ideologically left-leaning funding in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">death of Charlie Kirk</a> last week.</p> <p>The groups, including the Ford Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, denounced the recent murders of Kirk and of Melissa Hortman in Minnesota, saying such acts “have no place in our democracy”.</p> <p>The letter – published on Medium – said: “Our country is built on the premise that everyone has the right to express themselves, even when others don’t agree with or like what they say. No one should fear for their safety simply for expressing their views.”</p> <p>It went on to warn that “organizations should not be attacked for carrying out their missions or expressing their values in support of the communities they serve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-podcast\">JD Vance threatens crackdown on ‘far-left’ groups after Charlie Kirk shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We reject attempts to exploit political violence to mischaracterize our good work or restrict our fundamental freedoms, like freedom of speech and the freedom to give. Attempts to silence speech, criminalize opposing viewpoints, and misrepresent and limit charitable giving undermine our democracy and harm all Americans.”</p> <p>The statement comes after officials in the Trump administration signaled a potential crackdown on unnamed left-leaning groups it claims promote violence and terrorism.</p> <p>Standing in as host of the Charlie Kirk Show podcast on Monday, JD Vance said that “leftwing extremism” was “part of the reason” Kirk was assassinated last week.</p> <p>“We have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of leftwing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin’s bullet,” the vice-president said.</p> <p>Vance called out the “generous tax treatment” that Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation receive, pointing to a report in the Nation, titled <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/charlie-kirk-assassination-maga/\">Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning,</a> that he claimed was used to justify Kirk’s death and part of a campaign to incite violence against conservatives.</p> <p>“I read a story in the Nation magazine about my dear friend Charlie Kirk,” Vance said during the podcast. “George Soros’ Open Society Foundation funds this magazine, as does the Ford Foundation and many other wealthy titans of the American progressive movement.”</p> <p>Elsewhere on the podcast, the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, claimed that Kirk’s final message to him called for a coordinated effort against unnamed leftwing groups accused of promoting violence. Miller pledged that the federal government would use “every available resource” to dismantle them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/15/vance-charlie-kirk-podcast-episode/\">A senior White House official told the Washington Post</a> it was compiling a list of “leftwing organizations” that it says are linked to political violence but had not decided on what actions it may seek to take.</p> <p>Bhaskar Sunkara, the president of the Nation, <a href=\"https://x.com/sunraysunray/status/1967657717348360234\">said</a> on X that the publication had never received funds from the Open Society Foundations. Both the Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation said they do not currently fund the Nation. A spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations called Vance’s accusations “disgraceful” and said the group’s work was “entirely peaceful and lawful”.</p> <p>The author of the opinion piece, Elizabeth Spiers, later said her article “explicitly stated that no one should ever be killed for their views” and suggested Vance either misunderstood her piece or was deliberately misrepresenting her words.</p> <p>In her article, Spiers described Kirk as “an unrepentant racist, transphobe, homophobe, and misogynist who often wrapped his bigotry in Bible verses because there was no other way to pretend that it was morally correct”.</p> <p>The dispute comes as the administration seeks to bind itself tightly to Kirk’s legacy. Trump, Vance and the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, are expected to travel to Arizona for Kirk’s stadium-set memorial service on Sunday.</p> <p>The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, are also expected to attend.</p> <p>The letter published on Wednesday now seeks to defuse the conflict between the administration and progressive philanthropies and non-profits by joining together to form a collective front that has eluded other institutions and businesses, including universities and law firms, that have come under administration pressure.</p> <p>Signatories to the letter, include the MacArthur Foundation; the Knight Foundation; the Omidyar Network, funded by the eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar; and the Schmidt Family Foundation, supported by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.</p> <p>“At a moment that is fragile and fraught, we must rise to the higher standard we all collectively desire,” the letter concluded.</p> <p>“Now is a moment for leadership that drives unity rather than sows further division. Our organizations will continue focusing on helping people across all backgrounds, geographies, ideologies, and belief systems, to heal, thrive, and live peacefully together, protected by the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Eoin Hayes TD apologised for ‘huge mistake’ of dressing up as Barack Obama at 2009 Halloween party</p>",
    "content": "<p>A member of Ireland’s parliament who was pictured in blackface at a 2009 Halloween party will stay on as a member of the Social Democrats, the party leader has said, citing his “unreserved” apology and the fact that the incident took place 16 years ago.</p> <p>Eoin Hayes, a deputy (TD) for Dublin Bay South, came under fire this week after media published pictures of him dressed up as the then US president, Barack Obama, at a party. At the time, Hayes was the president of the students’ union at University College Cork.</p> <p>Hayes issued a statement on social media late on Monday after learning that the pictures were to be published. He said he had worn makeup on his face and hands while dressing up as Obama.</p> <p>“While I didn’t have an understanding of how hurtful it was at the time, I came to recognise that in the intervening years and I am so profoundly sorry,” he said. “What I did was completely inappropriate and a huge mistake.”</p> <p>He stressed that the costume was not meant to mock Obama, describing the US president as someone whom he “greatly admired”, and noting that he had gone on to work for Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the leader of the Social Democrats, Holly Cairns, said she hoped to put the issue behind the party. “There’s no way to sugarcoat it, I’m hugely disappointed and annoyed about this situation,” she <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/22544461/\">told the broadcaster RTÉ, </a>citing the many issues that she and others in the centre-left party would have preferred to focus on.</p> <p>She said, however, that she would not move to expel Hayes from the party. “If this had happened last week or even last year, I think it’s very clear he would no longer be a Social Democrats TD,” she said. “The fact that this happened 16 years ago is a very different situation.”</p> <p>Hayes had offered an “unreserved apology”, she added. “But I want to be really clear that blackface is a form of racism. It was then, it is now.”</p> <p>It was the second time Hayes had come under fire after a November general election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/02/ireland-election-2024-latest-results\">that saw</a> the Social Democrats energised under the new leadership of Cairns. In December, he was <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2024/1210/1485698-eoin-hayes-soc-dems/\">indefinitely suspended</a> from the party after he inaccurately said he had sold the shares he held in his former employer Palantir Technologies, which has ties to the US military and Israel, before entering politics. He was readmitted to the party in July.</p> <p>While this week’s apology was welcomed by Mamobo Ogoro, one of Ireland’s leading voices on diversity, she called for it to be paired with action. “The apology here was fine – acceptable – but what are we going to do to actually dismantle racism as a whole?” Ogoro said on social media.</p> <p>The pictures had resurfaced at a time when there were “racist attacks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/10/violent-attacks-ireland-indian-immigrants\">going on</a> in the streets, where there’s people being abused on the daily, when there are migrant communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/ireland-housing-crisis-far-right-europe-refugees\">being</a> scapegoated”, she said.</p> <p>She called on Hayes to heighten his apology by listening and engaging with those who have been on the receiving end of racism. “Part of it … is how he can use his power, how the party can use their power to influence positive change.”</p>",

    "content": "<h2><strong>HEROES AND VILLANS</strong></h2> <p>A year ago to the day, Aston Villa’s 2024-25 Bigger Cup adventure – one that would take them to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/aston-villa-psg-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report\">mesmeric quarter-final with eventual winners PSG</a> – started with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/17/young-boys-aston-villa-champions-league-match-report\">a 3-0 victory over Young Boys</a>, a performance with more fluidity than a Jamie Carragher drive-by and the Birmingham side’s first game back in Europe’s elite club competition in 41 years. In the next round of Bigger Cup fixtures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/aston-villa-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">Bayern Munich were duly dispatched by Villa</a> in a performance with more fluidity than a Bavarian title parade. Unai Emery could seemingly do no wrong and had everything from Jhon Durán’s left foot to John McGinn’s backside marching to the beat of his drum, with his team and tactics looking more fluid in the season’s early stages than Ozzy Osbourne’s long locks gently rocking in the soft Birmingham breeze (OK, that’s enough – Football Daily Ed).</p> <p>Fast forward to September 2025 and while most of our attention on Tuesday night was on the bright lights of Bigger Cup, a few savvy onlookers may have noticed Villa scrapping at a bus stop in Hounslow, as Emery’s side continued their dreadful start to this season by going out of Fizzy Cup with a whimper after a penalty shootout defeat at Brentford. On the plus side, Villa did actually score a goal – which is more than can be said for the other four games this season – even if Harvey Elliott’s opener had less to do with dynamic, incisive play and more to do with a botched Brentford backpass and a goalkeeper howler. But after becoming the latest victims of the long throw’s renaissance, with Aaron Hickey bringing the Bees level in the second half, a strong Villa side that featured nearly all of their best players were left to lick their wounds, exiting a very winnable competition in the second round and leaving Emery in something of a pickle.</p> <p>“I think we’re getting better – there’s still work to do and we’re going to practice,” roared Emery after the Brentford defeat, somewhat reassuringly. “We used in the starting XI some players who joined us in the last moments of the transfer window. They need minutes to get confidence and feel comfortable in our structure, trying to adapt as soon as possible. The press we did with McGinn was really fantastic, and then in 90 minutes we created three or four clear chances and even hit the post with Jadon Sancho.” Which is a very positive way of saying nine other outfield Villa players <em>did not</em> press and certainly a good way to put a shine on a Sancho miss that should have been a simple back-post tap-into an empty net rather than a careful sidefoot on to the outside of Brentford’s post.</p> <p>Villa fans have not yet resorted to smuggling large arrows into the away end and pointing them at the opposition’s goal, but another blank at Sunderland on Sunday will certainly turn the pressure up on Emery. What a difference a year makes.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Simon Burnton at 8pm (all times BST) for Bigger Cup updates on Liverpool 3-1 Atlético Madrid, while Luke McLaughlin will be on hand at the same time for Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don’t want to talk about a single player but of course if you sub somebody at half-time you are not pleased with his performance. I will talk to him in person and then it’s up to him to show improvement.

Whether a particular fixture confirms their own team as crowned champions of Europe is maybe for most fans not of great import. I presume most followers of the ‘whipping-boy chaff’ go for the love of their team and some maybe even for the love of the game. Whilst no doubt generating a fat load of dosh, Uefa’s ‘Swiss Model’ also allows fans to watch more football and see their team play more other teams. Is this such a bad thing? Even if this means enduring ‘meaningless’ fixtures such as last night’s mind-numbing dead-rubber between Juventus and Borussia Dortmund. I also presume that the legendary Algerian goalkeeper Albert Camus enjoyed playing in goal for Racing Universitaire d’Alger, even though he was convinced that life was entirely devoid of meaning” – John Waugh.</p> </blockquote>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kevin Mac Allister (aka Alexis Mac Allister’s brother) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/16/champions-league-roundup-juventus-dortmund-4-4-qarabag-union-saint-gilloise-benfica-psv\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/16/champions-league-roundup-juventus-dortmund-4-4-qarabag-union-saint-gilloise-benfica-psv\">scoring the winner</a> for Union Saint-Gilloise away at PSV gives me the excuse to bring out one of my favourite, pointless pieces of trivia. He is named after the Kevin McCallister character in Home Alone played by Macaulay Culkin but he wasn’t aware of it and used to joke about the coincidence whenever it was mentioned, until he found out from his parents when he was 18 that he actually was named after him. To quote the great Philip Larkin, ‘They mess* you up, your mum and dad.’ The language has been changed as the original is far too rude, but Larkin was bang on …” – Noble Francis.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Re: ‘There’s a tradition in the Mediterranean, especially in Greece and Cyprus, of doing some olive oil really early in the season.

    "content": "<p>Before his fatal shooting, few if any of the leaders of Europe’s resurgent far right had so much as mentioned the name of Charlie Kirk. Since last week, the propaganda potential of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">conservative US activist’s killing</a> has escaped none of them.</p> <p>Kirk, a rising star of Donald Trump’s Maga movement, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">hit in the neck by a single bullet</a> as he addressed students in Utah on 10 September. A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/charlie-kirk-suspect-texts-evidence\">has been charged</a>, but his alleged motives remain unclear.</p> <p>But that has not stopped far-right figureheads from across the continent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/europe-far-right-leaders-charlie-kirk-shooting-turning-point-usa\">seizing on the killing</a> to attack “the left”, presenting Kirk’s death as the logical conclusion of what they portray as a long-running hate campaign aimed at silencing them.</p> <p>“We must stop the hate-mongering left!” <a href=\"https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1966045730503598206\">said Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orbán</a>. Santiago Abascal of Spain’s Vox went further: “Censorship isn’t enough for them – so they resort to murder.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/J_Bardella/status/1965869311928779259\">For Jordan Bardella of France’s far-right National Rally</a> (RN), the “dehumanising rhetoric of the left and its intolerance … fuels political violence”. Alice Weidel of Germany’s AfD said Kirk had been shot by “a fanatic who hates our way of life”.</p> <p>The objective, experts say, is to raise Kirk to the status of a martyr to the conservative cause, and a victim of liberal-progressive persecution – simultaneously lending greater legitimacy to the right’s positions, and inflicting damage on the left.</p> <p>“Martyrdom is a social operation to transform a morally and socially unacceptable act of violence into a narrative,” historian <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2025/09/12/charlie-kirk-martyr-de-l-extreme-droite-europeenne_6640622_3210.html\">Pierre-Marie Delpu told Le Monde</a>. “Here, the far right is constructing a plot and a persecution, with one executioner: the left.”</p> <p>Some on Europe’s far right<strong> </strong>were disarmingly open about the business of capitalising on the killing. “We should not be ashamed of ‘politicising [Kirk’s] death’ – or putting a tragedy to good use,” urged Damien Rieu, an adviser to Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal.</p> <p>In the European parliament, the ultranationalist Europe of Sovereign Nations group, which includes AfD and France’s Reconquête, nominated Kirk for the Sakharov prize, awarded annually for “the defence of human rights and fundamental liberties”.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Mobilising the base</strong></p>    <p>At a far-right gathering hosted by Vox in Madrid last weekend, a stirring video tribute to Kirk wowed the audience. To loud cheers, <a href=\"https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/abascal-they-do-not-kill-us-for-being-fascists-they-call-us-fascists-in-order-to-kill-us/\">Abascal told</a> an estimated 8,500 people that the left “do not kill us for being fascists – they call us fascists in order to kill us”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/AndreCVentura/status/1967318894827442217\">André Ventura of Portugal’s Chega said</a> the killing showed “arguing over ideas” had given way to “hatred, persecution and murder”. Italy’s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.agenzianova.com/news/meloni-il-sacrificio-di-kirk-dimostra-da-che-parte-sta-la-violenza-gli-estremisti-non-ci-fermeranno/?utm_source=euractiv&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=In+the+capital&amp;utm_term=0-0&amp;utm_campaign=EN_THE_CAPITALS\">Giorgia Meloni, told the rally</a> that Kirk’s “sacrifice … shows us once again which side the violence and intolerance are on … We will continue to fight tirelessly for our people’s freedom.”</p> <p>In London, the 110,000 to 150,000 people who attended Tommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” protest on Saturday – including far-right figures from France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Germany – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-london-transatlantic\">held a minute’s silence for their hero</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A continent on the march</strong></p> <p>This all might matter less if Europe’s far right were not already on the march. Populist and far-right parties are in government in Italy, Hungary, Belgium and Slovakia, and the most popular parties in France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the UK.</p> <p>In Finland and Croatia they are signed-up members of conservative-led coalitions, and in Sweden they are lending parliamentary support to another. In Spain, Vox is surging in the polls and in Portugal, Chega is in the lead ahead of local elections.</p> <p>In German regional elections in North Rhine-Westphalia last Saturday, AfD was well beaten by chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right CDU and his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners – but the far-right party succeeded in almost tripling its vote.</p> <p>More insidiously, hardline far-right policies – on immigration, Islam, the green agenda, EU integration, traditional values – are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/vicious-cycle-far-right-parties-across-europe-are-inspiring-imitators\">becoming normalised across Europe</a> as mainstream parties ape them in a vain attempt to maintain their vote shares.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Holding the line</strong></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2025/09/16/nathalie-loiseau-eurodeputee-apres-l-assassinat-de-charlie-kirk-il-y-a-des-silences-qui-en-disent-plus-que-de-longs-discours_6641418_3232.html\">a passionate op-ed for Le Monde</a>, the French MEP and former European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau – who received death threats after objecting to the far right’s calls for a minute’s silence for Kirk – said that while Kirk’s killing was an abomination, he had “glorified racial segregation and slavery, demanded women return to the home, demonised homosexuality, blamed Jews for promoting immigration … and compared abortion to the Holocaust”.</p> <p>She was, she said, the only one of 720 MEPs “to speak out and demand that a distinction be made between the unanimous condemnation we should all express in the face of a man’s assassination, and the refusal to endorse his ideas”.</p> <p>In the present circumstances, Loiseau said, resisting the concerted call for Kirk’s martyrdom – “keeping our heads, remaining true to what we are” – is of paramount importance.</p> <p>Because “it is not respect for the dead they demand; it’s the right to insult and hate the living who do not resemble them … It is not freedom of speech they defend, it is the normalisation of their extremism.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/17/jess-cartner-morley-fashion-why-september-ideal-time-update-your-look",
    "description": "<p>This is a powerful month for fashion, and an ideal time to try a waistcoat, wider trousers, a shorter skirt or a splash of saturated colour</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Every day is all there is”, as Joan Didion put it, rather elegantly. The words are so smoothly balanced you can turn them over in your mind like a pebble, and the phrase popped into my head the other day when I was thinking about why September is such a powerful month for fashion. September, the saying goes, is January for fashion people. This is sunrise for new trends, high noon for shopping, peak season for glossy magazines packed with breathless style instruction. It is the point in the calendar when an update of what you wear suddenly feels urgent.</p> <p>This seems, on the surface, like odd timing. After all, once you get to be an adult, nothing much happens in September. It’s not much of a season for parties, or for family holidays. Just the muscle memory of school days makes this the moment to lock back into the routine, the nine-to-five, the tea-bath-bed. But&nbsp;that’s the point. September is all&nbsp;about the everyday.</p> <p>This is what Didion was getting at: that everyday is everything, and therefore worth giving your all to. This&nbsp;is about the stuff that is obviously important – about bringing your best self to your home life, your work, your relationships – but it’s also about the little stuff, too. Style is one of the little ways to elevate the everyday, to make it matter, to take pride in it. Wearing a&nbsp;nice outfit, putting out candles for dinner, a nicely wrapped birthday gift. Not because you have to, but because you and your life are worth it.</p> <p>It shouldn’t be a chore, which is where new season wardrobe updates come in, to freshen things up. Have you done a waistcoat yet? If not, this is your moment. They are brilliant on their own as a sleeveless top – the structure and buttons bring polish – and useful as an alternative to a light jacket, worn open over a shirt. (You want the boxy kind that has breadth at the shoulder, not the snooker-player version that makes bra straps an issue.)</p>    <p>But it is often what you wear on your bottom half that makes the difference between an outfit that looks contemporary and one that looks dated. An airy trouser that doesn’t hug your legs should be the linchpin of your autumn wardrobe. Or, consider a&nbsp;shorter skirt: the miniskirt revival, that began on the catwalks straight after the pandemic, has slowly grown into a real-world phenomenon. I’m not suggesting we go in on those minuscule micro ra-ra numbers the tweens and teens are doing, but if you are still in a calf-grazing hemline, it’s time to dig out the knee-length and shorter skirts lurking in your wardrobe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I am thrilled about. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After decades of athleisure and streetwear, style has shifted to a more grownup place recently. The details that once seemed dull and fusty – leather belts, ribbed socks – are now the pieces that will put you back at the leading edge. Instead of layering a&nbsp;hoodie under a blazer, try draping a&nbsp;sweater in a contrasting colour around your shoulders: the silhouette is similar, the comfort-level is consistent, but the effect is much more now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\">Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: Forget date night – I’d much rather dress up to party with my friends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Colour is back, too. The era of “quiet luxury” threw a blanket of beige over fashion for a couple of years, but rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I&nbsp;for one am thrilled about. Wearing beige every day was like living on nothing but Rich Tea biscuits: comforting and easy for a bit, but then boring and probably not doing us any favours. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious right now. Miuccia Prada, who never gets this stuff wrong, put copper and pink together at Miu Miu and paired tomato with plum at Prada.</p> <p>Making an effort doesn’t have to mean looking serious, by the way. If&nbsp;you are finding it hard to break out of wearing sweats, try a soft cotton rugby shirt in a bold stripe, untucked over wide trousers. It is about looking intentional, not about looking formal. Layer two different length necklaces over a sweater, or pin a vintage brooch to your lapel. Tiny gestures like this dignify dull days. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, and all that. Summer is over, but the spirit of September can bring the sunshine back.</p> <p><em>Model: Ellen at Body London.

    "title": "Now the UN says Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, too. How can western governments still refuse to act? | Steve Crawshaw",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/un-report-israel-genocide-gaza-western-governments",
    "description": "<p>The UN commission of inquiry’s report makes it almost impossible for Israel – and its allies – to maintain the narrative that criticism of it is part of an antisemitic plot</p>",
    "content": "<p>The conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry\">Israel has committed genocide</a> in the war in Gaza, and that its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli leaders are responsible for inciting that genocide, changes little in legal terms. The international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague has yet to issue its final ruling in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/how-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-played-out-in-the-hague\">the genocide case that South Africa</a> brought against Israel last year.</p> <p>Politically, however, this <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf\">latest report</a> (officially a “conference room paper”, intended to aid discussion of the themes) may prove to be one of the final nails in the coffin of the shameless but still-continuing narrative from Netanyahu and his allies that any talk of Israeli crimes is part of an antisemitic plot – or, to use Netanyahu’s favourite phrase, “a <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-office-calls-gaza-famine-declaration-a-modern-blood-libel/\">blood libel</a>”.</p> <p>The commission of inquiry’s findings now stand alongside those of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/\">Amnesty International</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza\">Human Rights Watch</a> and the respected Israeli groups <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide\">B’Tselem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.phr.org.il/en/genocide-in-gaza-eng/\">Physicians for Human Rights–Israel</a>, who have all published authoritative and detailed reports concluding that Israel is committing genocide in the two years since the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023. UN experts and <a href=\"https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IAGS-Resolution-on-Gaza-FINAL.pdf\">genocide scholars</a> have reached the same conclusion.</p> <p>Even when so many have already spoken, however, a UN commission of inquiry brings a particular stamp of authority. The chair of the commission on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/opinion/un-palestinians-israel-gaza-genocide.html\">Navi Pillay</a>, a former president of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. When I first met her, she was a respected UN high commissioner for human rights – not exactly a “Hamas proxy”, to quote Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva when he accused the authors of the report of a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/un-commission-of-inquiry-report-israel-gaza-legal-analysis-genocide-accusation\">libellous rant</a>”.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s government has previously said it cannot talk of genocide until “<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/gaza-minister-for-the-middle-east-statement-14-may-2025\">a competent court</a>” (in other words, the ICJ) has given its final judgment. The commission’s findings make clear that line is wholly unsustainable for the prime minister formerly known as a human rights lawyer. “Prevention of genocide” is – as Starmer well knows – a key element of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf\">the 1948 genocide convention</a>; the president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars is one of many who have pointed out that states are <a href=\"https://opiniojuris.org/2025/08/04/is-genocide-happening-in-gaza/\">already failing</a> in that regard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/labour-genocide-gaza-british-palestinians-fighter-jets\">If Labour admitted there is a genocide in Gaza, it would have to admit its own hand in it | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The commission’s conclusions expose the moral failure of states that were rightly proud to create the <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/ICCAtAGlanceENG.pdf\">international criminal court</a> (ICC) in Rome in 1998 but now seek to undermine the rulings of that same court (the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals, while the ICJ addresses the responsibilities of states, including on genocide). The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/merz-invites-netanyahu-to-germany-despite-icc-arrest-warrant/a-71788069\">said it would be “absurd</a>” to detain Netanyahu, despite the arrest warrant that judges unanimously approved for the Israeli leader for alleged crimes against humanity. France insisted it <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/11/27/france-says-immunities-apply-to-netanyahu-regarding-icc-arrest-warrant_6734304_4.html\">would be inappropriate to arrest Netanyahu</a> if he came to Paris (despite applauding the earlier arrest warrant for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin).</p> <p>The commission of inquiry’s conclusion that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu and his government are committing genocide means that governments’ continued refusal to cooperate with the ICC, and refusal to execute its arrest warrants for crimes against humanity, is illogical and dangerous. As part of the Donald Trump-Netanyahu axis of impunity and their shared determination to destroy the ICC, Trump has imposed sanctions on ICC prosecutors, judges and others – including, most recently, on Al-Haq and other respected <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/sanctioning-foreign-ngos-directly-engaged-in-iccs-illegitimate-targeting-of-israel\">Palestinian human rights groups</a> whose only crime is to have documented the crimes committed by others.</p> <p>An experienced former British military prosecutor was eventually forced to resign from his post as principal trial lawyer at the ICC after death threats and more, saying this had been “<a href=\"https://observer.co.uk/news/international/article/threat-of-us-sanctions-over-gaza-forced-me-out-says-icc-lawyer\">the worst few months of my life</a>”. Investigations by the Israeli-Palestinian <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/icc-israel-surveillance-investigation/\">+972 Magazine,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/28/israeli-spy-chief-icc-prosecutor-war-crimes-inquiry\">Guardian</a> and others have revealed the extraordinary lengths that Netanyahu has been ready to go to, including alleged phone taps and attempted blackmail, in order to sabotage the court’s work.</p> <p>The crimes against humanity that Netanyahu stands accused of at the ICC should in any case not be seen as a lesser crime than genocide. Crimes against humanity – which include <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rome-Statute-eng.pdf\">apartheid, extermination and forcible transfer of population</a> – differ from genocide not by being less serious but only because of the “special intent” that forms part of genocide.</p> <p>Britain, France, Canada and others are all <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10323/\">due to recognise Palestinian statehood</a> next week, following 147 countries which have already done so. Together with the latest genocide findings, that will add to the pressure on Netanyahu, who admits <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-isolation-intl\">how isolated his country</a> has now become.</p> <p>But the recognition of Palestine by a handful more countries is not enough. There must be consequences for the crimes committed, too – no matter whether those accused of committing the crimes are considered friend or foe. Starmer and other European leaders have rightly been ready to face Trump down in the context of the US president’s dangerous love-in with Putin. But the destruction of the ICC would have incalculable consequences. Once crushed, the court could never be put back together again. Starmer needs to confront Trump directly on these themes this week; the trampling of justice can’t be left to one side, any more than Trump’s earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/ukraine-us-minerals-deal\">humiliation of Ukraine’s president</a>, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, could be ignored.</p> <p>To quote Tom Fletcher, the former UK ambassador to Beirut and now UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, events in Gaza are a “21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness”. Echoing the earlier words of the international court of justice, Fletcher called on governments to “<a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/news/un-relief-chief-calls-security-council-act-decisively-prevent-genocide-gaza\">prevent genocide</a>”.

    "content": "<p>USA’s Katie Moon leapt to gold in Tokyo on Wednesday in a thrilling final to become the first woman to win three successive pole vault titles at the World Athletics Championships.</p> <p>Moon has fond memories of Japan – she won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. This time she edged out compatriot Sandi Morris with a final successful leap at a season’s best 4.90m.</p> <p>Morris, a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, placed second on 4.85m, while Slovenia’s Tina Sutej took bronze at 4.80m. Morris has now finished second in four world championships, as she searches for her first outdoor world title.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/jake-wightman-pipped-on-line-isaac-nader-surges-1500m-world-athletics-championship-gold\">Jake Wightman pipped on line as Isaac Nader surges to 1500m World Championship gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 34-year-old Moon is the oldest woman to win a world championship pole vault title. She has said she has ambitions of competing in a home Olympics, at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, but admitted competing at the highest level is getting tougher.</p> <p>“They’re all special, but I think the older you get, it gets harder,” Moon said on Wednesday. “So to be able to come in here and not just win but to jump [4.90m], I don’t know how many years of that I’ve got in me.”</p> <p>Morris, meanwhile, said she had mixed feelings about another silver medal.</p> <p>“I’ve made it through injuries, I’ve overcome so much over the last few years, I’ve sacrificed so much just to get back to this place,” Morris said. “So, sure, it’s bittersweet, walking away with another silver. But there’s a lot worse things in the world than silver medals at the world championships.”</p>    <p>The contest for gold looked to be between Moon and Morris from the early stages, the two Americans being alone in clearing the first three heights up to 4.75m on their first attempts. Only two others in the field eventually cleared the height.</p> <p>Morris gave Moon a run for her money in the absence of Australia’s Nina Kennedy, the Paris Olympic gold medallist who had pulled out days before the worlds due to a leg injury. Kennedy had shared the last world championship gold with Moon in Budapest.</p> <p>With the first four heights cleared at the first attempt, Moon got the first edge on Morris, only to have the tables turned when Morris raised the bar to 4.85m and cleared at the first attempt.</p> <p>After failing on her first attempt at that height, Moon went all or nothing by taking her next attempt at 4.90m, which she managed on her final attempt. Morris failed twice at 4.90m, and then with a last hail-mary attempt at 4.95m, to end up second yet again.</p> <p>Moon had an attempt at the 5.01m championship record set by Russia’s Yelena Isinbayeva in 2005, but ran through and decided to celebrate the win.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Determined to get a good spot on Whitehall, the woman from Liverpool had woken her nieces at 3am to travel to London. Her dedication paid off. By the time the march reached her on Saturday afternoon, she was sitting on a wall outside Downing Street, the little girls in camping chairs at her feet, engrossed in their iPads.</p> <p>She had unfurled two banners. One said “Keir Starmer is a wanker” and the other read: “We’re not far right, we are England’s mothers and we will not stay silent. Stop the rape of our children, mothers across Britain are taking a stand.”</p> <p>I asked her why she was there and she looked incredulous. Wasn’t it obvious? “Because Keir Starmer’s a wanker.” Why? “He’s taking our speech away.” Even though you’re allowed to sit outside his house and call him a wanker? <em>“</em>Well he is.”</p> <p>As for the other sign, she made it, she said, “because I’m not far right and I’m sick of being called it. I’m sick of coming to places like this and being called far right. I am here for the right reasons today, for the future of these children. People are coming in illegally and raping our kids and it’s got to stop<em>.”</em></p> <p>I went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/who-were-the-key-figures-at-the-unite-the-kingdom-rally-in-london\">Tommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rally</a> on Saturday to record an episode of the Guardian’s daily podcast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/sep/16/on-the-ground-with-tommy-robinsons-new-supporters-podcast\">Today in Focus</a>. Robinson called it “the biggest freedom of speech” rally in British history. Others, like Hope Not Hate, prefer to <a href=\"https://hopenothate.org.uk/2025/09/13/britains-biggest-far-right-protest-more-than-100000-attend-tommy-robinsons-unite-the-kingdom-rally/\">describe it as</a> “Britain’s largest ever far-right protest”. Unsurprisingly – with the exception of one jovial Welshman who said “well, my views <em>are</em> far right” – no one I met thinks of themselves in that way. “We’re just right,<em>” </em>I heard, over and over. As in: correct.</p> <p>There is no doubt that many of the speakers at the rally were racist, with many delivering variations on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/a-deadly-ideology-how-the-great-replacement-theory-went-mainstream\">“great replacement” conspiracy theory</a>. Robinson told the crowd: “It’s not just Britain that is being invaded, it’s not just Britain that is being raped. Every single western nation faces the same problem: an orchestrated, organised invasion and replacement of European citizens is happening.”</p> <p>But most of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/13/uk-politics-latest-news-unite-the-kingdom-march-far-right-rally-london-labour-keir-starmer\">110,000 marchers</a> couldn’t hear the speeches. Many couldn’t even fit on to Whitehall to see the big screens. I didn’t get the impression they were there for the speakers anyway: this was about being heard themselves.</p> <p>A few wore their racism with pride, like the man with the misspelled sign that read: “Why are white people dispised when our tax money pays for everything.” But mostly these were “ordinary people” with “ordinary jobs” who “care about our kids”, who said time and again that they’d “had enough”. Usually it was about immigration. But often it wasn’t just that. They’d had enough of a Britain they felt was no longer working.</p> <p>Instead of blaming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jun/28/how-the-unforced-error-of-tory-austerity-wrecked-britain\">years of Tory austerity</a>, or a capitalist system rigged against the little guy, for these people, “illegal immigrants” were to blame. And Starmer was the bogeyman. “Look what he’s done to the farmers, inheritance tax, you know, the NHS is down on its knees,” said a man from Norfolk. “We have potholes in the roads, we can’t get GP appointments, people are actually left in the hallways of some of the NHS hospitals and are not seen to for hours and they’re in critical condition. This country is becoming a joke.”</p> <p>For him it was personal: “I’m starting to lose my teeth, right, because I’m a type 1 diabetic. And it’s the struggle of me trying to get my teeth replaced because of my diabetes. They don’t help people like me. But they would help someone that steps foot on our land from a dinghy and gets everything.”</p> <p>No one used the words “asylum seeker” or “refugee”. It was “illegals” and “fighting age men”. All tarred with the actions of a tiny number of people, like the man in the Bell Hotel in Epping, who was convicted of touching a teenage girl.</p> <p>Everyone claimed that they didn’t have a problem with <em>legal</em> immigration: the millions of people who have come to the UK with visas, to study or work. They weren’t blamed for putting pressure on services. Just the people who arrived on small boats – who made up just 4% of arrivals in 2024.</p> <p>I left the rally when too many people on Whitehall were getting aggy and I realised the police had shut off all the side roads, making a quick escape impossible. Since leaving I’ve been grappling with how best to describe what I saw and heard. It was a far-right rally, yes, but many people attended unperturbed by the fact it had been billed as such by many media outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">including the Guardian</a>. They did not feel alienated by such an extreme, and previously fringe, label. In his speech, Robinson said something that I fear may be true. “They tried to silence us for 20 years with labels,” he said. “‘Racist’, ‘Islamophobe’, ‘far right’. They don’t work any more!” </p> <p>When the far right becomes the mainstream right, what language do we have to describe what is happening? How have conditions led to so many feeling unheard, frustrated and angry? Until the foundations of Britain are fixed – the NHS, schools, potholes, fuel prices – I can’t see this movement doing anything other than growing.</p> <ul> <li><p>Helen Pidd is a presenter of Today in Focus, the Guardian’s award-winning daily podcast</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>This week, the Bureau of Statistics realised its latest series of <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/measuring-what-matters\">Measuring What Matters</a> in an attempt to assess things beyond the mere economics. It comes off the back of the bureau’s first attempt to measure productivity in the non-market sector. Both raise questions of what we value and also whether our focus is where it should be.</p> <p><a href=\"https://jimchalmers.org/latest-news/speeches/measuring-what-matters/\">In 2020 the then shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers,</a> announced an ALP government would develop a wellbeing framework that would seek to “measure what matters”. It was a worthy goal mocked by the then treasurer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/01/josh-frydenberg-urged-to-do-the-right-thing-after-offensive-hindu-comments\">Josh Frydenberg</a>.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/measuring-what-matters-report-australia-wellbeing-framework-beyond-gdp\">Patrick Commins has explained</a>, the wellbeing framework looks at a vast array of life – well beyond GDP. Unfortunately, the framework has not lived up to its promise. Rather than driving policy, it is now little more than a data dump. And unfortunately, much of it is out of date.</p> <p>For example, one measurement included is experience of discrimination. The most recent figures are from 2020, which the ABS noted are probably suspect because they were done during the period of Covid restrictions:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Proportion of people who have experienced discrimination in the previous 12 months\">  <iframe title=\"Proportion of people who have experienced discrimination in the previous 12 months\" aria-label=\"Grouped column chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-YeZls\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YeZls/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/YeZls/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>Until the government actually funds the ABS to regularly measure what matters, the wellbeing framework will be irrelevant to policy discussion.</p> <p>And measuring things matters because you can’t know what you don’t see (or count). But equally important is recognising that not everything can be measured as accurately as we might like (or suppose).</p> <p>Productivity, for example, has been the big topic of the past few months.</p> <p>It is essentially measured by GDP per hour worked. But we already know that GDP misses large swathes of the economy – it doesn’t measure housework, it doesn’t care about distribution. And yet we divide it by hours worked and, before you know it, we have <a href=\"https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/five-productivity-inquiries\">five reports</a> from the Productivity Commission, a <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/review/economic-reform-roundtable\">productivity roundtable</a> and masses of writing on the issue (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2025/jun/19/what-could-albanese-do-to-improve-productivity-here-is-a-short-non-exhaustive-list\">including by me</a>), most of which ignores that our measurement of productivity is pretty ropey.</p> <p>Given the value of a thing produced is quantified by its price, this essentially means that if you to do one activity that provides a more expensive product in the same amount of time it would be more productive to do that expensive thing.</p> <p>If we all went off to work in the mines, Australia’s productivity would increase. Would that make us a better society? I doubt it, but it is essentially the (unstated) conclusion of the <a href=\"http://www.rossgittins.com/2025/08/official-modelling-shows-little-benefit.html\">Productivity Commission’s reports</a>.</p> <p>But while productivity is easy to measure when counting goods produced, once we get to services, things get very fudgy. Service quality is hard to measure and more services in the same time is not always good.</p> <p>This is important because Australia is much more of a service economy than in the past, so measuring productivity is harder than in the past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia economy has become more service oriented\">  <iframe title=\"Australia economy has become more service orientated\" aria-label=\"Line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-SYrS2\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SYrS2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"402\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/SYrS2/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>Services are also less productive because it takes more people to do a service than it does to make a good, so again if you want to raise productivity we could just stop people doing services and get them to start making things.</p> <p>Sounds great unless you need a firefighter or a nurse or a teacher.</p> <p>These jobs come from what is classed as the “non-market” sectors of education, health and social care and public administration and safety. And those sectors have also become more prominent – not just across all work, but even within services:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"More work is done in the non-market sector than in the past\">  <iframe title=\"More work is done in the non-market sector than in the past\" aria-label=\"Line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-wwrGj\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wwrGj/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"373\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/wwrGj/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>This is a problem for measuring productivity because, while measuring services is hard, measuring non-market services is even harder because often the services are not paid and more of them might actually be worse.</p> <p>The Bureau of Statistics has for the first time attempted to count non-market productivity in the most recent GDP figures.</p> <p>It also has <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/primer-labour-productivity\">pointed out the huge difficulties</a>.</p> <p>For example, it explains that because heart surgery costs more than repairing broken bones “each open-heart surgical procedure carries more weight than each broken bone treated in the emergency room. The heart surgery costs more to perform, so it is assumed to be more valuable.”</p> <p>You can see the problem.</p> <p>If hospitals were doing more open-heart surgeries than fixing broken bones they might be more productive – but is that a good for society? Do we want policies that encourage more open-heart surgeries rather than other less productive surgeries?</p> <p>Similarly care work is counted as less productive than surgeries – but would it be good for society to encourage fewer age care workers?</p> <p>The issue is that non-market sector productivity is falling:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Productivity growth\">  <iframe title=\"Productivity growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-a0b7l\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a0b7l/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/a0b7l/?v=2\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>That is weighing down overall productivity.</p> <p>But the reality is much of the fall is just a hangover from the Covid period when there was an abnormal increase. Non-market sector productivity rarely grows much – except, as occurred in the 1990s, due to the huge IT improvements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market-sector productivity has grown much faster than the non-market sector\">  <iframe title=\"Market-sector productivity has grown much faster than the non-market sector\" aria-label=\"Line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-xArVy\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xArVy/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/xArVy/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>I am glad the ABS has taken on this unenviable task, because it highlights just how much we should not get caught up on productivity figures.</p> <p>Do we really think education and health and social care are only as good as they were 20 years ago, or that productivity in those areas is 9% lower than it was in 2021?</p> <p>And is that even bad if, for example, it means more care workers per patient?</p> <p>That’s not to say we shouldn’t improve productivity in services and the non-market sector. But what are we improving? Is our measurement of it just a good guess and not really something that matters? And is non-market sector productivity “almost” everything?</p> <p>Measuring what matters is important but also is realising that not everything we measure matters as much as we might think.</p> <p>• Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work</p>",

    "content": "<p>My grandfather was a stoic man. Settling in the western Victorian town of Ballarat upon arrival as a child from a small town in Ukraine, he took up interest in the nearest VFL club, Geelong. Thus began a lifelong affinity with the Cats he would pass down to his four sons and eight grandchildren.</p> <p>Battle-hardened by a modest upbringing, the loss of his mother at an early age and the mental scars of his service in Kokoda, football became a comforting escape from everyday life. Too frail to get to games himself, his lounge room and pay TV were always open to watch games, where most weekends, I would join him. Mostly, he sat silently, absorbed in his favourite armchair, oblivious to the world around him – including, much to her annoyance, my grandmother.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/afl-finals-geelong-cats-v-hawthorn-hawks-preliminary-final-guide\">AFL finals: where the Geelong v Hawthorn preliminary final will be won and lost | Martin Pegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But having lived through the entirety of Geelong’s 44-year premiership drought – including five grand final losses – he was somewhat of a harsh critic. At a Shabbat dinner in mid-2007, days after the Cats had piled on 35 goals to demolish Richmond by 157 points, he boldly declared: “They’ll have to play a lot better than that to win this weekend.”</p> <p>Not only did they win that weekend, Geelong went on to break that premiership drought in emphatic fashion. My grandfather was never really one for big celebrations or overly expressive emotions, more one to sit back with a wry smile. But he got a lot of quiet joy from 2007. It was the first of three flags won in five years.</p> <p>My grandfather passed away on the eve of the 2009 finals series. He had lived long enough to see the drought-breaker, but also a shock 2008 grand final loss to Hawthorn. Five weeks after his passing, a magical toe-poke from Matthew Scarlett and the deadly boot of Paul Chapman delivered us redemption. I was 14 years old when that era of success began. My grandfather was 86. Later this year, I’ll turn 33. The eldest of my grandfather’s great-grandchildren – named after him – will turn 13 and celebrate his barmitzvah.</p>    <p>So little has remained constant in the past two decades. The AFL has expanded. Teams have risen and fallen. Australia has changed government three times and prime ministers seven. Wars have begun and ended. A pandemic plunged us in and out of lockdowns. But Geelong in the deep end of finals remained a constant through it all. So much of my own life changed too – I graduated from high school and university, changed jobs and careers, moved to Canberra and back, fell in and out of love – but my football team’s success followed me throughout.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>This weekend, Geelong enters a 15th preliminary final in 21 years, hoping to make it a seventh grand final and a fifth premiership in that time. Having comfortably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">dispatched with the reigning premiers two weeks ago</a>, they are now clear flag favourites – though that is never a guarantee of success.</p> <p>The other clubs in this weekend’s prelims are no strangers to modern success either. Brisbane and Hawthorn match Geelong with four premierships since the turn of the century, while Collingwood have two. But Geelong stands alone in refusing to bottom out at any point in that period. Missing finals just twice since 2007, making the final four in 70% of those seasons – they have made a mockery of the AFL’s equalisation agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/from-the-pocket-they-may-be-old-but-scott-pendleburys-collingwood-are-wily-and-hungry\">From the Pocket: they may be old but Scott Pendlebury’s Collingwood are wily and hungry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It speaks to the bold drive of the Cats’ machine, led by a coach who has made it a mission to rebuild on the run and to compete at the deep end every year. Chris Scott inherited a successful team, winning a flag in his first season, but he quickly set out to build an empire of his own. Still, there was a period where even us Cats fans began to doubt the wisdom of his refusal to bottom out. Surely it was only a matter of time before reality hit. But his second premiership in 2022 put those doubts to bed. It provided conclusive proof that the endeavour was worthwhile. It cemented his legacy and that of his mission. He is now rightly regarded as one of the all-time greats.</p> <p>To follow Geelong in these times is a privilege. It invites admiration and jealousy from those who can only dream of a fraction of our success. How is it still going, many wonder. We no longer ask questions. The doubt is gone. Our faith in Scott is absolute. Even the losses do not sting like they used to – there is always next week, or next year. If that used to be false hope, it is now well founded belief.</p> <p>In these uncertain times of global instability, rising extremism, war and violence, sport is as important an escape as ever. For my grandfather, that escape carried more disappointment than fulfilment. For me, it has become the opposite – reliable salvation from the horrors of the world and the pitfalls of everyday life. As we live out this fantastical sporting ride, I wonder what he might have made of the last two decades. I suppose he’d have been steadfast as ever – they’ll need to play better this week to win. To keep striving to be better. Perhaps he saw what was coming in the school of Scott after all.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After a long struggle with her health, Mum died in Auckland in 2012. At the end of her funeral service a blackbird (<em>Turdus merula</em>) flew inside the church. It fluttered and hopped about her coffin, which was laid on the floor in front of the altar on a beautiful Tongan tapa cloth. The blackbird lingered next to Mum for some time, then flew back out the open doors.</p> <p>I stayed at my sister Lisa’s home for a week after the funeral. The morning after the ceremony, a blackbird appeared in the back yard. I noticed it as I sat outside. It stayed around for a few days, sometimes perched in the sunshine on a brown wooden fence, often poking around for insects in the new spring grass. Those days were warm, still and quiet – far from how I felt. I found solace in the blackbird.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/australian-bird-of-the-year-2025-glossy-black-cockatoo-losing-habitat-trees\">Australia’s quietest cockatoo is running out of trees. We have betrayed its gentle curiosity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some Māori believe that, when they die, their spirit travels up New Zealand to the tip of the North Island – to Cape Reinga/Te Rerenga Wairua, “the leaping-off place of spirits”. From here, where the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific Ocean, spirits begin their journey to the afterlife in their ancestral home of Hawaiki. Those travelling souls are compared to the kuaka/<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/28/high-flying-life-of-australias-birds-revealed-in-new-detail-thanks-to-weather-radars\">bar-tailed godwit</a> (<em>Limosa lapponica</em>), which fly non-stop from Alaska to New Zealand and Australia.</p>    <p>For Māori, the arrival of the godwits in spring and their departure at the end of summer were a source of mystery. Then unaware that the birds bred in the Alaska tundra, the intrigue prompted the sayings: <em>Kua kite te kohanga kuaka?</em> Who has seen the nest of the kuaka? <em>Ko wai ka kite I te hua o te kuaka? </em>Who has ever held the egg of the kuaka?</p> <p>After a few days the blackbird disappeared. Each morning I’d look for it, hopeful. But nothing. I told my sister about the bird, sharing what I’d seen, how I’d felt. It’s good to talk. Lisa had noticed our fleeting visitor too, and she had also linked its presence back to the church.</p> <p>Together we sometimes reminisce about that blackbird. To us it was Mum, staying on a little longer. We laugh too, relieved that Lisa’s black cat, an adept hunter who brought its trophies indoors, didn’t catch it. I miss that blackbird.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the weeks after the deaths of three women in quick succession in Ballarat last year, the principals of three of the regional Victorian city’s high schools brought their students together for a joint forum.</p> <p>“The community was feeling pretty broken,” Stephan Fields, principal of Ballarat high school says.</p> <p>“Ballarat – like many regional centres – is highly interconnected. There was so many connections across so many schools, sport establishments and friendship groups. So it had a really profound ripple effect.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Fields says what the forum heard from the students was sobering. Some young women said they avoided going for a run at night. Others spoke of fear becoming part of their daily life. Young men spoke about their desire to be more vulnerable and the constraints of traditional gender roles.</p> <p>“All of them said they wanted things to change,” Fields says.</p> <p>Their call was heard. On Thursday, the Victorian government will launch Respect Ballarat – an Australian-first trial of a “saturation model” to prevent gender-based violence.</p> <p>The model involves flooding a community with multiple programs, campaigns, education and support services to shift the attitudes and behaviours that drive violence.</p> <p>Helen Bolton, chief executive of Respect Victoria, says messaging in the city will be “impossible to ignore”.</p> <p>The four-year $9.8m trial was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/31/ballarat-domestic-violence-against-women-ads-saturation-victoria-premier-jacinta-allan-ntwnfb\">announced last year</a> in response to an outpouring of grief and anger after the disappearance and alleged murder of 51-year-old Samantha Murphy, the death of mother Rebecca Young in a suspected murder-suicide by her partner, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/18/hannah-mcguire-murder-lachlan-young-pleads-guilty-ntwnfb\">murder of Hannah McGuire</a> by her ex-boyfriend.</p> <p>Data <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/recorded-crime-victims/latest-release#key-statistics\">released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> earlier this month, showed there were 175 victims of family homicide and related offences recorded nationally in 2024 – an increase of 14 victims from 2023. Of these, 37 were located in Victoria.</p> <p>According to the Australian Femicide Watch, 50 Australian women have been killed so far this year.</p> <p>Fields has been involved in the co-design of the model for the past 12 months. This work is deeply personal, as he has a relative who experienced family violence.</p> <p>“These are real stories that are happening today and will be happening tomorrow, but we’ve got to believe in a future where we can address this, because for me, there is no other option,” he says.</p> <p>Men, children and young people, new parents – particularly fathers – and emerging community leaders have been identified as the priority groups. In the initial stages, efforts will focus on workplaces, community sports clubs, schools, and early childhood, pre-natal, and neonatal settings.</p> <p>The co-design process revealed that, although young people often receive the right messages in the classroom, they were undermined by the attitudes and behaviours they encounter elsewhere – including at home, in sports clubs and among their peers.</p> <p>Sport, in particular, stood out as “woven into the culture of Ballarat”, with high participation among children under 14 and adults in their 30s. But despite efforts to promote inclusion, “misogyny, homophobia and excusing of violence on and off the field” remains prevalent.</p> <p>About 11,000 couples in Ballarat are raising children, with many involved in the co-design reporting difficulties in building equal partnerships, while across the city’s 5,000 workplaces, leadership remains male-dominated.</p> <p>In schools, however, Ballarat is leading the way. Earlier this month, it was announced all 62 schools had signed on to deliver the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/16/victoria-schools-respectful-relationships-toxic-masculinity-andrew-tate-law-changes-ntwnfb\">respectful relationships education program</a> – making it the first regional area in the state to reach full participation.</p> <p>Fields says this was driven largely by the students themselves.</p> <p>“What they said was, ‘We need to know that if we’re at a party, that the same principles around “no means no” are being taught in every single school, regardless of whether or not it’s state, it’s independent or faith, we want a common message around respect, around safety’,” he says.</p> <p>Bolton says community members will be empowered to “lean in and call out inappropriate behaviour”, training will be rolled out across the priority areas and there will be several targeted advertising campaigns including social media, billboards, cinema and radio ads, beginning with one focused on positive masculinity.</p> <p>The pilot will also be supported by a boost in local specialist family violence services.</p> <p>If successful, it will be rolled out to other parts of the state, and possibly even the country – South Australia’s recent royal commission into family violence has already recommended two similar pilot programs based on the Ballarat approach.</p> <p>“This could be the ultimate model of how we do drive down violence in our community,” Bolton says.</p> <p>The minister for women, Natalie Hutchins, says the Ballarat community had “come together after significant tragedies to take action to build a place free from violence”.</p> <p>“When communities unite to reinforce these messages, the evidence shows a stronger and lasting impact.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>Anthony Albanese’s 10 days in the Pacific have been less than stellar.</p> <p>Last week, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/albanese-went-to-vanuatu-to-sign-a-500m-agreement-but-leaves-empty-handed-thanks-to-concerns-about-china\">could not land</a> a $500m economic and security agreement with Vanuatu, the second such rebuff from Vanuatu in as many years. The idea that Australia should exercise veto rights over Vanuatu’s relationship with third parties (which is code for China) did not strike its advocates as a bridge too far. Just a month ago, Australian ministers initialled the Nakamal agreement, apparently unaware of the opposition and resentment within both government and opposition ranks in Port Vila.</p> <p>This week, he could not land an even more ambitious defence treaty with Papua New Guinea that would have seen the virtual integration of the defence forces of PNG and Australia in mutual defence. Who the aggressor might be was not mentioned of course, though China loomed large in media reporting. Again, no one seems to have been aware of the opposition and resentment within the PNG parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/australia-png-defence-treaty-delayed-anthony-albanese-papua-new-guinea\">Anthony Albanese fails to seal defence treaty between Australia and PNG</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The foreign minister’s explanation for the collapse of the Vanuatu deal was the “<a href=\"https://www.foreignminister.gov.au/minister/penny-wong/transcript/interview-peter-stefanovic-sky-news-first-edition\">permanent contest</a>” with China for influence in the Pacific. Penny Wong said Australia had lost the opportunity to be the only partner of choice in the Pacific, now working instead to be the partner of choice in our own interests. Whether it is in Australia’s interests to be in a permanent competition with China in the Pacific is arguable.</p> <p>Notwithstanding his earlier announcement that the PNG defence treaty would be signed, the prime minister’s explanation for the collapse of the PNG deal was essentially that democracies are not the same as authoritarian regimes because they go through processes which Australia respects. Essentially, it was a matter of insufficient time for due process.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>That is an extraordinary admission. If diplomacy is not an enterprise demanding intelligence and tact and a respect for process, what on earth is it?</p> <p>This double whammy in the Pacific is a failure of diplomacy. But the failure of diplomacy is symptomatic of a much deeper set of systemic failures: a failure of mindset; a failure of policy; and, critically, a failure to appreciate the cultural, political and social dynamics of the Pacific.</p> <p>Australia’s default foreign policy mindset is a function of two factors: dependence on America and fear of China.</p> <p>We see everything through the lens of our relationship with America. As the defence minister <a href=\"https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/transcripts/2025-06-14/doorstop-interview-geelong\">continues to pronounce</a>, the US alliance is the “cornerstone” of both our defence and foreign policies. It is no accident that the prime minister was seeking to stitch up the two treaties in the Pacific before he meets Donald Trump, possibly on the margins of the UN General Assembly later this month.</p> <p>Our ingrained fear of China dominates the way we think about both Asia and the Pacific. Our dependence on the US is a function of our fear of China. These related concerns thread their way through almost every foreign policy issue, whether it is our inability to criticise America’s bombing of nuclear facilities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/23/as-the-us-chooses-destruction-over-diplomacy-in-iran-australia-has-to-decide-between-principle-and-prostration\">in Iran</a> or Israel’s bombing of the people and the civilian infrastructure of the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>The policy failure is quite simply gobsmacking.</p> <p>Policy is pretty easy to understand. It consists of and elaborates the principles on which decisions are taken. But policy is hard to do, because it deals with the complex interrelationships between values, interests, needs, expectations and resources. So good policy ensures that the right people make the right decisions at the right time, generating effective and equitable outcomes.</p> <p>It would appear that the politicians in Port Vila and Port Moresby made the right decisions, because they acted in their own interests by refusing to give Australia veto powers over the conduct of their foreign and security policy. They preserved their sovereignty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/png-australia-defence-treaty-delay-blow-for-anthony-albanese\">Latest blow to Labor’s Pacific defence strategy might not be the embarrassment the Coalition claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia’s politicians did not make the right decisions, because they sought to confine these two Pacific countries within Australia’s strategic imperatives without acknowledging that theirs might well be different.</p> <p>This reflects the most fundamental failure of all – Australia’s inability and unwillingness to understand the communities of the Pacific and the way they do business. We are often seen in the Pacific, including by our friends in New Zealand, as arrogant, condescending and patronising, quick to lecture and slow to listen.</p> <p>This fundamental failure is the consequences of decades of less-than-benign neglect, where we have shown tough love to peoples we like to talk down to as “our Pacific family”. We are deaf to the entreaties of Pacific countries that we address the causes of global warming (mitigation), not just its consequences (adaptation), just as we drive hard bargains in affording them access to the Australian economy.</p> <p>If the Albanese government is capable of learning anything from its week-and-a-bit in the Pacific, it should be this: human security is the issue that really matters in the Pacific. Australia needs to understand that the Pacific nations might not want to be Australia’s partners of choice in the battle of the giants.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/17/trump-golf-course-in-scotland-accused-of-breaching-sewage-limits",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Firm that runs Aberdeenshire resort says it is ‘categorically wrong’ to suggest it has caused environmental damage</p>",
    "content": "<p>Donald Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf course has breached sewage contamination limits 14 times since 2019, documents reveal.</p> <p>The 36-hole golf course, one of two that Trump owns in Scotland, also has a five-star hotel, a whisky bar and two restaurants. Trump International Golf Links, Scotland has a private sewage system that treats wastewater before releasing it into the ground by soaking it through gravel beds in raised filter mounds.</p> <p>According to documents released from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) to the investigative journalism outlet Unearthed, however, groundwater samples of discharges at the course breached contamination levels on a number of occasions, including four times in 2024 and once in the first half of this year.</p> <p>These samples exceeded limits for biomechanical oxygen demand – a measure of the amount of oxygen required by microbes to digest organic matter – suspended solid particles and ammoniacal nitrogen. These are all contaminants from human waste that has not been properly treated.</p> <p>The agency categorised eight of the 14 incidents as “upper tier”, which it describes as “extreme events which have the potential to cause immediate and serious environmental harm” and can trigger enforcement action.</p> <p>The US president is currently on a state visit in the UK. He is staying at Windsor Castle, and his trip includes a state banquet hosted by King Charles, a military flypast and other expressions of pomp and pageantry.</p> <p>Keir Starmer has made getting a grip on the sewage problem blighting the UK’s rivers and seas a key mission for his government.</p> <p>The executive vice-president of Trump International, Scotland, Sarah Malone, said that since the licence for the private wastewater system was issued in 2013, applications to renew it had never been refused.</p> <p>“When the position was reviewed in August last year, leading environmental engineers submitted a detailed report demonstrating that there was no environmental impact from the way wastewater was being treated and this report was accepted by Sepa,” she said.</p> <p>“It would be categorically wrong to suggest that our system was causing environmental damage and we would not hesitate to challenge such an assertion by any means necessary.</p> <p>“From the outset, Sepa has insisted on a particularly intense level of monitoring of wastewater management at the site. A vast number of samples have been analysed by both Sepa and specialist environmental engineers we commissioned. The licence has not been breached 14 times – that is incorrect given that a certain number of exceedances are permitted when the frequency of monitoring is taken into account.</p> <p>“Any exceedances have been very rare. We have been approved repeatedly by Sepa to continue the operation of our system more than a decade. The specialist environmental engineers we commissioned to undertake a parallel monitoring exercise contested Sepa’s findings on the occasional minor infractions. Those matters about methodology and sampling remain a matter of discussion between the engineers and Sepa.</p> <p>“Far from causing environmental damage, we are extremely proud of the environmental contribution at our golf courses. Extensive native grasses have been planted, many hectares of indigenous vegetation have been translocated, and new wetland and dune-slack habitats are flourishing.”</p> <p>A Sepa spokesperson said: “While we expect better performance, our risk-based assessment concluded the environmental impact in these instances was minimal.</p> <p>“The treated effluent passes through a soak-away system after the sampling point, providing further natural filtration before entering the ground. The soak-away significantly reduces the risk of the effluent impacting the environment.”</p> <p>Trump hosted Starmer at his Scottish golf courses in July. During a press conference, the president spoke at length of his “opulent and beautiful” resorts as the prime minister looked on in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/trump-uses-press-conference-with-starmer-to-boost-his-golfing-business\">apparent discomfort</a>. During the trip, Trump opened a new course at the Aberdeenshire site.</p> <p>Trump International Golf Links, Scotland built the course on the Menie estate, north of Aberdeen, in 2012. Campaigners say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/17/new-trump-golf-course-provokes-fury-in-scotland\">construction damaged the dune system</a> at the nearby Foveran Links, a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Scotland’s protected areas committee <a href=\"https://www.nature.scot/partial-denotification-foveran-links-sssi-confirmed\">decided in 2020</a> that parts of the dune system no longer merited the SSSI designation. </p> <p>Sepa initially objected to the plans to build the course, partly because the resort did not have a connection to the public sewage system.</p>",

It receives the vast majority of capital (85%), even though it produces less than a third of British research. The report flagged the government’s pension reforms, aimed at getting pension funds to invest in UK assets.</p> <p><strong>Toby Reid</strong>, executive director at Pioneer Group, explains: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British science is globally significant, with the UK boasting 17 universities in the world top 100, including four in the top 10.

Yet it only produced 31% of the research in the UK. This demonstrates the pressing need to ensure we maximise the commercial potential of research flowing from regions up and down the country. </p> <p>Indeed, the world is entering a new kind of race – not for territory or trade – but for next generation technologies. Our universities hold the keys to these technologies, but we must go further and faster in commercialising them to enable their real-world impact.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matt Mason</strong>, head of innovation at The Crown Estate, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British science is world-class, but its commercial potential remains largely untapped.</p> <p>To make the most of these opportunities and our innovation economy, we must build the necessary infrastructure to support talent, venture capital and technology.

Yet we aren’t in the camp that thinks rate cuts are over, given the prospect of further progress in services inflation and wage growth.</p> <p>Food inflation nudged above 5%, as both we and the BoE had anticipated. That’s a particular bugbear of officials right now, given the formative role food prices play in inflation expectations, but also because of the correlation with restaurant/café prices.</p> <p>Catering makes up 40% of the Bank’s preferred measure of “core services” inflation, which gauges the segment of the inflation basket most intrinsically linked to the underlying performance of the UK economy. Inflation in the hospitality sector has been stuck around 4% this year, which we think is linked to pressure from April’s payroll tax and National Living Wage hikes.</p> </blockquote> <p>While services inflation slowed to 4.7% from 5%, this was mainly because of volatile air fares. The core services basket stayed at 4.2%, Smith calculated.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, we think there is still scope for services inflation to undershoot the Bank’s forecasts further in the next release for September. And more broadly, we are seeing a significant easing in rental growth, which is set to be a significant source of service sector disinflation over the coming months.</p> <p>If we’re right about that, it would tip the balance slightly more in favour of a November rate cut, which we still narrowly expect. Certainly, we aren’t in the camp that thinks rate cuts are over. Services inflation should show more visible progress next spring, while wage growth should ease below 4% by year-end.

A real act of leadership is needed now,” he said. “Australia needs to be on that 1.5C pathway if we want to convince the rest of the world to follow.”</p> \n<p>Hare said Australia’s first national climate risk assessment, released on Monday, showed the country “has a lot of skin in the game” and the 1.5C goal was “critically important in protecting our way of life and our ecosystems”.</p> \n<p>The Climate Council’s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said the target decision was “a critical moment for Australia”. “It will shape the lives of all of us for the next century,” she said. “At stake is the safety, security and prosperity of our communities and the environment in a fast-heating world.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/labor-will-announce-its-2035-emissions-target-this-week-heres-how-it-could-shape-australias-next-decade\">Labor will announce its 2035 emissions target this week. Here’s how it could shape Australia’s next decade</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government has been advised on the 2035 target by the independent Climate Change Authority, which is required to consider climate science, international developments, economics, technology developments and social impact. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, received the authority’s final advice last week and is responsible for recommending a target to cabinet.</p> \n<p>An authority consultation paper on the target last year suggested a reduction of at least 65% and up to 75% would be ambitious, but achievable if more action was taken. It is expected to narrow this range and drop below 75% in its final advice.</p> \n<p>Business organisations, climate advocacy groups and analysts have lobbied and consulted with the government over where it should land, with arguments ranging from a call for a target below 60% to reaching net zero by 2035. Those urging a more ambitious goal have largely supported a campaign for 75% to be included in the range. Others have argued this would be too exacting to reach.</p> \n<p>The target range will form the basis of Australia’s “nationally determined contribution”, or NDC, submitted to the UN. Australia’s existing target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p> \n<p>More than 190 countries are expected to submit targets before the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil in November. Countries agreed each NDC would be more ambitious than the last and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. But some developed nations have submitted NDCs not aligned with the 1.5C goal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2474c0d9-53d8-4d3a-a49b-9fee77e10aaf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xozl5woAR20?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bowen has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/13/chris-bowens-defining-climate-moment-is-nigh-and-he-knows-what-it-means-if-we-get-it-wrong\">backed the need for science-based climate targets</a>, including calling at UN climate summits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/19/chris-bowen-on-cop27s-urgent-fight-if-were-not-trying-to-keep-to-15c-then-what-are-we-here-for\">for the “strongest possible action” to limit global heating to 1.5C</a>.</p> \n<p>The climate risk assessment found climate change was already affecting every aspect of life in Australia and warned continuing rising temperatures would escalate the risk of heatwave-related deaths, the rupturing of financial systems and supply chains, and billions of dollars in damage from extreme weather events and rising sea levels.</p> \n<p>Albanese described the report as a “wake-up call” and said it would inform the 2035 target while also stressing the need to plan for an “orderly” transition to avoid losing public support for climate action.</p> \n<p>The chief executive of WWF-Australia, Dermot O’Gorman, said the target would be “the most consequential climate policy decision this term of government, this decade, and this century”. He said it was an opportunity to “lock in trust with the Pacific”, to advance the country’s bid to host the Cop31 climate summit next year and “unlock Australia’s place as a renewables superpower”.</p> \n<p>“It’s the Australian prime minister’s sliding doors moment on climate,” he said. “Setting an un-ambitious target locks in another decade of pollution and climate damage. The possibility of stabilising warming to the safer temperature limit of 1.5C above preindustrial levels is on a knife-edge.”</p> \n<p>Gavan McFadzean, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate and energy program manager, said a weak target would lead to continued fossil fuel extraction and send a “defeatist message” to business leaving “the opportunities of the clean energy transformation to other countries”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;><script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

Kirk, the 31-year-old Turning Point USA founder and Trump ally, was gunned down while speaking at Utah Valley University on 10 September.</p> <p>The vanished study opened with: “Since 1990, far-right extremists have committed far more ideologically motivated homicides than far-left or radical Islamist extremists, including 227 events that took more than 520 lives. In this same period, far-left extremists committed 42 ideologically motivated attacks that took 78 lives.”</p> <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/charlie-kirk-shooter-charged\">has been charged</a> with Kirk’s murder and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. In the aftermath of the shooting, Donald Trump and other Republican leaders have blamed “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-charlie-kirk-radical-left-political-opposition-3875efd0674ed2a22a719dfb42ace6ab\">radical left</a>” elements for the attack.</p> <p>The National Institute of Justice study, which was based on research spanning three decades, represented one of the most comprehensive government assessments of domestic terrorism patterns. It found that “militant, nationalistic, white supremacist violent extremism has increased in the United States” and that “the number of far-right attacks continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism”.</p> <p>Where the report once appeared, the justice department wrote it was “reviewing its websites and materials in accordance with recent executive orders”, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/doj-deletes-study-showing-domestic-terrorists-are-most-often-right-wing/\">according to 404Media</a>, though the page is now unavailable.</p> <p>But the findings align with <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/escalating-terrorism-problem-united-states\">independent research</a> from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which analyzed 893 terrorist plots between 1994 and 2020. That study concluded: “Rightwing attacks and plots account for the majority of all terrorist incidents in the United States since 1994.”</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://globalextremism.org/post/beirich-statement-house-homeland-security/\">congressional testimony</a> in 2023, Heidi Beirich, the executive vice-president of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told lawmakers as an expert witness that “data on acts of political violence clearly shows that it is the far right that is driving terrorism in the US, including targeting and, in certain cases, murdering law enforcement”.</p> <p>“That is not to say there is no violence from far-left actors,” she continued, “it is just simply not on the scale or as deadly as what is coming from far-right actors.”</p> <p>Kirk had built Turning Point USA into a major conservative youth organization and spoke at last year’s Republican national convention. He was addressing students when he was shot.</p> <p>The justice department has not responded to requests for comment about the study’s removal.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Attorney general during Trump’s first term made comments to House oversight committee, transcript shows</p>",
    "content": "<p>The former US attorney general William Barr has repeated his finding that Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 death in prison was “undoubtedly suicide” to a panel of lawmakers looking into the disgraced financier’s crimes and connections.</p> <p>Barr, the top prosecutor in Donald Trump’s first term when the justice department brought sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, made the comments to the House oversight committee late Monday, according to <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Barr-Transcript.pdf\">an interview transcript</a>.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories have for years swirled that Epstein was murdered while in federal custody, an idea promoted by a family member and by Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. A series of security lapses at the Metropolitan correctional center in New York where Epstein was held have served to bolster the claims, for which there is no hard evidence.</p> <p>In an August deposition with the committee, Barr maintained his belief that Epstein had killed himself, and said he had been aware that Epstein was on suicide watch before his death.</p> <p>Barr said that as the investigation into Epstein’s death progressed, “it became clearer and clearer to me that it was undoubtedly suicide” and that he did not believe it was possible for someone to get into Epstein’s cell without being captured on security cameras.</p> <p>“For me, the video was the icing on the cake,” Barr said. “There was a lot of evidence about, you know, his state of mind and other physical evidence pointing to suicide and also testimonial and records pointing to this.</p> <p>“It was my judgment, from what I saw on the camera and what I looked at, I didn’t think it was possible for someone to get up to the tier and open the door without being picked up in the camera,” he said.</p> <p>But Barr acknowledged that the camera did have “a bit of a blind spot” and said he understood that might make people “suspicious”.</p> <p>Barr also described how he had informed Trump of Epstein’s death.</p> <p>“I called [the president] up and said, ‘You better brace for this,’ and I told him words to that effect, and I told him about it and told him we were going to be investigating it very vigorously,” Barr said.</p> <p>“He had the same reaction I did, which was, ‘How the hell did that happen, he’s in federal custody?’”</p> <p>In a second conversation with the president on the subject, Trump “said something to the effect that he had broken off with Epstein long ago and that he had actually pushed him out of Mar-a-Lago”, Barr recalled.</p> <p>Trump and Epstein had a well-publicized falling-out over a real estate deal, after having been friends for about 15 years.</p> <p>Barr’s testimony came as the committee released letters from the former US attorneys general Alberto Gonzalez and Jeff Sessions indicating they had no relevant information or knowledge of the subject.</p> <p>The committee chairman, James Comer, has also asked the Epstein estate for unredacted cash ledgers, message logs, calendars and flight logs. The estate has already turned over some documents but many lack detailed information.</p> <p>The former US attorney Alex Acosta, who oversaw a contentious plea deal with Epstein in 2008 that allowed him to plead guilty to Florida solicitation charges, is scheduled to appear before the panel on Friday. Under the deal, Epstein served only 13 months and <a href=\"https://www.wptv.com/news/local-news/investigations/convicted-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-spent-hours-at-home-during-work-release-was-responsible-for-his-own-transportation-from-pbso-jail\">was allowed to leave jail</a> six days a week under a work release program.</p>",

He was asked about Hamas as well but refused to answer questions, citing client confidentiality. The following day, the contents of his phone were copied by the police.</p> <p>“In the decade that I have been involved in national security cases, I have never heard of lawyers in England being targeted to this extent because of their clients,” said Ansari. “I have dealt with the usual media harassment for taking on clients who some consider to be controversial, including Hamas who my law firm represented in its application to be removed from the government’s list of banned groups.</p> <p>“Some have complained that representing Hamas brings the profession into disrepute. Yet, what really undermines the integrity of the profession is when unpopular clients are unable to secure legal representation because of fear of public opprobrium and state intimidation.”</p> <p>Ansari holds a consultant role at Duncan Lewis solicitors, having previously been director and principal solicitor at Riverway Law solicitors, which acted for Hamas pro bono so as not to breach sanctions. After the Hamas application was submitted, the shadow home secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the Campaign Against Antisemitism reported Ansari to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).</p> <p>He said that in attempting to get his views on the proscription of Palestine Action, an interviewing officer said to him: “Many people, including my wife, think the ban is ludicrous.” Ansari said he was also asked about which A-levels he took and where he socialised.</p> <p>As part of the claim, Ansari is seeking an urgent interim injunction prohibiting police from “examining, sifting, or sharing the copy of his work mobile telephone pending the resolution of this claim”. It says the phone’s contents are “overwhelmingly covered by legal privilege”.</p> <p>Ansari said he was held by police for three hours during which he was fingerprinted, photographed and swabbed for DNA and told to remove his face ID and pin from his phone or face arrest.</p> <p>Should the claim succeed, he has said he will seek damages for trespass to property, trespass to person and false imprisonment.</p> <p>The Home Office and police did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian understands that the police have said that they will not destroy the copy of the phone until it has been reviewed by independent counsel.</p>",

    "content": "<p>US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration\">Immigration</a> and Customs Enforcement (Ice) warned on Tuesday that assaulting its officers constitutes a federal crime punishable by felony charges.</p> \n<p>“Anyone – regardless of immigration status – who assaults an ICE officer WILL face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law,” the agency <a href=\"https://x.com/ICEgov/status/1967906419719516574\">posted</a> on X. Embedded in the post was an image that read “think before you resist” with a clenched fist.</p> \n<p>The post represents a direct public threat of prosecution, and the broad language could allow prosecutors to pursue federal assault charges for actions that would traditionally be classified as resisting arrest or even protest activities.</p> \n<p>But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded its definition of threats to include filming Ice operations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kristi-noem\">Kristi Noem</a>, the homeland security secretary, defined “violence” <a href=\"https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/secretary-kristi-noem-addresses-surge-in-attacks-on-ice-agents-in-tampa-dhs-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-agents-florida-department-of-homeland-security-july-13-2025\">in July</a> as “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety.

    "title": "Why random lines of video game dialogue get stuck in our heads",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/17/video-game-dialogue-pushing-buttons",
    "description": "<p>From famous Street Fighter lines to quips from 90s classics, these are the quotes we hear again and again – and even incorporate into our own lives</p>",
    "content": "<p>Some snippets of video game dialogue, like classic movie quotes, are immediately recognisable to a swathe of fans. From Street Fighter’s “hadouken!” to Call of Duty’s “remember, no Russian” to BioShock’s “would you kindly?”, there are phrases so creepy, clever or cool they have slipped imperceptibly into the gaming lexicon, ensuring that whenever they’re memed on social media, almost everyone gets the reference.</p> <p>But there are also odd little phrases, sometimes from obscure games, that stick with us for seemingly no reason. I recall most of the vocal barks from the second world war strategy game Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, even though I haven’t played it for 20 years. Why is it that I’ll lose my headphones, wallet and phone on a daily basis, but I have absolute recall when it comes to the utterances of burly soldier Samuel Brooklyn? Why am I doomed to “Finally, some action”, “Consider it done, boss” and the immortal “okey dokey” echoing through my head? What is wrong with me?</p> <p>Fortunately, when I <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/keefstuart.bsky.social/post/3lyfcpunakk2j\">posted about this on Bluesky</a>, I discovered I was not alone. Hundreds of gamers got back to me about the random game dialogue lodged in their own heads. Some were lesser-known quotes from famous titles: comic book writer Kieron Gillen is haunted by the line “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rm5K3xJHNNI?si=micr71vFV-BwQ3SL\">I’ve not seen such bravery</a>” from Gauntlet, while video game academic Kat Brewster wrote that she thinks about the game’s “ah, sustenance!” line all the time. Matthew Castle, of the gaming podcast <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/the-back-page-a-video-games-podcast\">The Back Page</a>, simply cannot forget the way Beedle <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aTTmyCxZoVU?si=9vgNHr4b4X7Vd_R3\">says thank you</a> in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Game designer and artist Anna Hollinrake cannot escape the voice of the random Pokémon trainer who said: “Whether hot to trot or cool cat not, chill at my papa’s shop.” “It runs around in my head again and again,” she said. “Drives me mad.”</p> <p>Some games came up again and again. Worms, Grand Theft Auto, House of the Dead and Monkey Island seem to be filled with memorable lines, sometimes because they’re funny, but often because they’re simply ludicrous. One fan of Bungie’s shooter Marathon has been unable to forget the phrase “Frog blast the vent core!”, only later discovering <a href=\"https://marathon.bungie.org/story/Frog_Blast_the_Vent_Core.html\">its strange origin</a>. Many players had adopted these lines of dialogue into their every day lives – several respondents admitted to thinking “<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/kzuhsg/wizard_needs_food_badly/\">wizard needs food badly</a>” whenever they open the fridge door.</p>    <p>So why have so many obscure lines remained in our brains all these years? Partly it’s about sheer repetition: in a 20-hour action-adventure game filled with non-player characters, you’re going to hear the same “barks” (quick pieces of NPC dialogue that express surprise or provide contextual information) over and over again. This is why so many people recall everything the merchant says in Resident Evil 4 – by the end of the game, you’ve heard “What’re ya buyin’?” several hundred times. There is also an element of echolalia, the repetition of certain comforting words and sounds as an act of self-soothing. Games are built around rhythm and repetition, so it is perhaps natural for us to adopt elements of these patterns into our lives.</p> <p>Game dialogue can also become an in-joke with friends, enforcing bonds and shared interests and memories in the same way as quoting pieces of movie dialogue. Bluesky user Steve O’Gorman wrote this about F-Zero GX: “Samurai Goroh’s line delivery of ‘You stole the prize money from us last time’ while flailing his arms has randomly stuck with my friendship group for 20+ years.” With video games, our own subjective experiences in the worlds can often be as memorable and valuable as the intended narratives. Sometimes, the idea that we could be the only player to have encountered an obscure character, or heard a specific snatch of dialogue, creates a connection with the game that becomes personal.</p> <p>I don’t think I have a deep connection with tough Samuel Brooklyn, despite the number of times I sent him to his death while he yelled the immortal words: “No problem, man.” But clearly, I was going through something when I was playing that game, or I was just amused by the disparity between the seriousness of the fight against the Nazis and the daft, repetitive phrases that accompanied my every mouse click. We never really know what makes a moment of our life memorable, or why a line from an old episode of Gilmore Girls, Twin Peaks or Scarface sticks around in our subconscious. But it’s nice to know we’re not alone with our weird little aural collections.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>Unfairly maligned on its original release and now available in a lush Nintendo Switch 2 conversion, <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong> is one of my favourite ever Star Wars games. Choosing to eschew all the mysticism and vainglorious posturing of Jedi lore in favour of a scoundrel-turned-resistance hero story, it’s an exciting romp across familiar planets, against familiar Imperial bad guys.</p> <p>The design of the worlds and the various bases and spacecraft you explore is incredible, capturing the slightly battered futurism of those early Ralph McQuarrie concept sketches, and the dialogue is often genuinely funny. Lead character Kay Vess is a nobody in the Star Wars canon, but that’s the whole point, and the relationships she forges on her quest to pull off the ultimate heist against the Empire reflect the themes and ideals of the original movie. For such a big story, the Switch 2 screen makes a wonderful venue, allowing you to carry a whole galaxy with you wherever you go.</p> <p><strong>Available on: </strong>PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox<strong><br>Estimated playtime: </strong>25+ hours</p> <h2>What to read</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Eurogamer has <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day\">kicked off a series of features</a> about contentious topics in video game design, and the first looks at the subject of <strong>boss runbacks</strong> – ie the length of space and gameplay between a checkpoint and a boss battle. Silksong has been challenging (frustrating?) gamers with its lengthy, often difficult runbacks, which can seem like a sadistic insult after you’ve failed a boss fight for the 56th time. But are they, in fact, a legitimate part of the rhythm of games? In my opinion, they are the <em>worst</em>, but don’t get me started.</p></li> <li><p>I didn’t think I’d ever link to the United Nations on this newsletter, but the organisation has <a href=\"https://unric.org/en/video-games-and-democracy-exploring-new-frontiers-for-civic-participation/\">just featured a piece</a> about video games and <strong>democracy</strong> on its website to mark the International Day of Democracy (15 September). The piece looks at the history of persuasive games and advergames made by charities to highlight campaigns and asks if games have a role in informing players about democratic rights and participation.</p></li> <li><p>The wonderful retro gaming zine <strong>Forgotten Worlds</strong> is back with <a href=\"https://www.forgottenworlds.net/video-game-zine-shop\">a new issue</a>, this time dedicated to Sega, or more specifically the company’s “blue skies” period of the late 80s and early 90s when its arcade and home console games invariably took place in super-bright, sunshine-lit worlds. There are lots of excerpts from contemporary games mags as well as interviews with key Sega staff and journalists including Gary Cutlack, founder of influential Sega fansite UK Resistance.

Several titles touch on the themes we’re used to – ie are games addictive or bad for us? Among these, I recommend <strong>Lost in a Good Game</strong> by Pete Etchells and <strong>Extra Lives</strong> by Tom Bissell. More overtly sociopolitical examples are Angela Nagle’s vitally important <strong>Kill All Normies</strong>, Shira Chess’s <strong>Play Like a Feminist</strong> and Marijam Did’s <strong>Everything to Play For</strong>.</p> <p>I also recommend <strong>Games of Empire</strong> by Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter, and <strong>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</strong> by Jason Schreier, which look at the sometimes shadowy economics of the industry. Finally, look out for <strong>Power Play</strong> by games industry journalist (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/jan/17/pushing-buttons-uk-video-game-industry\">and Pushing Buttons contributor!</a>) George Osborn, on how corporations and governments use the popularity of games for political purposes.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/17/sleep-remedies-aids-tested",
    "description": "<p>Can a pillow spray or magnesium bath really improve your sleep? Our exhausted reviewer put 13 popular insomnia remedies to the test</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/06/best-mattress\"><strong>The best mattresses, tested</strong></a></p>",
    "content": "<p>When I told my GP it often takes me three hours or more to fall asleep, she pulled the kind of face you never want to see on a doctor. She scribbled in her notes, and then said the dreaded phrase: “Have you tried sleep hygiene?”</p> <p>Like most insomniacs, I’ve sleep-hygiened the heck out of my life. I go to bed at the same time every day in a TV-free bedroom with my phone far from reach and, when necessary, my husband in the spare room. Then I lie there, worrying about my failure to be sleep-hygienic enough.</p> <p>Tired of being tired, I craved real help – ideally not in pill form. In the past, sleeping pills have only worked for me in the short term, and weaker sedatives such as first-generation antihistamines make me sleepy but without sending me to sleep. Social media is brimming with supposed miracle cures, including <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCO_vx5u7Li/\">blueberries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEuK6smMndd/\">decaf coffee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG2ax5Oseef/\">tart cherry juice</a> – but do any of them work?</p> <p>I’m willing to try anything that spares me yet another lecture on sleep hygiene, so I put these and other claimed insomnia cures through their paces for the Filter. Here are the ones that sent me into a deep slumber, and those that just sent me round the bend.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’ve spent three decades reviewing consumer products, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/18/best-heated-clothes-airers-dryer-save-time-money-laundry\">heated clothes airers</a> to computer software, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims that we can magically improve our lives by buying their stuff.</p> <p>My recent roundups of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/06/best-mattress\">mattresses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/29/how-to-stop-hay-fever\">hay fever remedies</a> included a few items that genuinely helped me sleep better (and snore less – did I just say that out loud?). However, as a fiftysomething woman with a solid background in under-sleeping and overthinking, I need more than a nice bed to achieve optimal slumber. This is the product test I’ve been waiting for.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2> <p>After a quick nap, I started by scouring the internet for the drug-free sleep aids everyone’s talking about. Tart cherry juice gets the most attention, but since even the thought of it makes my bladder heavy, I also sought less liquid options, as well as friends’ recommendations.</p> <p>I bought some of the sleep aids on the list for testing and, in a few cases, requested samples from manufacturers. Where these items weren’t eaten, drunk or dissolved in an attempt to get me to sleep, I passed them on to two local charities: <a href=\"https://www.scratchcharity.co.uk/\">Scratch</a>, which collects homewares for people experiencing hardship, and <a href=\"https://www.farplace.org.uk/\">Farplace</a>, which raises money for animal rescue. I initially tested all the products in June, and then re-tested my favourites during the hottest weeks of August, when I needed all the sleep help I could get.</p> <p>During the initial testing phase, the temperature in my bedroom at night was about 16C, perfect for sleep. I was sleeping on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/03/millbrook-wool-luxury-4000-mattress-review\">Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 mattress</a>, among the most comfortable I’ve ever tested. For the August testing period, I slept on a <a href=\"https://www.bensonsforbeds.co.uk/products/sealy-newton-posturepedic-mattress/STK801501/\">firm Sealy Posturepedic mattress</a>, another winner in the comfort stakes, but night temperatures occasionally climbed to a sleep-destroying 22C.</p> <p>There were other background variables, too. Sleep blows hot and cold with me: some weeks I sleep well overnight and feel mentally energised by day, while other weeks I struggle to rest, work and play. To ensure I compared the products fairly, rather than just liking the ones that happened to coincide with a good sleep week, I tested them all more than once in different weeks.</p> <p>I also had to bear in mind that not all products work in the same way. Some aim to help you fall asleep, while others ensure you stay sleeping until it’s time to wake. I ranked each one on as many criteria as possible, including how quickly I nodded off, how energised I felt the next day, and whether it felt like money well spent.</p> <p>Here’s a chart rundown of the products that helped me get to sleep and stay there. I’ll start by revealing the most successful sleep aids, tailing off to the products that didn’t cure my insomnia but did make it slightly less boring.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>The sleep aids that worked for me</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Blackout sleep mask</strong></h2> <p>Sunshine is a beautiful thing, except when you’re trying to sleep at 4am. One of the worst nights I’ve ever had was in a B&amp;B where the vertical blinds might as well have been made of tissue paper. Street lights kept me awake until 5am, when sunrise took over.</p> <p>If only I’d had a decent sleep mask. The best masks genuinely block out all traces of light without pulling flat or tight across your eyes. I found my perfect match in the MyHalos mask, whose memory foam insert framed my eyes and gave my lashes plenty of space to move while I settled into REM sleep.</p> <p>On my first attempt I didn’t fall asleep much faster than usual, but I woke up in joyous disbelief at the nine (yes, nine!) hours of shut-eye I’d achieved. Once I’d grown used to wearing the mask in bed, it seemed to hasten my ability to nod off, perhaps because my brain had learned to associate it with good sleep.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 9 hours</p>    <p><strong>MyHalos blackout memory foam sleep mask</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.haloshealth.com/products/blackout-sleep-mask\" > £12.99 at MyHalos </a>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09CZ68WV3\" > £8.49 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Bluetooth sleep band</strong></h2> <p>Boring speech radio is my favourite grownup equivalent to bedtime stories. “Boring” is key; it can’t be anything that engages my mind. The main question is how to get those soporific sounds into my ears without disturbing my husband, Alan, or breaking sleep hygiene bans on bedside phones.</p> <p>Bluetooth sleep bands aim to do the trick by working a whole room away from your phone, and incorporating unobtrusive flat speakers into a headband that doubles as an eye mask. I tried a couple of models, including the new SnoozeBand Silk. Its cooling fabric proved super comfortable – although my hair did get caught in the Velcro – and its controls paired efficiently with my phone via Bluetooth. Twenty-odd minutes of BBC World Service cricket was enough to send me off, but I did wake up briefly an hour later to push the band off my face.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 7 hours</p>    <p><strong>Snooze</strong><strong>Band </strong><strong>Silk</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.snoozeband.co.uk/products/snoozeband-silk-sleep-mask-headphones\" > £99 at SnoozeBand </a>      <p><strong>Musicozy sleep headphones</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/MUSICOZY-Headphones-Headband-Bluetooth-Earphones-Blackness/dp/B0CLGTSMCF/\" > £17.59 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Mouldable silicone earplugs</strong></h2> <p>Unpredictable sounds such as TV, street rabble and 2am helicopters are sleep-killers (I never had kids, which is probably just as well). Sponge earplugs are useless for blocking these noises, but BioEars – recommended by a friend – genuinely work, reducing external sounds by about 22dB.</p> <p>These mouldable silicone blobs are safe and comfortable to wear in bed because they don’t go inside your ear canal, but rather block the entrance to it. While they didn’t help me fall asleep, I did, in fact, slumber in blissful silence through early morning noises, including No 27’s toddler, No 29’s early morning vacuuming, and my cat requesting breakfast (sorry, Iggy).</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 35 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 8 hours</p>    <p><strong>BioEars soft silicone earplugs</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.boots.com/bioears-soft-silicone-earplugs-with-activ-aloe-3-pairs-10064078\" > £5.55 from Boots </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Lavender pillow spray</strong></h2> <p>Smell is an incredibly powerful stimulatory sense, and numerous studies have confirmed the sleep-inducing power of lavender’s scent – including research that focuses on postmenopausal women, like me. A few spritzes of lavender oil-infused spray didn’t knock me out, but the aroma helped calm my racing mind and turned my pillow into a place of peace rather than insomniac dread. The pleasant smell also encouraged me to breathe deeply, which helped me fall asleep in an unusually quick 20 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 20 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 6 hours</p>    <p><strong>This Works deep sleep pillow spray, 75ml</strong> </p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray/p1795156?size=75ml\" > £21 at John Lewis </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/deep-sleep-pillow-spray-75ml/p/hbp60137988\" > £25 at M&amp;S </a>    <p><strong>Feather &amp; Down sweet dream pillow spray, 100ml</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.boots.com/feather-and-down-pillow-spray-10228385\" > £8 at Boots </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Magnesium bath flakes</strong></h2> <p>Magnesium, a <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3703169/\">proven sleep-enhancer</a>, is widely available in supplement form, and you don’t need a prescription. Go easy, though – taking more than 400mg can cause diarrhoea, as readers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/spare-by-prince-harry-review-dry-your-eyes-mate\">Prince Harry’s squits-and-all memoir</a> may recall. You could opt for magnesium-rich foods instead, such as spinach and dark chocolate, but you’d have to eat an awful lot of them. So manufacturers have found other ways to up your magnesium, such as bath flakes that allow your body to absorb the mineral as you soak.</p> <p>I added the recommended 250g of salts to a hot bath before bed, and the effect was significant. My body felt heavy and relaxed, and I felt none of the “restless leg” sensations that see me thrashing around after I’ve failed to nod off. However, 250g is a lot of bath flakes (£4.95 at the link below), and there are no bubbles or fragrance to make your bath more enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 30 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 7 hours</p>    <p><strong>BetterYou magnesium original bath flakes, 250g</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://betteryou.com/products/magnesium-flakes?variant=43844868472992\" > £4.95 at Better You </a>  <p><strong>Nutrition Geeks magnesium glycinate supplement</strong><strong>, 90 x 1,800mg capsules</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C9VVCL12\" > £9.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Tart cherry juice</strong></h2> <p>The juice of sour Montmorency cherries is having a moment among <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGLS7WRujOr/\">sleep influencers</a>, who claim it’s “a powerhouse of antioxidants, anthocyanin, naturally occurring melatonin, and tryptophan”.</p> <p>It’s also lip-smackingly delicious. If you’re a fan of fruity craft beer, get on this stuff – it’s like a cherry sour, minus the alcohol. It can also genuinely aid sleep, according to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3133468/\">scientific studies</a> and my own experience. I drank a recommended 250ml serving, just under half a pint, an hour before bed for a few nights, and fell asleep faster than average – although I woke briefly at 2am for the inevitable wee.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 30 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep: </strong>7 hours with a loo break</p>    <p><strong>Biona organic tart cherry juice, 1l</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/biona-organic-tart-cherry-juice/448926011\" > £8.25 at Ocado </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DDEHQWY\" > £6.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Dark chocolate</strong></h2> <p>This sounds insane. Chocolate is full of caffeine and sugar, two of nature’s greatest stimulants. But it also contains magnesium and tryptophan, which trigger your body to produce the “sleep hormone” melatonin. According to numerous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJW2itcIRgd/\">online chocolate fans</a>, these soporific chemicals far outweigh the stimulants if the chocolate contains at least 70% cocoa.</p> <p>I couldn’t imagine a couple of squares of chocolate having the same effect as magnesium or melatonin supplements, which I’ve found moderately useful for sleep. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/15/parents-black-market-melatonin-gummies-children-sleep\">Melatonin isn’t licensed for sale in the UK</a>, but it’s on supermarket shelves in mainland Europe.) But I actually slept very well after my four squares (about 30g) of 85% cocoa chocolate at bedtime, finding it soothing and – surprise, surprise – pleasurable. Not sure I, or my teeth, would want to eat it every night, though.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep: </strong>35 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 7 hours</p>    <p><strong>Green &amp; Black’s organic 85% dark chocolate, 90g</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/sharing-chocolate-bars/green-blacks-organic-85-dark-chocolate-bar-90-g/1000107814076\" > £2.74 at Asda </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.cadburygiftsdirect.co.uk/green-black-s-organic-dark-85-90g-chocolate-bar.html\" > £2.75 at Cadbury </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>White noise soundscapes</strong></h2> <p>Why do I often find it harder to fall asleep in bed than when I’m curled in the back seat of our little car? According to <a href=\"https://www.mother.ly/life/why-do-car-rides-put-babies-to-sleep/\">research with babies</a>, the rhythmic hum of a car engine is precisely the kind of white noise that enhances sleep.</p> <p>I’m too old to be driven round the block every time I need help dropping off, so I turned instead to the white noise-style soundscapes of the Calm app, whose 180m claimed downloads suggest it’s getting something right. When I streamed its driving-related sleep soundscapes to a Bluetooth speaker from my bedroom-banished phone, it was more like sleeping next to a busy road than in the womb-like ambience of the car. Its nature-themed mixes proved more soothing. The tweety rustling of “Deciduous Forest” rendered me unconscious long before the 30-minute sleep timer switched it off.</p> <p>If no app works for you, perhaps £349 will be money well spent on the “neuroscience-backed” SleepHub device. I found its soundscapes wonderfully relaxing, but I’d want it to bring me breakfast in bed, too, at this price.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> up to 45 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 7 hours</p>    <p><strong>Calm app for Android and iPhone</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.calm.com/app/movement/downloads\" > From £13.49 a month (after seven-day free trial) at Calm </a>      <p><strong>SleepHub</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sleephub.com/products/better-sleep-aid-insomnia\" > £349 at SleepHub </a>      <p><strong>Zello white noise machine</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.mamasandpapas.com/products/zello-original-white-noise-machine-652902700\" > £29.99 at Mamas &amp; Papas </a>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.kiddies-kingdom.com/toys-accessories/57887-zello-sleep-original-noise-machine-white.html\" > £29.99 at KiddiesKingdom </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Low-decibel electric fan</strong></h2> <p>Too hot or too cold in bed, and I’m like Goldilocks spitting out her porridge. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/27/best-electric-blankets-heated-throws\">electric blanket</a> helps send me to sleep in winter, but sleepless nights in summer are harder to fix – not least because many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jun/17/best-fans-uk\">electric fans</a> are noisy and aggressive with their airflow. With yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/26/summer-2025-almost-certainly-uk-warmest-record-met-office\">summer of record-breaking heat</a> behind us, it’s no surprise to see companies making their fans more bedroom-friendly by cutting their noise levels and adding functions such as sleep timers.</p> <p>I tried Meaco’s Sefte fan, whose 25dB sound level and 26W max power consumption are both significantly less than those of my fridge. Its gentle breeze and auto-off timer helped me nod off in comfort in the warmer nights of June, and then again when temperatures refused to back down in August.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 6-7 hours</p>    <p><strong>MeacoFan Sefte 10</strong><strong>in air circulator</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.meaco.com/products/sefte-10-pedestal-air-circulator\" > £179.99 at Meaco </a>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/MeacoFan-Sefte%C2%AE-Pedestal-Fan-Ultra-Quiet/dp/B0D1C6RP1P/\" > £179.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Body pillow</strong></h2> <p>As a side sleeper who never grew out of her knock knees, I struggle to get my legs comfy in bed. I’ve tried <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/10/14-everyday-items-that-could-improve-your-life\">knee pillows</a> before, but fidget too much to get the benefit – especially on hot summer nights. Simba’s new Stratos-tech body pillow promised a more huggable solution, keeping me cool from top to toe while enabling my spine to align comfortably.</p> <p>At first, I loved it. I snuggled it, inhaled it (my <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/this-works-deep-sleep-pillow-spray/p1795156?size=75ml\">lavender pillow spray</a> helped there), and certainly didn’t want to share it. But after a few tosses and turns, I found it was just getting in the way, so I kicked it over to Alan’s side of the bed. He promptly fell asleep wrapped around it.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 50 minutes, but husband fell asleep immediately<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 6 hours</p>    <p><strong>Simba body pillow</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://simbasleep.com/products/body-pillow\" > £109 at Simba </a>  <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Decaffeinated coffee</strong></h2> <p>Hot drinks have been used as bedtime pacifiers for centuries, but coffee? Experts, including the <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/nutrition/ask-the-expert/decaf-tea-coffee-bad-for-you\">British Heart Foundation</a>, recommend “switching to decaf coffee (for) a better night’s rest”, but fall short of saying it actually helps sleep.</p> <p>It was worth a try, but I can’t say my milk- and sugar-free mug of decaf had much impact on my snoozing. It still took me well over an hour to drop off, and I woke for about an hour during the night. I’ve had similar nights of sleep after drinking fully caffeinated coffee.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 90 minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 5-6 hours</p>    <p><strong>TrueStart Barista Grade decaf instant coffee, 100g</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/9210344\" > £3.48 at Asda </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/TrueStart-Barista-Grade-Instant-Coffee/dp/B0BHZSGYXP/\" > £3.48 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Lavazza decaffeinated coffee beans, 500g</strong></p>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/coffee-beans/lavazza-decaffeinated-coffee-beans/1000231566001\" > £9.98 at Asda </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.lavazza.co.uk/en/coffee-beans/decaf\" > £12.50 at Lavazza </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Pistachios</strong></h2> <p>While dark chocolate can help your body produce melatonin, nuts actually contain it. Pistachios are said to be one of the food world’s leading sources of melatonin, with <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pistachios-melatonin\">some studies</a> saying that 100g of pistachios contains up to 23mg of melatonin. That’s about seven times the amount in a typical melatonin pill, which you can’t buy legally in the UK anyway.</p> <p>I’d expected my bedtime fistful of tasty pistachios to knock me out faster than laughing gas, but it didn’t – at all. Instead, these delectably moreish nuts made me want to stay up and carry on eating. I had a lovely time but needed some sleep, so I was reaching for the lavender spray by midnight.</p> <p><strong>Time to fall asleep:</strong> 90+ minutes<br><strong>Time spent asleep:</strong> 5 hours</p>    <p><strong>Pistachios in shell, 200g</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/raw-nuts-seeds/asda-pistachios-in-shell-200-g/1000375030209\" > £2.23 at Asda </a>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/266375344\" > £2.60 at Tesco </a>    <p><strong>Shelled walnuts, 200g</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/raw-nuts-seeds/asda-walnuts-200-g/1000375030278\" > £2.23 at Asda </a>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/296546961\" > £2.60 at Tesco </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Blueberries</strong></h2> <p>Blueberries are particularly rich in polyphenols, especially antioxidants called anthocyanins, which have been shown to improve sleep quality.

    "description": "<p>RSC touring troupe stage King Lear in a school hall on St Mary’s before continuing to the Isle of Wight</p>",
    "content": "<p>“Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow!” <strong>King Lear, Act III, Scene 2</strong></p> <p>A fierce wind and strong swell had turned the Atlantic into a rollercoaster and when the troupe made landfall on the Isles of Scilly, several members felt rather wobbly and looked a little green around the gills.</p> <p>The life of a touring actor is not always glitz and glamour, but the first visit of <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/\">the Royal Shakespeare Company</a> (RSC) to Scilly – to perform King Lear – got off to a particularly rocky start.</p>    <p>“It was a rough crossing,” said <a href=\"https://oliversenton.com/\">Oliver Senton</a>, who plays Lear, as the 15-strong cast and crew recovered on <a href=\"https://stmarys-harbour.co.uk/\">the harbourside</a> of <a href=\"https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/st-marys/\">St Mary’s, the largest of the islands</a>, 30 miles off the south-west coast of mainland Britain. “We’re more used to being in a van or train when we’re going place to place. But it’s wonderful to be here, breaking territory, bringing theatre to new places.”</p> <p>Might he tap into this stormy weather <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/king-lear/about-the-play/famous-quotes\">for the famous scene in which Lear rages against the storm?</a> “Well, I’d say the storm for Lear is inside him – the weather is a reflection of his feelings,” Senton said. “But when you do a great play like this, you start to see echoes of it everywhere – in things you’re watching and reading and what people say to you, even in the rain and wind.”</p> <p>The show is <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/first-encounters-king-lear/\">a pared-down version of King Lear</a> – about a third of the full-length – mainly aimed at young people and their families. Backed by a grant from <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\">Arts Council England,</a> the idea is to take the play to audiences who may not usually have access to world-class Shakespearean actors.</p>    <p>Before the tour, the director, <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/blogs/whispers-from-the-wings/adapting-king-lear-for-young-audiences-with-director-justine-themen\">Justine Themen</a>, travelled around England, asking young people from Blackpool to Norwich what was on their minds. “They said they were concerned political leaders weren’t listening, especially around the climate crisis, and they were concerned with relationships with leaders in their own lives – parents and teachers,” said Themen. “All issues of justice, really.”</p> <p>Lear seemed the best play to dig into such themes. Themen said there were “Lear-like” leaders in the world acting in an autocratic way and not engaging with the needs and wants of their modern kingdoms.</p>    <p>Lear’s storm seemed a good way to think about the climate crisis, and the youngsters were drawn to the idea of the king asking his daughters to spell out how much they loved him. “They were fascinated by that,” Themen said.</p> <p>The storm meant the visit to Scilly was delayed by a day and once they were there the logistical challenges were many, including getting the troupe to and from their various B&amp;Bs scattered throughout the island.</p> <p>There was an anxious wait as their props were unloaded from the ferry and transported to the Five Islands Academy, where the RSC players were putting on four shows in the school hall. But everything fell into place and the first show, watched mostly by adult islanders (though some children also attended), was warmly received.</p>    <p>In this reimagining, the tragic ending is softened when the king’s Fool tells the audience to challenge leaders if they do not approve of what they are doing. Asked to shout out what they could do to make things better, Hattie, 11, called: “Work as a team.” Later she said she had liked the play, though found the blinding of Gloucester scary.</p> <p>Jeremy Brown, the creative director for <a href=\"https://www.iosmuseumandculturalcentre.org/culture-on-scilly\">Culture on Scilly,</a> was emotional at the final curtain. “To bring this quality of work to this little corner of the world is unreal and, I think, life changing for all of us,” he said.</p> <p>Rachel Lewin, the headteacher of Five Islands Academy, agreed. “It was so powerful,” she said. “There’s nothing like live Shakespeare. You can study it, as we do, and watch the films, but there’s nothing like being in the room with the raw emotion.”</p> <p>The production is also being taken to schools and community venues on the Isle of Wight and to cities including Southampton and Peterborough. RSC creative assistants also go into schools to work with pupils on the play.</p>    <p>Jacqui O’Hanlon, the RSC’s director of creative learning and engagement, said access to arts in schools was at a crossroads after years of erosion – but culture was all the more vital as a way of people understanding one another better. “We need a society able to disagree agreeably.”</p> <p>After the performance, Nkhanise Phiri, who played the Fool, was beaming. She had begun the day clinging to the arms of her seat on the Scilly ferry as it lurched, trying to pretend it was a fun rollercoaster. But it had been worth it.</p> <p>“It’s really important to bring Shakespeare to areas like this and make it accessible. It feels different being on an island. You’re aware of the water, the rain, nature. You have to adjust to each space, each audience. It’s a challenge – but good.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jensen Huang, the co-founder and chief executive of the US AI chipmaker Nvidia, has predicted “the UK is going to be an AI superpower” as he announced a new £500m investment in a British firm.</p> <p>Huang, who is due to join Donald Trump at Wednesday night’s state banquet with the king, said he was taking an equity stake in NScale, a UK cloud computing company, and predicted it would earn revenues of up to £50bn over the next six years.</p> <p>“We’re here to announce that the UK is going to be an AI superpower,” he told a press conference in London.</p> <p>Huang cited as evidence of Britain’s potential its universities and several companies founded in the UK, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/demis-hassabis-ai-future-10-times-bigger-than-industrial-revolution-and-10-times-faster\">the AI giant DeepMind</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/07/uk-ai-startup-wayve-funding-self-driving-softbank\">driverless car startup Wayve</a>. “You just don’t appreciate it. Your universities. Come on. You’re too humble,” he said.</p> <p>The semiconductor boss spoke as China moved to ban its biggest AI firms from buying Nvidia chips, in a sign of the growing geopolitical battle to gain dominance in AI.</p> <p>Huang said he was “disappointed” at reports that Beijing was bringing in the ban, adding: “It is safer for the world that China and the United States collaborate in AI, and Chinese researchers collaborate in AI than to isolate.”</p> <p>He said Nvidia was selling 120,000 graphics processing units to the UK as part of an investment amounting to £11bn, with 70% of that cost coming from computing and networking, including the chips, and 30% going on land, power and the structures of the datacentre.</p> <p>Huang said the combined additional computing power would be “approximately 100 times the performance of the fastest supercomputer in the UK right now, the Isambard AI supercomputer [in Bristol]”.</p> <p>He also stepped into a row over how AI companies treat artists’ copyrighted material, which has been used wholesale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/why-are-creatives-fighting-uk-government-ai-proposals-on-copyright\">to train AI systems</a>, saying: “Artists should have the ability to monetise their creation … we have to find ways for them to continue to do so.”</p> <p>Elton John and Mick Jagger were among a swathe of high-profile artists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/16/top-uk-artists-urge-starmer-to-protect-their-work-on-eve-of-trump-visit\">this week complained Labour had failed to defend artists’ basic rights</a> by blocking attempts to force artificial intelligence firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.</p> <p>Huang’s upbeat statement about Britain’s AI superpower future was tempered by a warning that “a challenge” remained to secure enough electricity to fuel the necessary wave of power-hungry data factories. He said nuclear power and gas turbine power stations would be needed.</p> <p>He also urged the UK to develop its own AI systems, despite the huge wave of US investment from Microsoft, Google and OpenAI announced this week.</p> <p>“Every country should create its own AI … I think the UK will have to do the same. The data belongs to you. It belongs to your people. It’s created by your people, your companies. And you should be able to … transform that data into your national interest,” he said.</p>",

In one case from July, a deaf car wash worker was arrested by Ice during an <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-22/ice-arrests-daca-recipient-at-california-car-wash\">immigration raid</a> in California, despite his Daca status and valid work authorization.</p> <p>In August, Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago, a Daca recipient and immigrant rights organizer in Texas, was detained by agents and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/15/texas-immigration-activist-daca-detention-el-paso-xochitl-santiago/\">later placed in Ice detention</a>, while the government fights to deport her.</p> <p>And in another instance, an unnamed man was arrested during a traffic stop and <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article310337645.html\">sent to</a> the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in the Florida Everglades known for its harsh conditions, despite his Daca status and valid driver’s license.</p> <p>“These are only the cases brought to the public’s attention,” the letter reads. “Given the scale of immigration enforcement operations and the lack of transparency around DHS and Ice procedures under the current Trump administration, it is reasonable to believe that additional Daca recipients have been detained or deported.”</p> <p>Other signatories include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ro Khanna, Greg Casar, Debbie Wasserman Shultz, Ritchie Torres, Summer Lee, Nydia Velázquez, Jamie Raskin, Ilhan Omar, Bennie Thompson and dozens more, representing states across the nation.</p> <p>The representatives also requested information on the legal authority used by the administration to detain Daca recipients, details of the arrests and how the department is looking to address what they regard as wrongful arrests.</p> <p>They said recent enforcement actions go against the spirit of Daca but “also disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs”.</p> <p>Donald Trump tried to end the program during his first presidency, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/daca-supreme-court-decision-trump-dreamers\">was stopped</a> by the US supreme court in 2020. The Department of Education earlier this year said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/23/trump-university-daca-admissions\">investigating five universities</a> for offering scholarships to Daca recipients.</p> <p>In January, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled that current Daca recipients remain protected and that DHS should treat them as low priorities for deportation.</p> <p>Daca recipients must renew their protection every two years and go through a vetting process to make sure they are still eligible. More than 500,000 Daca recipients currently live in the US, according to <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/immigration-and-citizenship-data?topic_id%5B%5D=33602&amp;ddt_mon=&amp;ddt_yr=&amp;items_per_page=100&amp;query=\">government data</a>.</p> <p>This year, a number of organizations released a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/10th-annual-daca-survey-2024-findings-reveal-whats-at-stake-for-recipients-and-the-united-states/\">survey of hundreds of Daca recipients</a> – the 10th annual survey of its kind – and found high employment and school enrollment. The majority of those surveyed also expressed fear of deportation, including because of safety concerns in their countries of birth.</p> <p>The representatives’ letter comes two days after Ramirez and Garcia co-wrote another letter to House leadership, encouraging them to co-sponsor the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1589/text\">American Dream and Promise Act</a> 2025, which would offer further protection for those with Daca and temporary protected status (TPS) and a “legislative pathway toward permanent status” in the US.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Super League’s proposed expansion to 14 teams is facing an 11th-hour challenge from clubs amid fears it could jeopardise the future of rugby league as a professional sport.</p> <p>Hull KR and Hull FC voted against expansion at Headingley in July, but other clubs are now understood to have expressed doubts about the Rugby Football League’s plans and want to “press the pause button” until 2027.</p> <p>The concerns centre on the financial sustainability of a 14-team Super League and the RFL’s failure to share a detailed business plan with the clubs. The Guardian has learned that while the RFL leadership gave a presentation at an informal owners’ meeting before the vote in July, multiple requests from several clubs for a detailed financial analysis underpinning expansion have gone unanswered.</p> <p>No documents were provided at the formal shareholders’ meeting where the vote took place, and the minutes of that meeting have not been shared.</p>    <p>There has been some discussion among the unhappy clubs about calling an extraordinary general meeting to demand a revote, but their efforts are currently focused on lobbying behind the scenes. Informal meetings between some clubs and the RFL are understood to have been scheduled for this week.</p> <p>“We’re not against going to 14 <em>per se</em>, but it has to be done properly,” one club source said. “We went to a meeting without being given any papers and haven’t received the financial modelling. The whole thing is being rushed and the process has not been robust enough.</p> <p>“An expansion process in other competitions, such as the NRL in Australia, takes years but the RFL are trying to do it in a matter of weeks. The panel appointed to determine Super League membership have not been given enough time to scrutinise the applications properly. We should press the pause button to make sure our sport is financially viable for the long term.”</p> <p>The application process for a place in next season’s Super League closed last Friday, six weeks after the vote for expansion. The decision on the new Super League clubs, which could number three if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/22/salford-stumble-on-in-crisis-with-their-future-on-the-line-and-fans-demanding-answers\">financially troubled Salford Red Devils </a>are expelled from the competition, will be announced in another five weeks on 16 October, five days after this year’s Grand Final, after assessments by an independent panel chaired by the Conservative peer Jonathan Caine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2025/aug/07/expanding-super-league-14-teams-clubs-idea\">Expanding Super League to 14 teams is unpopular. But it might just work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition to the quick turnaround there are also concerns about how the expansion will be funded. Sky Sports has made clear it will not increase its rights fee, and there are fears the company will lower its offer when its three-year contract expires next season, having already cut its annual rights fee from £40m to £21.5m since 2021.</p> <p>“Sky don’t want expansion, and we should be wary of alienating them,” another source said. “Most clubs are losing money, and the main broadcaster doesn’t want it, so why are we expanding? It doesn’t make sense. If the Sky money goes down, then some clubs may have to go part-time.</p>    <p>“The finances of Super League clubs are fragile, and one of our shareholders is facing potential insolvency. In that context, I find it perplexing that we have not been provided with a rigorous financial analysis of the impact of expansion.”</p> <p>An RFL spokesperson said: “The clubs have been considering an expansion of Super League for over a year and across many meetings. This led to the meeting at Headingley in July at which the 12 Betfred Super League clubs received the rationale, including financial, and voted overwhelmingly in favour.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Study shines light on growing numbers of vulnerable people being placed in solitary confinement in migrant jails</p>",
    "content": "<p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) put more than 10,500 people in solitary confinement between April 2024 and May 2025, and use of the practice has quickly increased under Donald Trump’s administration, according to new research.</p> <p>A report from Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), the Peeler Immigration Lab, and Harvard Law School experts, published on Wednesday, sheds light on what’s happening inside US immigrant detention facilities and how increasing numbers of vulnerable people are being subjected to solitary confinement for longer periods of time.</p> <p>The United Nations has found that solitary confinement, which is defined within the report as keeping people in small cells without “meaningful human contact” for at least 22 hours a day, amounts to psychological torture when such placements last longer than 15 days.</p> <p>The report spans a period of time that includes the Biden and the second Trump administration, but shows a spike in the use of solitary confinement in recent months. It comes comes as the president enacts his mass deportation agenda and rapidly expands US immigration enforcement activities and detention facilities.</p> <p>“We certainly have seen an increase in solitary confinement over the last years, but we’ve seen a significant increase from month to month during Trump’s first four months,” said Arevik Avedian, a Harvard law school lecturer and one of the authors of Cruelty Campaign: Solitary Confinement in US Immigration Detention.</p> <p>The research reveals that in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the use solitary confinement grew by an average of 6.5% each month; more than six times the average monthly increase seen during the final months of Joe Biden’s administration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the number of vulnerable people placed in solitary confinement, such as those with health problems or mental health conditions, rose by 56% in fiscal year 2025 when compared with 2022. Of people with vulnerabilities, placements “lasted more than twice as long as they did in the first fiscal quarter of 2022”.</p> <p>“Perhaps one of the worst findings was that people with vulnerabilities are being placed in solitary confinement twice as long as they would be placed when I started providing this data back in 2021,” Avedian said. “It’s a lot worse conditions, despite all the policies to only put people with vulnerabilities in solitary confinement when there’s no other choice.”</p> <p>Since Trump took office in January, authorities have arrested more than 210,000 people and deported more than 216,000, according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data\">published by the Guardian</a>. The number of detainees climbed to a record high this summer, with nearly 60,000 people still in custody across the country as of 8 September.</p> <p>The figures underpinning the report come from the government’s own statistics on the use of solitary confinement from publicly available Ice data as well as from public records requests. The researchers were aided by new federal reporting requirements, implemented last December, that offered an “unprecedented window into the scale and scope of solitary confinement” in US immigrant detention centers, but the authors warn that the report ultimately likely understates the true scope because of Ice’s “flawed data and reporting systems.”</p> <p>US immigrant detention capacity is set to rapidly expand as Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, signed into law in July, dedicated $170bn for immigration and border operations, and made Ice the largest and most heavily funded federal law enforcement agency.</p> <p>“This massive expansion of resources for a system already characterized by torturous conditions, combined with little to no oversight, creates the conditions for catastrophic human rights violations on an unprecedented scale,” the authors write.</p> <p>The report also includes an in-depth analysis of facilities in New England, where researchers found that almost three out of four solitary confinement placements were 15 days or longer and that people, on average, were isolated for about a month. The analysis of individual cases found the “systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes”, such as punishing people who had filed grievances or reported sexual assault, and requested basic needs such as showers.</p> <p>The lingering effects of solitary confinement can be disastrous, including “severe and often irreparable psychological and physical consequences”, according to the UN, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, lasting brain damage, hallucinations and increased suicide risk.</p> <p>Researchers highlighted the case of Charles Leo Daniel, <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/immigrant-who-died-in-ice-custody-spent-13-years-in-solitary-many-in-wa-prisons/\">who died in Ice custody</a> last year after spending more than 13 years of his life in solitary confinement in different prison facilities, including his final four years in Ice detention. The 61-year-old from Trinidad and Tobago, who died of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, had served one of the longest periods in isolation in Ice custody since 2018, according to a report from the Center for Human Rights at the University of Washington.</p> <p>The authors of Cruelty Campaign issued a series of recommendations for the federal government policymakers, such as ending solitary confinement and stopping the expansion of immigration detention centers.</p> <p>The issue is not new, said Katherine Peeler, a medical adviser with Physicians for Human Rights and one of the report’s authors, but it is getting worse in terms of the numbers and the “callousness and impunity with which it’s being carried out” while protections are being rolled back.</p> <p>“I just hope the public understands the duality of worsening policies and procedures and actions in the context of decreased oversight,” Peeler said. “These are people who are coming to our country seeking help, who are contributing to our economy, who are our neighbors, who play soccer with our kids, and it’s important to recognize that humanity and treat people accordingly.”</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice, for comment.</p>",

Adjusted profit before tax increased by 26.8% to £488.3m.</p> <p>Thomas said: “We have delivered a solid performance in a tough market, with adjusted profits ahead of expectations despite home completions coming in slightly below our guided range.”</p> <p>The group expects to complete between 17,200 and 17,800 homes this year, assuming a normal autumn selling season. However, it cautioned that “the extended period through to the budget and related uncertainties around general taxation and that applicable to housing, has introduced additional risk”.</p> <p>Analysts fear would-be buyers could hold off as they wait for clarity on potential changes in stamp duty and other taxes in the autumn budget, which is scheduled for 26 November. The Westminster set-piece will take place a month later than last year, when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, presented her first budget in late October.</p> <p>Thomas said Barratt’s acquisition of Redrow was “transformative” for the group, and had produced cost savings ahead of its targets (£69m out of £100m), adding that the integration was now largely complete. Six divisional offices have been closed and three more are closing.</p> <p>He emphasised that “it is vital that government policy is focused on reforming the planning system, removing barriers to investment and supporting purchasers, particularly first-time buyers, if the sector is to build the homes the country needs”.</p> <p>Last year, the government set an ambitious target of building 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing. In June this year, the then housing secretary Angela Rayner nearly doubled spending on affordable housing to £39bn. It is unclear whether Rayner’s recent resignation has affected housebuilders’ confidence in government policies.</p> <p>Average house prices in the UK were 2.8% higher in July than a year earlier, down from 3.6% price growth in June, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics, released this morning.</p> <p>Growth has slowed sharply since hitting a two-year high in March, when buyers rushed to complete sales before a tax break on house purchases expired.</p> <p>According to Nationwide Building Society, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/01/uk-house-prices-fall-mortgage-costs-august-nationwide\">house prices unexpectedly fell in August</a>, with continued high mortgage costs dampening activity.</p> <p>Rents charged by private landlords increased by 5.7% year-on-year in August, down from an annual rate of 5.9% in July, the smallest annual increase since December 2022.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Few sporting debuts have arrived with as much hype, but Australian sprint sensation Gout Gout passed his first test at a major global meet by booking a place in the semi-finals of the World Championships in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>The 17-year-old handled the pressure under the bright lights of Japan’s National Stadium, powering home in a time of 20.23 seconds to grab the third qualifying place in the fifth of six heats.</p> \n<p>He finished behind Jamaica’s Bryan Levell and Zimbabwe’s Makanakaishe Charamba, the only two athletes in the heat higher than his world ranking of 16.</p> \n<p>Gout started slowly and was quickly caught by Levell on his inside, but found his stride and comfortably claimed third in a time two-tenths off his personal best of 20.02sec.</p> \n<p>“The start’s obviously not my strong suit but as soon as I get into running I’m chilling,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Everyone wasn’t up against me apart from the top two, so I just hit cruise control last 50, last 30, and just … big Q [automatic qualifier], so that’s what I needed.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2025/09/gout-raceoff-2025/atom-1\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The result sets up a tantalising test for the teenager against the world’s best in one of three semi-finals on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Torrie Lewis also progressed to the semis in the women’s event, underlining Australia’s potential in one of the sport’s marquee events.</p> \n<p>The other Australians in the event failed to progress. The 21-year-old Aidan Murphy came home sixth in his heat, stopping the clock at 20.54sec, 12 hundredths off his best.

And I knew if I had gone up to the media box, then I would have cried and I just didn’t want to cry on TV.”</p> \n<p>Her time was the eighth fastest among all qualifiers, suggesting she will be in contention for a spot in the final when the competition continues on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Lewis moved to the Netherlands this year to train with Laurent Meuwly alongside a group of top Dutch athletes and is in career-best form.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been acting a lot more professional than I was [when I was living] in Brisbane, so I feel like it was just, athletic-wise, a step-up for me, and I think it’s showing.”</p> \n<p>It was less than a quarter of a second outside Melinda Gainsford-Taylor’s national record of 22.23sec set in 1997.</p> \n<p>Mia Gross finished eighth in her heat with a time of 23.24sec – half a second slower than her PB – after struggling to get out of the blocks, and now looks forward to the 4x400m relay on the weekend.</p> \n<p>Kristie Edwards, who is in the 4x100m squad, was also eliminated after running a 23.39sec.</p> \n<p>American Anavia Battle was the fastest qualifier with a time of 22.07sec.</p> \n<p>The gold medallist from 2023 in Budapest, Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson, progressed comfortably with a time of 22.33sec.</p>",

    "content": "<h2>‘A dolphin among sharks’</h2> <p>I met Bob in 1984 after he finished Out of Africa through a mutual friend in Malibu, and subsequently began to work for him and became friends. At that time he was establishing Sundance and distancing himself from Hollywood. He was a dolphin among sharks. He was the most kind and wise person one could ever know in this life.<br><strong>Lex,</strong><strong> Joshua Tree, CA</strong></p> <h2>‘His impact on film-making in New Mexico will have a lasting impact’</h2> <p>Robert Redford generously supported the Milagro at Los Luceros project in New Mexico. His generosity and vision helped underrepresented Native American, Hispanic and female writers to create screenplays, books and films under the guidance of writer and director, Joan Tewkesbury. His impact on film-making and the environment in New Mexico will have a lasting impact. <br><strong>Jean</strong><strong>, New Mexico</strong></p> <h2>‘At my PhD graduation, my mum was more excited about being in the same room as Bob’</h2> <p>Robert Redford was an honorary graduate at my PhD graduation at Trinity College Dublin in 2008. Despite my four years of hard graft and being the first member of my family to achieve the title “Dr”, my mum was far more excited about being in the same room as her heart-throb, “Bob”. I was a little put out by his presence outshining my special moment until I got called up and was greeted with a wink and a smile from Dr Redford. Yes, I went a bit weak at the knees. But don’t tell my mum I said that. <br><strong>Catriona, 45, university professor, Helston, Cornwall</strong></p> <h2>‘Every inch the movie star’</h2> <p>In 1978, producer Richard Drewett and I made a film [called <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-outlaw-trail-with-robert-redford/\">The Outlaw Trail</a>] with Robert Redford. He was a week late arriving for the shoot, sweeping up the road to his home above Sundance, sun-tanned in blue denim, driving a silver Porsche<em><strong> </strong></em> convertible – every inch the movie star. His excuse for the wait? “I had the chance to spend some time with my son James.” <br><strong>Alan Ravenscroft, 78, retired documentary-maker</strong></p> <h2>‘The waiter told him The Great Escape was his favourite movie’</h2> <p>In the 2000s, Robert Redford had dinner with his partner at the Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat in the south of France at the table next to ours. At some point the waiter bent down and told him that The Great Escape was his favourite movie. Robert took it with good grace, thanked the waiter, took a sip of his vodka martini and had a good giggle once the waiter had departed. <br><strong>Susanne, 54, former financial trader, London</strong></p> <h2>‘I helped him to an auditorium seat to watch his son graduate’</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/robert-redford-all-the-presidents-men-reporter-bob-woodward\">Robert Redford was ‘a principled force for good’, says All the President’s Men reporter Bob Woodward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mr Redford’s son was a year ahead of me in high school and I served as a junior usher at his class’s graduation. I got to lead Mr Redford and his wife to seats in the auditorium. It was a brief, polite, non-substantive interaction, but it amused me that, after all the movie-house seats to which I had made my way to watch his films, I was helping him find an auditorium seat to watch his son graduate. <br><strong>Robert, New York</strong></p> <h2>‘Paul Newman recommended he go to the National Film Theatre’</h2> <p>The most memorable event was Robert Redford’s appearance at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London in the 1970s [now the BFI]. I asked him why he had come: “Because,” Redford said, “I called Paul Newman [the actor and co-star in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid] and asked him what to do in London.” “You’ve got to go to the NFT,” said Newman, “they will treat you right and they know how to do it.” <br><strong>Deac</strong><strong>, London</strong></p> <h2>‘He set up an expectation that I had a lot to look forward to in the navy’</h2>    <p>I was a senior in college and already in the navy when I saw Robert Redford in The Way We Were. He was dazzlingly handsome in his navy uniform, it took my breath away. He immediately set up an expectation that I had a lot to look forward to in the navy! No one in my whole career ever looked as good in that uniform as he did. <br><strong>Patty, 73, retired navy nurse, Annapolis, MA</strong></p> <h2>‘He influenced a whole generation of skiers’</h2> <p>He influenced a whole generation of skiers to embrace the sport, to try amateur racing, to leave the East Coast to spend time in the magnificent mountains of the west and to believe that those vistas and wild places deserve our protection. Bravo Downhill Racer. <br><strong>Mary</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Pen Argyl</strong><strong>, PA</strong></p> <h2>‘Did you know he is the narrator at the planetarium in Kolkata, India?’</h2> <p>Did you know that the voice of the narrator at the planetarium in Kolkata, India, is Robert Redford’s? I took my kids there and came out of it feeling refreshed and hopeful. He made you believe that it might all turn out well, not by obscuring the truth but with his deeds and presence. <br><strong>Shreya Sen-Handley, author, Nottingham</strong></p>    <h2>‘He personified what a dignified man is’</h2> <p>I first saw Robert Redford in The Natural. He was a beautiful man and I don’t think anyone can compare to him, both on and off screen. He personified what a dignified man is, trying his best to make a better world. I could spend weeks just watching Redford in his movies and learn what it is to try and live a good life – as he tried in his own life. <br><strong>Khalid</strong><strong>, Dubai</strong></p> <h2>‘He apologised and laughed self-deprecatingly’</h2> <p>In early 2000 after working in a major art gallery in London for a few months, those of us on the frontline were pretty jaded when it came to celebrities. Then one evening, just before closing, a ripple went along the line of desks as a man walked past. People burst into fits of nervous giggles, their cheeks flushed. The man asked to buy a ticket to the special exhibition and it fell to my poor boss to tell him the museum was closing. The man apologised, laughed self-deprecatingly and headed for the exit. Even that short exchange demonstrated what a lovely, self-effacing man Robert Redford was. They don’t make them like that any more.<strong> <br>Clare, 55, unemployed, Kendal, Cumbria</strong></p> <h2>‘Ordinary in his extraordinariness’</h2> <p>The guy was a star. He came from an era when the term carried a sense of mystery, excitement and awe that has long since disappeared from our world. Redford had magic. Ordinary in his extraordinariness.</p> <p>Many know him from Sundance, Barefoot, The Sting etc. But I would recommend seeking out some of his lesser-known works. There’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/09/robert-redfords-greatest-screen-roles-ranked\">The Candidate</a>, where he plays a charming political wannabe who is desperate for high office and then unsure what to do when he gets there. Or Three Days of the Condor where he plays an everyman trying to navigate a world where government conspiracy and paranoia run rife.</p> <p>Add to this his concern for the environment, for decency, for humanity and for film through Sundance. And now he’s gone. Looking at the state of the world, perhaps it’s for the best. He seems almost too good for this place. <br><strong>John Socha, 55, English and film studies teacher, Gdansk, Poland</strong></p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/17/kerry-james-marshall-royal-academy-black-america",
    "description": "<p><strong>Royal Academy, London</strong> <br>Kidnappings, enslavement, cops and squad cars, golfers, picnics, croquet-players, interstellar travellers … the US artist’s largest ever European show takes in an extraordinary range of experience in a breathtaking show</p><p></p><p></p>",
    "content": "<p>Biting, funny, astonishing, difficult, surprising, erudite and hugely ambitious, Kerry James Marshall’s The Histories is the largest show of the black American’s work ever held in Europe. Its effects are cumulative. The Histories charts the 69-year-old painter’s intellectual as well as practical development, his themes, his switches of media and of focus and attention. Everything is here for a reason.</p> <p>How engaging Marshall’s art is, from the first. He takes us from the bar to the bedroom, to the Middle Passage, from the studio to the academy, from the beauty parlour to the dancehall. He paints scenes of kidnappings and of enslavement in Africa and of a black cop sitting on the hood of his squad car – I love the jagged stylised flare of the streetlights in the background. Marshall knows that everything is contended and complex and that there are no innocent images. Pustules of paint, like litter between the blocks, decorate the spaces between the housing projects, like flowers blooming in a riot. On an idyllic day in the park, black folks picnic, practise a golf swing, play croquet, water-ski on the lake and listen to the Temptations, the lyrics floating up like ticker tape from radios on a sunny afternoon. It is an absurd, impossible image. The humour in Marshall’s art is not to be underestimated. In a series devoted to the Middle Passage a Baptist flounders. There are water slides and swimming pools, ocean liners and toy boats and a woman about to dive from a board. The water is filled with drowned maps of Africa and carefully rendered fish, and there’s an exhortation to plunge.</p>    <p>The key early work here, and one that led to several variations, is Marshall’s 1980 egg tempera on paper A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self. The title alludes to James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and the slanting hat, tipped back on the subject’s head, may also echo Wyndham Lewis’s Tyro, from 1921. Gap-toothed and wide-eyed, a black face grins wildly. Dressed in black and wearing a black fedora, he looms from a black background. Only the white triangle of shirt at his collar, those eyes and that smile, punctuate the dark. This small work on paper is cartoonish, but also reserved and confrontational, bounded by a white mat in a black frame. He repainted it as an image-within-an-image, hung on a red wall above an old-fashioned upright vacuum cleaner, and called it Portrait of the Artist and a Vacuum. Where does the artist belong? Where’s their milieu, their audience, their culture? Studying at CalArts in California, where painting seemed to be definitively over, there was little if any acknowledgment of the artist’s blackness, or of the importance of art to a wider, let alone a wider black, audience. But Marshall was showing that even an old-fashioned egg tempera portrait was as conceptual as anything else. It is an essay in blackness, and also alludes to Ralph Ellison’s 1947 novel Invisible Man. These paintings were both an end point and the beginning of a career in which he has become the pre-eminent painter of black American life.</p> <p>Black Painting (2003) depicts a bedroom at night, the details only becoming apparent as your eyes adjust to the close-toned gloom. The painting is not black, but filled with tiny shifts in the darkness. Adjustments. There are bulks in there, shifts, bodies troubled in sleep. The viewer’s eye roams the gloom, an interloper, hovering by the pillow, noting the copy of Angela Davis’s If They Come in the Morning. What and who do the sleepers dread? It is a painting that waits and waits, a singularity amid an overwhelming multiplicity of signs, of innumerable crisp and telling details. Marshall’s art rewards attention, to its larger social and political themes, its momentous occasions and to its smaller stories.</p>    <p>Portraits and still life, looping descriptions of electrical flex, painted inventories of studio paraphernalia, gags about abstraction, old masterish riffs and quoted lyrics of Snoop Dogg, knuckle rings that spell “STUD”, magazine racks of Ebony and Jet all vie in this exhilarating and at times moving exhibition, filling the main galleries at the Royal Academy. And don’t forget the shoes: so many closely observed sneakers, mules, sandals, slip-ons, pumps and high heels. Even at his loosest, Marshall insists on the particular. There’s no end to the invention or the details that constantly arrest you.</p> <p>There are near monochromes and sly plays on abstract expressionism, couplings in the park, an Afrofuturist family evening on an interstellar spaceship and a woman with amazing hair happily nursing a drink in a bar. A guy sweeps the stage in a cavernous hall, where a woman stands in effortless emulation of the sad-eyed girl at the counter in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re\">Manet’s 1882 Bar at the Folies-Bergère</a>. Marshall’s figure clutches her bag and waits, but for what or who we do not know. Like Manet’s barmaid, she’s a witness to her time.</p> <p>A naked guy, dressed only in a jock strap, poses as though for a life class, one arm raised in a Black power salute. On a worktable nearby rests a woman’s handbag and a small doll, apparently a <em>nkisi nkondi</em> figure from the Kongo people of central Africa. Already there’s too much to resolve. And what of the knotted rope, rendered in glitter, dropping from above, or the big abstract canvases shunted to the edge of the painting, beyond the white and red and patterned drapes? And we haven’t yet mentioned the model’s blackness, his near impenetrable silhouette, the barely discernible lineaments of his body and face, his big hair, his unknowable expression. You could almost pick up the yellow glass on the table, the bag or the bunch of keys, but the model is somehow out of reach.</p>    <p>And so it goes, from painting to painting, from the studied portraits to the figures in motion, the naked guy lying on the bed, holding the red, black and green Pan-African flag over his genitals (my eyes snag on his patterned socks); the elderly ladies in their parlours, golden-winged like angels at an annunciation, with appliqué “we mourn our loss” tasselled hangings commemorating Martin Luther King, JFK and Bobby Kennedy. Little black kids and teenagers look at art in the museum, and two female black artists, their brushes hovering over palettes heavy with moiled and drooling piles of pigments, look as though they’re threatening to paint us. </p> <p>Many of the larger paintings are unstretched, fixed to the wall with grommets – like the paintings of Leon Golub, one of many ghosts at the feast of Marshall’s art, which is full of licks and nods to other artists. But it is the specifics that finally grab you. Seagulls catch the light on their wings, floating over the small boats drawn up on the shore, awaiting their human cargo destined for the Americas. Marshall’s paintings are filled with the imagined, the feared, the remembered, the repressed and the invented. They’re woven through with black history and culture, with aspiration and loss, a distant past that won’t go away and an entangled present. Everything is always impending. By turns ragged and precise, offhand and offbeat and concise, Marshall’s art is as necessary as it is unmissable.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kerry-james-marshall\">At the Royal Academy, London, 20 September to 18 January 2026</a></p>",

    "content": "<p>The scale of the Australian government’s climate action ambition for the next decade is expected to be set on Thursday with the anticipated release of its 2035 emissions reduction target.</p> <h2>Cutting emissions</h2> <p>The target was initially promised by February, but postponed until after the May election while the government waited on advice from the Climate Change Authority, a government agency chaired by former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The government is expected to announce the target at the same time it releases a barrage of reports, including the Climate Change Authority’s target advice, a plan to reach net zero by 2050 and an analysis of what can be done to cut pollution in six sectors of the economy, including electricity and energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land, resources and the built environment.</p> <p>New policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be announced alongside the new goal, which would build on the government’s 2030 target of a 43% reduction below 2005 levels.</p> <p>Views differ on whether the government is on track to meet that goal, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/albanese-government-says-australia-on-target-to-reduce-emissions-but-campaigners-say-they-could-do-more\">projections released in November </a>suggest the country is headed for a 42.6% cut – just shy of the legislated target.</p> <h2>Setting targets</h2> <p>The 2035 target matters not just in Australia, but internationally. It will be submitted to the UN as part of the country’s “nationally determined contribution”, or NDC – what the government says it can do to help the world meet goals in the 2015 Paris agreement. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has indicated Australia is likely to submit a range rather than a single number.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/31/former-un-climate-chief-urges-australia-to-set-prosperity-target-of-cutting-emissions-by-75-by-2035\">Former UN climate chief urges Australia to set ‘prosperity’ target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2035</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Paris deal includes a commitment that the target must be more ambitious than the existing 2030 goal – there can be no backsliding – and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. The Climate Change Authority released a consultation paper in April 2024 with its preliminary assessment, finding a cut of at least 65% and up to 75% “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/12/australia-could-reach-an-ambitious-emissions-cut-of-up-to-75-by-2035-advisers-tell-labor\">would be ambitious and could be achievable</a> if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”.</p> <p>Since then, the authority has been consulting experts and interest groups and has undertaken modelling to refine its advice. Its board – <a href=\"https://www.climatechangeauthority.gov.au/about-authority/who-we-are\">including scientists and business figures</a> – reached its final position last week and Bowen received the advice on Friday.</p> <p>The authority is required to consider what the best scientific advice says Australia should be doing to keep alive the goal of trying to limit global heating to 1.5C since preindustrial times. It should also consider the international political and diplomatic landscape, the economics of what’s possible, the pace of technological development and what is considered socially deliverable.</p> <p>From a scientific view, analyses have found Australia should make a percentage cut of somewhere between the high 70s and 100% – actually reaching net zero – by 2035. Australia’s Pacific island neighbours have also stressed the need for their more developed friend to be as ambitious as possible – and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/12/north-west-shelf-gas-project-extended-to-2070-with-partial-protection-for-indigenous-rock-art\">stop approving new fossil fuel developments</a>.</p> <p>Some of these analyses – including by the thinktank Climate Analytics and the Australian Conservation Foundation – have detailed estimates of how cuts could be made to meet a target of at least 75%. Climate campaigners generally believe the target range must include 75% to be credible.</p> <p>But other experts, such as Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, have argued that even a target of 65% would be ambitious, given it would require pollution to be cut in half over the next decade and progress to date <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/25/what-is-happening-with-australias-emissions-electricity-is-improving-transport-is-not\">has been much slower</a>. He said the introduction and implementation of policies to transform the economy was more important than the number.</p> <p>Business organisations are politically influential and vary markedly in their positions. One group of about 500 that includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Ikea and Unilever has argued strongly for 75%. Others have emphasised the cost of action and pitched for a goal in the 50s.</p> <p>The Business Council of Australia issued a veiled warning about setting a target in the 60s or 70s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/04/australia-needs-530bn-capital-to-meet-70-climate-goal-business-council-claims-ahead-of-new-2035-target\">publishing modelling suggesting between $395bn and $530bn</a> of capital investment would be needed.</p> <h2>International action</h2> <p>The picture across developed countries is mixed. The US (a little more than 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action.</p> <p>The UK has a 2035 goal equivalent to a 78% cut below 2005 levels, and the EU is expected to land in the 70s. But Japan, Canada and New Zealand have set much lower targets (59%, 45-50%, 51-55% below 2005 levels respectively).</p> <p>As an emerging economy, China – the world’s biggest national polluter – has not yet set targets on the scale of those nations that developed earlier. Its current goal is that its pollution will peak by 2030.</p> <p>Some analyses suggest that might have already happened as it builds extraordinary amounts of renewable energy and uses less coal power (even as it continues to build new plants). There is a focus before the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November on what Beijing will promise to do by 2035.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/13/chris-bowens-defining-climate-moment-is-nigh-and-he-knows-what-it-means-if-we-get-it-wrong\">In an interview</a>, Bowen pointed to a 2021 calculation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that suggested global emissions needed to be cut by 60% between 2019 and 2035 to keep the 1.5C goal on the table. That translates to a 68% cut below 2005 levels – the baseline used by Australia.</p> <p>Global heating has accelerated since that report was released and 68% is a planet-wide average, suggesting developed countries such as Australia would need to do more to be aligned with the 1.5C goal.</p> <h2>The climate risk</h2> <p>The problem that was trying to be addressed was spelt out in detail on Monday in the first national climate risk assessment, released by Bowen and developed by the Australian Climate Service.</p> <p>It modelled the impact of climate-related hazards such as heatwaves, drought and floods on different parts of the community, economy and environment under three global heating scenarios: above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C. Modelling found under the 1.5C scenario alone the annual direct cost could of floods, bushfires, storms and cyclones could reach $40bn by 2050.</p> <p>The assessment found deaths from heatwaves – the deadliest form of extreme weather event – could rise significant under higher temperatures and sea level rise meant more than 1.5 million people could be living in areas at risk of coastal flooding in 2050.</p> <p>Financial systems, supply chains, infrastructure, primary industries and national security could all face substantial disruption. On the natural environment, it reinforced that Australia was likely to lose ecosystems and species by the middle of the century and this could affect people’s access to clean air, water and food.</p> <p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the findings would inform the 2035 target while also stressed the need to plan for an “orderly” transition to avoid losing public support for climate action.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A film examining the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans-clergy-abuse\">Catholic clergy molestation crisis in New Orleans</a> recently won the prize for best documentary at Colorado’s Winter Park film festival and has been chosen to be screened in the city where the scandal has unfolded.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/god-as-my-witness-documentary-raindance-festival\">God As My Witness</a> makes “clear that those who commit these atrocities cannot hide” while giving “a voice to the survivors, justice to the abused and a platform to be heard,” the Winter Park film festival’s director, Connor Nelson, said in a statement.</p> <p>Nelson’s statement said both of the film’s screenings at his festival in early September – which is based in part on reporting by the Guardian and its New Orleans media partner WWL Louisiana – sold out while leaving some audience members in tears. He also remarked that question-and-answer sessions with the documentary’s filmmakers, cast and crew “went far beyond anything we’ve experienced at the festival, … showing … that these conversations are necessary”.</p> <p>The 82-minute documentary was directed by New Orleans native Lindsay Quinn Pitre and produced by Michael Brandner Sr, who in 2018 discovered a pile of what were essentially love letters to his younger brother from a Roman Catholic priest now recognized by the New Orleans church as a credibly accused child molester.</p> <p>Brandner’s brother, Scot, who was a teenager when he received the letters in question from Brian Highfill, never told anyone about them and died by suicide at age 29 in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Michael presented the letters to New Orleans’ Catholic archbishop, Gregory Aymond. On a recorded phone call between the men, Aymond told Brandner that the letters were concerning but not “explicit enough” to warrant Highfill’s inclusion on a list released by the archdiocese that identified clergymen faced with substantial allegations of child molestation.</p> <p>Aymond ultimately added Highfill to that list in October 2020 after WWL and a reporter now at the Guardian questioned the archdiocese about at least three other people who had reported their own allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of the clergyman over the previous 18 years.</p> <p>God As My Witness recounts the Brandner family’s experience with Highfill, who died in 2018, as well as the stories of a number of people who endured being sexually abused as children by clergymen while being raised Catholic in New Orleans, building in part on reporting published by the Guardian alongside WWL. It also tells the stories of certain attorneys who have represented clergy abuse survivors against the New Orleans archdiocese after the church faced so many clerical molestation claims that it filed for federal bankruptcy protection in May 2020.</p> <p>The bankruptcy remained unresolved as of Wednesday, though more than 600 clergy abuse claimants who are involved in the case have started voting on whether to accept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/new-orleans-archdiocese-sex-abuse-settlement-bankruptcy\">a settlement offer</a> guaranteeing $230m in compensation in a process that runs through 29 October.</p> <p>Pitre, Brandner, their team and some of the subjects of God As My Witness accepted the Winter Park film festival’s best documentary award on 7 September. Brandner said it was uniquely emotional to see some of the survivors profiled in the film accept the award.</p> <p>“They converted from a victim to a survivor to a hero,” Brandner said. “It was truly beautiful and brought tears to my eyes.”</p> <p>God As My Witness had previously collected a best feature documentary nomination at June’s Raindance film festival in London, where it made its world premiere.</p> <p>It has also been screened at Portugal’s Cinema em Locais Inusitado e Temporarios film festival, where the Catholic bishop of the diocese of Setúbal, Cardinal Américo Aguiar, authorized for it to be shown in his private chapel. Among those in the audience was Grupo Vita, a Portuguese national support group for Catholic clergy abuse survivors.</p> <p>A statement from the Portugal festival director, Luìs Teixiera, said God As My Witness’ “local approach of a global topic succeeds in making it universal”.</p> <p>Among other showings on the fest circuit, Pitre said God As My Witness is tentatively scheduled to be screened at the <a href=\"https://nofs.eventive.org/films/689ea6a8780187744584d547\">2025 New Orleans film festival</a>, which is set to be held from 23 to 27 October. She said she understands tickets to that festival are scheduled to begin going on sale in about the second week of October.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jocelyn Smith watched Congress debate Donald Trump’s domestic spending bill, the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” with trepidation this summer – wondering what the bill’s passage would mean for her daughter, who receives care for her juvenile epilepsy under Medicaid.</p> <p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do with her medicine, it’s so expensive,” Smith said. “It’s a lot of what-ifs.”</p> <p>Now 18, her daughter Aibhie was diagnosed with juvenile epilepsy when she was 11 years old. Since then, she and her mother have mastered the three-hour drive between their home in Roswell, New Mexico, and the nearest neurologist in Albuquerque – hoping to find a medication combination that would suppress Aibhie’s monthly seizures.</p> <p>In November, surgeons implanted a vagus nerve stimulator under the skin in Aibhie’s chest – the device is frequently used to help control medication-resistant seizures. But, Smith says, Aibhie’s still having two to three seizures a month – too many to live alone or drive, hold down regular hours at a job or go away to college.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/medicaid-caregivers-trump-cuts\">‘I don’t know how we would survive’: caregivers speak of fears over upcoming Medicaid cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of these costs were covered by Medicaid. In the United States, children can remain on their parents’ Medicaid coverage until they turn 19 in most states (some states, like California, extend that age limit to 21, and 26 for former foster youth).</p> <p>“I was sitting on my hands watching this bill being voted through and I was pretty much in tears because I’m like, ‘Wow, what’s going to happen if this passes?’ and sure enough it passed,” Smith said.</p> <p>Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spending bill will cut federal spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) by <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61533\">$1.02tn</a>, and remove <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Arrington-Guthrie-Letter-Medicaid.pdf\">at least 10.5 million people</a> from the programs over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A significant number of those affected are likely to be children: <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31491/AAP-analysis-49-of-children-insured-by-Medicaid-or?autologincheck=redirected\">half of all children</a> in the United States are covered through Medicaid or Chip. Although children make up a quarter of the United States population, they account for <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet#:~:text=NHE%20by%20Age%20Group%20and,and%20over%2060%20percent%20respectively.\">only about 10%</a> of the country’s total healthcare spending.</p>    <p>The spending bill “really puts kids last”, said Bruce Lesley, president of the bipartisan children’s advocacy group First Focus Campaign for Children. “If our goal is to get all children covered, we are taking giant steps backward in this bill.”</p> <p>Those health impacts are likely to be felt especially strongly in New Mexico - where residents rely on Medicaid at the highest rate per capita in the nation. More than 40% of New Mexicans, or 878,000 people, are enrolled in the program. Almost <a href=\"https://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-NM\">two-thirds of the state’s children</a> are covered under Medicaid.</p> <p>“We’re potentially the hardest hit,” said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of the non-profit New Mexico Voices for Children. “In New Mexico, the federal government pays $3 for every $1 New Mexico spends on its [Medicaid] program,” she adds, making New Mexico the state most dependent on federal Medicaid match dollars.</p> <p>“It’s very scary,” said Smith, who worries her daughter will lose coverage, just as she enters adulthood. “I don’t see how people are supposed to live.”</p> <p>Smith, 44, and her daughter have been insured under Medicaid for a few years now, since Smith’s own health deteriorated, sending her to the emergency room for monthly visits as the symptoms of her Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis worsened. Smith works as a video producer at her local radio station, and volunteers with food distribution and housing programs.</p> <p>After her application for Medicaid was approved, Smith said, “I was able to start seeing doctors again and was able to see what was going on, and try to get back on medication.”</p> <p>Medicaid also covered her daughter’s care when Smith had to scale back her hours at work to get medical treatment. Aibhie was also recently approved for coverage under Social Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI.</p> <p>But the nearest specialists were hours away and the expense of gas to travel there added up. Smith and her ex-husband had moved back to her home town of Roswell after their daughter and older son were born. They hoped having family nearby would help them save on childcare costs, which felt out of reach in the larger Texas cities where they had lived. Now, Smith found herself in a rural area that put her too far away from the medical specialists she and her daughter required.</p> <p>“In order for these surgeries to happen, we have to take off of work,” said Smith. “We just can’t afford to continuously be going up there. It’s really hard for us to make that trip.”</p> <p>Advocates worry that all rural families, not only those on Medicaid, will be affected by cuts to the program. An analysis prepared by the Cecil G Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina for US Senate staff <a href=\"https://www.tricityrecordnm.com/articles/u-s-senators-warn-15-new-mexico-hospitals-likely-to-close-if-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-become-law/\">found</a> that 15 rural hospitals in New Mexico (and 300 across the country) could shutter as a result of Medicaid cuts in the domestic spending bill.</p> <p>“There’s not one hospital for people who are on Medicaid and a different hospital for those who are not,” said Uballez, who notes that rural hospitals are highly dependent on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open. “You pull the people who are on Medicaid and it unravels everything else for everybody else.”</p> <p>Aibhie is able to see a neurologist at the University of New Mexico, which Medicaid reimburses the family for. Most of her appointments can happen by video call. But last November she and her mother traveled to Albuquerque to have the vagus nerve stimulator implanted.</p>    <p>“Luckily Medicaid did pay for our motel, so we were able to stay there for two days,” said Smith. “But that’s just a motel. That doesn’t cover food, that doesn’t cover gas. It’s a pretty rough surgery and we just couldn’t afford to go back and forth.”</p> <p>Aibhie’s neurologist had hoped the device would significantly reduce the frequency of her seizures, though that hasn’t proved the case so far. While she navigates more medication changes, Aibhie’s had to quit her first job as a barista – her seizures proved too disruptive.</p> <p>“She is on some very expensive medicine and of course this device is pretty expensive,” said Smith. “I don’t know how we would even begin to cover that if she was to be cut off” from Medicaid.</p> <p>“I can’t even afford to get my medicine at this point because of copays,” said Smith. She’s going without it, despite the pain, but is quick to add: “My daughter is a different story because that’s medicine to basically make her live.”</p> <p>Before Congress established the Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-impact-of-the-childrens-health-insurance-program-chip-what-does-the-research-tell-us/\">about 14% of American children</a> were uninsured. Lesley of the First Focus Campaign for Children remembers that the program also forced lawmakers to reconsider Medicaid policies, spurring them to simplify enrollment, allow retroactive coverage for babies and coordinate benefits between programs. By 2016, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/key-issues-in-childrens-health-coverage/\">the uninsured rate for kids dropped to an all-time low</a> of 5%.</p> <p>“And then the Trump administration came in and we started a series of rollbacks,” he said. In Trump’s first term, the administration invited states <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/trump-administrations-harmful-changes-to-medicaid\">to submit waivers</a> to cut Medicaid funding and <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/trump-administrations-harmful-changes-to-medicaid\">implemented work requirements</a>. In 2018, the US census reported that the uninsured rate for children had crept up to 5.5%, “largely because of a decline in public coverage”.</p>    <p>There’s no government estimate of how many children will lose insurance coverage under the new domestic spending bill, says Lesley. But based on how many children are insured through Medicaid or Chip, he expects “there’s probably going to be a disparate impact on kids”. Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2025/deep-medicaid-spending-cuts-put-health-care-coverage-risk-one-five-enrolled-children\">estimate</a> that one in five of those enrolled children could be at risk of losing coverage.</p> <p>Soon after the domestic spending bill passed, New Mexico state legislators <a href=\"https://sourcenm.com/2025/04/29/new-mexico-lawmakers-brace-for-steep-cuts-to-federal-funding/\">formed a committee</a> to study how federal cuts will affect the state’s budget. On 1 October, the legislature will meet for <a href=\"https://www.governor.state.nm.us/2025/09/04/governor-announces-special-session-to-begin-oct-1/\">a special session</a> convened by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to address upcoming Medicaid enrollment changes.</p> <p>Although New Mexico is likely to feel the greatest effects of budget cuts, Uballez says, “we’re also a state that has a legislature that’s done a really good job at saving money for a rainy day.” She points to trust funds the legislature has established that invest state revenue, largely from oil and gas money, in order to pay for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/childcare-new-mexico-poverty\">early childhood education</a>, housing and other social programs.</p> <p>In August, Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary under Joe Biden who is running to replace Lujan Grisham when the current governor’s term expires in 2026, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNEobrzMkZ-/\">told voters</a>: “We’re told we need to save our money for a rainy day. Newsflash: it’s pouring. It’s time New Mexico put its abundance of state funds to use investing in our communities, making life more affordable, improving our schools, fixing roads, and making communities safer.” Haaland <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMvaYT5uOTB/\">has noted</a> that she was covered under Medicaid when she gave birth to her child in the 1990s.</p> <p>For now, though, Smith says her family is continuing to navigate the financial insecurity of inflation, layoffs (Aibhie’s father works for <a href=\"https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/albuquerque-metro/students-staff-forced-to-leave-job-corps-centers-as-nationwide-cuts-hit-new-mexico/\">a labor department program facing federal cuts</a>) and Medicaid cuts. “We can’t even be at a savings point right now because we have to dip right back into it in order to survive week to week,” said Smith.</p> <p>Aibhie had been looking forward to starting college at New Mexico State University in the fall where she planned to pursue a degree as a veterinary technician. Her unresolved health issues made that future uncertain, but the possibility that she might lose health insurance coverage sealed the deal. Aibhie will live at home for another year and instead enroll in the local community college to take her general credits. “I know she’s disappointed,” said Smith.</p> <p>She fears that healthcare access for Americans is growing ever worse. “It’s very scary, I just shake my head, like, ‘God what are we going to do? Just live until we die?’”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pointless and witless, this atrociously acted ripoff of The Hills Have Eyes should be cast back into the water</p>",
    "content": "<p>There are horror movies that walk the viewer through their deepest fears, others that use the genre to explore broader social issues and anxieties, and others that are just about thrill rides and LOLs. And then there is silly, sadistic trash like this: a micro-budget ripoff of cannibal-killer franchise The Hills Have Eyes, its lousy sequels and suchlike. It even features an actor from the original 1977 Hills’ cast: Susan Lanier here plays Martha, a blowsy barmaid with a taste for human flesh. But Hills at least attempted to craft some sort of backstory for its mayhem; Martha and her skeezy friends’ tastes are just a given, as if encountering cannibals is just one of the hazards of the boating life, like sharks or equipment failure.</p> <p>The lambs to this slaughter are a quintet of mostly stupid young people in their 20s, who get together for partying purposes on the yacht of rich boy Chad (Zachary Roosa). Passengers include Chad’s permanently bikini-clad girlfriend Dana (Meghan Carrasquillo), stag buddy Franklin (Jamal R Averett), and lesbian couple Brandy (Amy Byrd) and Jess (Caitlin Rose). Yards of cocaine are snorted, gallons of booze consumed and makeouts embarked on as teasers for the film’s real idea of fun: putting the young’uns at the mercy of the tattooed boatyard body-eaters, who bring them ashore when the yacht runs out of gas at sea.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/856248876\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/856248876?app_id=122963&dnt=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the end, this isn’t anywhere near as gory as the Hills films at their worst, but there’s something much more dispiriting about The Boatyard’s pointlessness, its lack of wit, empathy, or basic film-making skill. The acting achieves such a finely tuned pitch of atrociousness it’s impossible to endure.</p> <p>• The Boatyard is on digital platforms from 22 September.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The freezer is one of the best tools for saving waste. Here it makes an unexpected but inspired burrata topper</p>",
    "content": "<p>While most Instagram food trends prioritise spectacle over substance, the viral frozen tomato idea that I’m employing today delivers genuine culinary value, and solves a common kitchen problem into the bargain. I’m a bit late to the party, admittedly, but it’s a versatile waste-saving technique.</p> <p>Its origin clearly derives from either Hawaiian shaved ice or granita, that classic Italian frozen dessert made by stirring and scraping or grating a sorbet-like base into shavings, and the approach essentially applies granita principles to fresh produce, while at the same time cutting out all of the hassle: simply pop any surplus or past-its-best fruit or vegetables in the freezer until they’re rock solid, then grate! </p> <h2>Frozen fruit and vegetable “granita” with burrata</h2> <p>The freezer is one of the best tools we have for saving waste, so if in doubt, freeze! I especially love the simplicity of this incredibly versatile dish, which can help save on waste by making use of various odds and ends or of wonky fruit and veg at the back of the crisper drawer by simply freezing it for later, then upcycling it into a really special starter. </p> <p>Burrata is the perfect vehicle for the subtlety of this shaved ice. It’s made by stretching a ball of mozzarella into a delicate pouch, and filling it with stracciatella (essentially, strands of mozzarella mixed with cream), and so creating one of the most delicious cheeses known to humankind.</p> <p>One fruit or vegetable is plenty for this, and will stand-alone if you want to create a simple dish, but if you have other ingredients that will work well, by all means go for it. I wanted a Neapolitan-style <em>tricolore</em> granita on my burrata, but ended with more of a Jamaican flag because I had only a green cucumber end, a red beef tomato and a yellow pepper spare. Other good seasonal combinations are beetroot, balsamic and dill, carrot; fennel, aleppo pepper and orange juice; and fig, balsamic and black pepper.</p> <p>This dish is hard to share so serve a whole burrata per person.</p> <p>Serves <strong>1</strong> </p> <p><strong>1 fruit or vegetable</strong> <br><strong>1 burrata<br>Sea salt</strong></p> <p>Optional extras (all to taste)<br><strong>Oil</strong>: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil or cold-pressed rapeseed oil<br><strong>Herbs and spices</strong>: basil, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, sumac, aleppo pepper<br><strong>Acid</strong>: orange or lemon juice, plus the finely grated zest, if the fruit’s organic and unwaxed (especially good with carrot and fennel); or aged balsamic vinegar (thicker balsamic sits better on the granita, rather than melting it).</p> <p>Take your chosen fruit or vegetable and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight, until solid. </p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <p>When you’re ready to serve, place the burrata on a plate and grate your chosen frozen ingredient directly over the top. Season generously with sea salt, then drizzle with the oil of your choice. Add a sprinkle of herbs or spices and, if you like, a touch of acidity, then serve immediately because the frozen shavings melt <em>very </em>quickly.</p>",

    "title": "It’s ‘game on’ for launch, says rugby’s breakaway R360 league – but how ready is it really? | Matt Hughes",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/rugby-union-breakaway-r360-rfu-england",
    "description": "<p>Co-founder Mike Tindall insists R360 will launch next year but, with financial projections changing, questions remain</p>",
    "content": "<p>R360’s decision to withdraw its application for sanctioning by World Rugby this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/breakaway-r360-league-launch-blow-world-rugby-application-withdrawn-rugby-union\">as revealed by the Guardian</a>, was the first significant setback for the planned breakaway league, which had appeared to be developing unstoppable momentum.</p> <p>More than 160 players have signed pre-contract agreements with the proposed new competition, which is offering annual salaries of up to £740,000 for a 16-match season, with 75% of the potential recruits having played international rugby within the past two years, and at least 10 of them for England.</p> <p>Despite this, R360 decided to defer its application for sanctioning after it became clear it would be unable to answer all the governing body’s questions before the World Rugby council meeting in Dublin on 23 September. In response, the co-founder Mike Tindall released a video in which he claimed it is “very much game on” for the new competition to launch in October next year.</p> <p>However, gaining World Rugby approval at its next council meeting in June will be just the start for R360, which is under the microscope about whether the proposition stacks up financially. About 40 leading internationals have been promised the top £740,000 salary, including some from other codes such as the rugby league stars Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Ryan Papenhuyzen, offers that will incur huge start-up costs and require immediate and significant revenue generation.</p> <p>R360 has secured seed-funding from the Switzerland-based investment company Albachiara Group, but will require further investment moving forward. An R360 sales deck sent to potential investors, obtained by the Guardian, provides some insight into the extent of the project’s ambition and the likely business plan. When contacted by the Guardian, R360 sources described the deck as an early document and said the financial projections have changed, although it still provides a fascinating insight into its methodology.</p>    <p>In its sales pitch R360 forecasts revenues of £275m in its first year based on current dollar-sterling exchange rates, rising to turnover of £540m after five years, a projected income stream that seasoned sports investors have dismissed as outlandish.</p> <p>“It’s crazy to think they can do this,” one investor says. “In the last 25 years the only start-up competitions that have generated more than £100m a year are the Indian Premier League, Sail GP and Formula E. It’s not going to happen.”</p> <p>According to the deck, R360’s projections are based on bringing in about £180m in ticket sales in its first season, which will require a combination of large crowds and high prices, both optimistic for a start-up. A senior executive at Twickenham questioned whether R360 can sell the tens of thousands of tickets required at premium prices, and offered a cautionary tale.</p> <p>“We have the best players in the world at Twickenham every summer playing for the Barbarians against international opposition, and struggle to sell tickets,” the executive said. “It’s not just about star players. Fans want to watch games that have real meaning, history and rivalries, not just big names running around. I really think R360 are underestimating the size of the challenge.”</p>    <p>R360 does not appear to be underestimating its future income streams to investors, even if the deck was essentially a sales pitch.</p> <p>Revenue of £35m and £31m respectively is forecast from hosting fees from venues and media rights, with the latter figure seemingly dependent on securing advertising revenue, as R360’s broadcast strategy appears to be streaming matches for free on YouTube. R360 sources would not comment on potential media partners, but said the underlying ethos of the project was to make the competition available free-to-air to attract as many eyeballs as possible.</p> <p>R360 is also banking on major cash injections in the form of franchise fees. The original pitch said the tender process under way will yield £60m this year in down payments from the 12 franchises, followed by further fees of £25m in 2026 and 2027, £55m in 2028, and £40m in 2029 and 2030.</p> <p>The tender is due to completed by the end of this month, with bidders asked to pay about £25m for one of the eight men’s franchises, and up to £10m for one of the four women’s teams. Both competitions will ultimately expand to take in more franchises, but matches will remain capped at a maximum of 16 each season to ease player workload, significantly less than the limit of 30 club games-per-season agreed by the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby.</p> <p>Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, and the Glazer family are among those reported as being interested in buying franchises. The Guardian has learned that Red Bull was offered the opportunity to buy a franchise, but dismissed the opportunity to focus on buying Newcastle Falcons.</p> <p>R360 was initially predicting profits of almost £10m in its first year, rising to £32m by 2030. R360 sources said this week that it was now aiming to be profitable by its third year, which would still be a significant achievement.</p> <p>The size of the challenge facing R360 is perhaps best shown by the fate of other new competitions. Even the commercial juggernaut that is the IPL, which entered an empty global market for franchise competitions in 2008 with the unique advantage of selling to India’s 1.45 billion cricket-loving population, made a profit of only £4.21m in its first year in 2008 on revenues of £54m.</p> <p>Other start-ups have fared less well, most notably LIV Golf, which still appears to be losing cash four years after launch. In its most recently published accounts, for 2023 – the third year of operations, which R360 is targeting for profitability – LIV recorded losses of £291m.</p>    <p>As a challenger event whose business plan is based on poaching global stars from long-established competitions, the comparison with LIV appears salient for R360, particularly given its difficulties in the broadcast market. LIV’s 2023 financial results reveal broadcast rights income of only £2.2m for its third season, a fraction of the £31m R360 was originally forecasting in its first year, while it will not have the vast resources of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund as protection from commercial realities.</p> <p>Such is R360’s determination it has even expressed confidence of being able to launch next year without World Rugby sanctioning, which although theoretically possible would make life difficult. It is unclear whether proposed venues would sign contracts in defiance of the governing body, while recruiting players may also be far more complex.</p> <p>The pre-contract agreements signed to date are essentially expressions of interest, giving players the option to withdraw at any point, while R360 will also need approval from individual unions to launch. While some of the smaller nations may grant their blessing, there is little chance of the RFU doing so, as it is just about to enter the second season of the eight-year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/04/borthwick-amasses-great-power-but-fresh-responsibility-may-weigh-heavy\">professional game partnership</a> governing player release with Premiership Rugby, which would be decimated by the new competition.</p> <p>With so many hurdles to overcome the prospect of R360 launching next September as planned feels remote, although further delays may not be the end of the world for those involved, with the executive team of 10 already drawing salaries.</p> <p>An index to the initial sales deck shows a budget of £1.3m has been allocated to executive pay and recruitment. If sufficient investors buy in, the R360 project could prove lucrative for some, even if a ball is never kicked.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Yulia Navalnaya says tests by two laboratories on samples smuggled out of Russia show her husband was killed by poison</p>",
    "content": "<p>Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said that two foreign laboratories had confirmed her husband was poisoned, after tests on biological samples secretly smuggled out of Russia.</p> <p>Navalny, 47, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/17/alexei-navalny-death-confirmed-official-cause-of-death-disputed\">died</a> suddenly on 16 February 2024, while being held in a jail about 40 miles (64km) north of the Arctic Circle, where he had been sentenced to decades in prison to be served in a “special regime”.</p> <p>Navalny’s allies have accused the Kremlin repeatedly of killing him – allegations Moscow has dismissed as absurd. Russian officials insist he died of a mixture of diseases, including heart arrhythmia triggered by hypertension.</p> <p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday he was unaware of Navalnaya’s claims.</p> <p>Navalnaya, who lives abroad, posted a video on X in which she said biological material from Navalny was smuggled abroad in 2024 and then examined by two laboratories.</p> <p>“These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,” Navalnaya said, urging the two laboratories to release the findings.</p> <p>“These results are of public importance and must be published. We all deserve to know the truth,” she said.</p> <p>Navalnaya also said the surveillance footage from the final day of her husband’s life had vanished, despite the opposition leader being under near-constant camera monitoring throughout his imprisonment.</p> <p>She did not specify what poison the laboratories had found.</p> <p>Navalny’s allies also released previously unseen photographs they said were taken inside the prison cell after his death. The images show a cramped cell with what appears to be vomit and blood on the floor, next to a notebook and an Oxford dictionary.</p> <p>Leonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny, wrote on X that the opposition leader had been “murdered in an agonising way, with poison”.</p> <p>He added: “No matter how much they tried to erase details from the medical records or cover their tracks, we know everything about his final day and the method of his killing.”</p> <p>The regional penitentiary service said in a statement at the time of his death that Navalny “felt unwell after a walk and almost immediately lost consciousness”.</p> <p>Last year, the investigative outlet the Insider also raised the possibility that Navalny had been poisoned, citing medical records that appeared to have been altered to support the state’s claim that he died of cardiac problems.</p> <p>The Insider published what it said was the original report, which stated that on 16 February Navalny “complained of severe abdominal pain, began vomiting, suffered convulsions and lost consciousness” – details, the Insider said, that suggested possible poisoning.</p> <p>A second version of the report, which appeared to have been edited, omitted those symptoms.</p> <p>The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.</p> <p>In 2020, Navalny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/20/alexei-navalny-russian-opposition-figure-unconscious-in-hospital-says-aide\">fell into a coma</a> after a suspected poisoning using novichok by Russia’s FSB security service and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/21/alexei-navalny-to-be-flown-to-germany-for-suspected-poisoning-treatment\">evacuated to Germany for treatment</a>.</p> <p>He recovered and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/alexei-navalny-detained-at-airport-on-return-to-russia\">returned to Russia in January 2021</a>, where he was arrested on a parole violation charge and received the first of several jail sentences that would have amounted to more than 30 years behind bars.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The most senior liberal justice on the US supreme court has questioned whether American citizens know the difference between presidents and kings.</p> <p>During a conference on civics education in New York on Tuesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the poor quality of civics education means Americans may not be entirely clear on what makes a president different to a monarch.</p> <p>“Do we understand what the difference is between a king and a president?” Sotomayor asked at the forum hosted by New York Law School. “And I think if people understood these things from the beginning, they would be more informed as to what would be important in a democracy.”</p> <p>Sotomayor, 71, identified a lack of education around issues as the rule of law, saying not enough people have a basic understanding of the power of the US president and the limits imposed on executive branch authority by the US constitution.</p> <p>Sotomayor has been a dissenting opinion in many recent supreme court rulings, including the reduction of federal agencies and the termination of officials that are theoretically protected from political influence by Congress.</p> <p>Sotomayor also issued a dissenting opinion when the court ruled last year that Trump had immunity from prosecution for his part in attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.</p> <p>“In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law,” Sotomayor wrote in opposition to the ruling.</p> <p>In her comments on Tuesday, Sotomayor did not address the contentious political moment that is playing out, critics say, with the executive branch exerting power over a Republican-led Congress.</p> <p>Recent reports suggest that classroom civics education has become a minefield of educators.</p> <p>Trump issued two executive orders in January – one titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling”, aimed to restrict certain teachings, and “Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families” focused on school choice.</p> <p>NBC News reported Sotomayor’s comments stressing that school children to be educated about government, and she referenced polling suggesting that few young people support democracy.</p> <p>Without that, “what’s left?” she asked.</p> <p>Surveys have found that some teachers say they now avoid certain controversial topics but are conversely doing more to do more on civics instruction,<a href=\"https://civxnow.org/states/state-policy-scan/\"> according to a tracker </a>maintained by CivxNow, the advocacy arm of iCivics, an organization that aims to advance civic learning.</p> <p>Since 2021, 24 states have passed legislation that would add civics course to high school graduation requirements or devoted additional funding to the subject.</p> <p>Sotomayor also weighed in on the vivid free US speech debate and the roots of political violence on the same day that US attorney general Pam Bondi clarified remarks made on a podcast that hate speech could be prosecuted under the law as incitement to violence.</p> <p>“There’s free speech and then there’s hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society,” Bondi said in a episode of The Katie Miller podcast, referring to the killing of rightwinger Charlie Kirk.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/agpambondi/status/1967913066554630181?s=46\">In a post on lengthy post on X</a> Tuesday, Bondi clarified her thing, writing: “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime.”</p> <p>But Sotomayor countered: “Every time I listen to a lawyer-trained representative saying we should criminalize free speech in some way, I think to myself that law school failed.”</p>",

    "content": "<h2>More repressive legislation against Jews: swastika to be national flag</h2> <p>From our own correspondent<br>16 September 1935</p> <p><em>Berlin</em><br>Herr Hitler’s eagerly awaited speech to the first Reichstag to meet in the city of Nuremberg for 440 years was one of the briefest he has ever made, lasting hardly 10 minutes. After almost every sentence there were either roars of approbation or indignant cries of shame from the Nazi deputies. Two points were of great importance in the speech, the one dealing with foreign affairs and the other with domestic, and both had been anticipated by observers here. A warning was given to the signatories of the Memel statute, and a threat was made to Lithuania herself. The robbery of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Memel-dispute#ref183692\">Memel</a> had, be said, been legalised by the League. For years the Germans of Memel had been mishandled by the Lithuanian state, their only crime being that they were Germans.</p> <p>The second and domestic major point was in regard to the previously uttered dictum that “The Nazi party commands the state, and not the state the party.” This dictum is to be implemented and given legal form. It was also announced that the swastika is to be the national flag, in place of the black, white, and red flag.</p> <p><strong>“Jewish problem”<br></strong>Upon the Jewish question Herr Hitler’s declaration showed an intransigence which will probably be regarded as a mandate for the extremists and Jew-baiters like Herr <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/julius-streicher-biography\">Streicher</a>, who has sat at Herr Hitler’s right had during the party congress.</p> <p>Herr Hitler spoke of alleged internal and international provocation by Jewry. He referred to the alleged provocation of the Jews during the showing of a Swedish film during the summer in Berlin, which was followed by the anti-Jewish riots in Kurfürstendamm, hinting clearly of a world Jewish plot. Herr Hitler suggested that these events at home and abroad had the appearance of being systematically planned.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Click to view.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theguardian.newspapers.com/article/the-guardian/181161757/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;display:block;&quot; target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?clippingId=181161757&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;height=603&amp;amp;ts=1607535806&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;font: 13px helvetica, sans-serif; color: #747474;padding: 4px 0;max-width: 700px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Guardian, 16 September 1935.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The new German ‘Blood and Honour’ law</h2> <p>From our own correspondent<br>17 September 1935</p> <p><em>Berlin</em><br>Although the law passed by the Reichstag last night dealing with German citizenship was forecast months ago, and though also the law forbidding marriage or intimate relations between Jews and “Aryans” – the law for “the protection of German blood and honour” – has been expected, their proclamation in this sudden way has come as a surprise.</p> <p>The citizenship law was promised by Dr <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Frick\">Frick</a>, minister of the interior, in a public statement in April. It corresponds, of course, to the principles laid down in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/first-mein-kampf-reprint-germany-since-war-sixth-print-run-hitler\">My Struggle</a>, Herr Hitler’s gospel of National Socialism, which divides those living within Germany’s borders into citizens, state subjects, and foreigners, with full civic rights for citizens only. It differs in its present form from the outline given by Dr Frick in at least one striking particular, for he said that an oath of allegiance to Herr Hitler would be one of the conditions of German citizenship, and this is not in the law.</p> <p><strong>The law explained</strong><br>The German semi-official news agency points out to-day that only people of completely Jewish blood, and not “non-Aryans”, or persons with some Jewish blood, are reckoned as Jews under the new statute. The agency, in a commentary, compares the status of the Jews in Germany to that of a national minority. The “blood and honour law”, it is claimed, shows that the German people do not object to the Jews so long as they intend to keep to their own race and to act accordingly.</p> <p>Germans, however, refuse to regard the Jews as fellow-citizens and to give them the same rights and duties as Germans. The Zionist Conference in Switzerland, it is added, has confirmed the belief that the Jewish question is not one of religion but of race. Germany has drawn the obvious conclusions and has complied with the claims of the Zionist Conference by making the Jews a national minority.</p> <p>The writer of this commentary has overlooked the great differences between the status of the Jews in Germany and that of a national minority at least in any European country. Many minorities have their rights guaranteed by international treaties, even if the guarantees are not fully effective, and have also the right of appeal to an international body against discrimination and ill-treatment.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/17/The_Guardian,_17_Sept_1935.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p> <h2>Persecution in Germany: Manchester protest demonstration</h2> <p>16 September 1935</p> <p>One of the most remarkable meetings held in Manchester within recent years took place at the Free Trade Hall, last night, when 3,000 people attended a demonstration against the Nazi persecution in Germany. Every part of the hall was crowded.</p> <p><strong>Death for free speech</strong> <br>Mr GHC Bing, a barrister, who attended the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2311.1935.tb01306.x\">Penal Reform Congress</a> in Berlin, described the German penal system. When he read out a section which stated that anyone who made political speeches could be hanged as an agitator, a murmur rose from the vast crowd. Their duty, be said, was not so much to condemn the guilty as to find some practical means of saving those who yet lived.</p> <p>He wanted to urge upon them the great value of protesting. There was no doubt that a protest was of immense value in Germany. They were afraid of such protests as had been made in the foreign press. He must, he felt, pay tribute here to the Manchester Guardian. (Applause.) He thought that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2015/apr/08/manchester-guardian-germany-war-hitler-archive-1933\">Manchester Guardian</a>, and in a less degree other papers, had done an immense amount in saving the victims of German fascism. The fight in which they were engaged was the fight for civilisation. Fascism was indivisible and the fascism they were fighting in Europe was the same fascism as was a power in other countries of Europe. In this country people were often separated by bitter political feelings, but it was generally possible to find some bridge. “Between us and fascism,” concluded Mr Bing, “a chasm is fixed over which no bridge is possible. If we arc to defeat fascism we must defeat it together. There is no other way.”</p> <h2>German Jews refused marriage licences</h2> <p>17 September 1935</p> <p>In consequence of the new German marriage laws the Dutch municipal authorities have already refused to license the marriages of several German Jews with German or Dutch women. Such marriages are no longer legal in Germany, and under existing treaty arrangements between Holland and Germany, German and Dutch subjects are bound by the laws of their own country, whichever side of the frontier they live.</p> <h2>Editorial: Hitler marks time</h2> <p>17 September 1935</p> <p>Those who believe that Germany is returning to “decent reaction” and that Conservative or Moderate forces will, with the help of the Reichswehr, triumph over “Nazi radicalism” will have found little comfort in Hitler’s speech in the Reichstag on Sunday night.</p> <p>The new legislation announced by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Goring\">General Göring</a>, after Hitler had made what is probably the shortest public speech in his career, gives legal effect to what is in effect becoming the reality. The German Jews are now, as in the middle ages, being confined to the ghetto. That in itself would be a relatively humane solution of the “Jewish problem.” What is happening to the German Jews, and is now being legalised, is that they are being put into a permanent quarantine. They are treated as a source of moral and physical contamination and are being at the same time segregated and slowly exterminated. Hitler’s ferocious verbal attack on the Jews – such attacks are frequently the prelude to new waves of physical persecution and are intended to be such – was accompanied by the usual abuse of Soviet Russia. Hitler’s ideas, like those of all Nazis, are not in the least new. They can only be made to seem new because they are so out of date that there has been ample time for them to have been forgotten.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/17/The_Guardian,_Nuremberg_leader,_17_Sept_1935.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p>    <h2>Nazi concentration camps not improved</h2> <p>From our special correspondent<br>20 September 1935</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/dachau-concentration-camp-established-nazis-1933\">Dachau</a> was one of the worst of the German concentration camps, but neither there nor in any others, except one or two that came to be used as “show places,” has there been any improvement in the lot of the prisoners. All the publicity and protest in the outside world has made no difference whatever.</p> <p>Some of the prisoners have been in Dachau for two and a half years. The hope that their internment was merely provisional and would come to an end as soon as things had “settled down” in Germany has been abandoned. To their often unendurable physical torments is added the despairing conviction that there will never be any help from abroad and that there will be no release as long as the Third Realm lasts.</p> <p>The prisoners number about 1,600. They are made up of Communists, Social Democrats, “oppositional” SA men (that is to say, Brownshirts who turned against Hitler, especially after 30 June last year), tramps, and ordinary criminals, of whom some are used as informers amongst the political prisoners. The Jews include 30 who returned to Germany this year, thinking it to be safe, and were sent to Dachau.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/17/The_Guardian,_20_September_1935.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p> <h2>Editorial: German Christians and Jews</h2> <p>21 September 1935</p> <p>One of the minor products of the new German nationalism is the sect known as the “German Christians”; while unimportant in themselves, they have received an artificial importance because they are being used by the Nazi dictatorship to break up the Protestant churches in the hope that the pieces could be reunited in one national Church that would propagate National Socialism while pretending to propagate Christianity. The “German Christians” are particularly truculent and bigoted sectarians and have been rejected by innumerable congregations all over Germany. In fact, they are only able to survive because they have the help of the secular arm and, more especially, of the secret State police. They have now come into prominence again by taking a particularly odious part in the renewed persecution of the Jews.<br><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/17/Guardian_leader,_21_Sept_1935.jpg\">Continue reading.</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/25/nuremberg-laws-patton-national-archives\">Nuremberg laws that General Patton stole given to US National Archives</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The Jews in Germany: Hitler interpreted</h2> <p>From our own correspondent<br>21 September 1935</p> <p>Some light is thrown upon what Herr Hitler meant on Sunday when he declared to the Reichstag at Nuremberg that if the German blood and honour law for the settlement of the Jewish question failed the solution of the problem would devolve upon the Nazi party, by General Göring’s organ the National Zeitung in an article entitled, A Resolution in the Philosophy of the State.</p> <p>In his statement Herr Hitler said, “This law is an attempt to settle by law a problem which, if legal methods should fail, will be left to the party for a definite solution,” and this is interpreted as authority for putting into practice the Nazi maxim that the party commands the State and not the State the party. The present opposition from the civil service to the party’s will may have to be brought to an end, it is stated, through direct action by the party itself.</p> <p><strong>Party or state<br></strong>While previously legislation, the execution of legislation, and the supervision of its execution, has been in the hands of organs of the state (the article states), there may be an occasion when the continuation of the fight against the power that had been held by the Jews and against the attempts of the jews to get the new influence in Germany, can no longer be carried out by the state, but will have to be taken over by the organisation which forced its political will upon the state when power was assumed by Adolf Hitler. In this case the Jewish people would have to be prepared for the Nazi party’s taking things into its hands within the framework of the party organisation. The fight against Jews the would then be taken up and carried out by the regional, district, and local organisations of the party. The measures the party would take would be of a legal character, and the state would have to assist through its official organs.</p> <p>The article then points out that it has been remarked that there is a “certain reticence” on the part of a section of the civil service to certain of the aims of the party, which has caused its leaders anxiety from time to time. Perhaps, therefore, one fine day the state machinery which was not working sufficiently rapidly and intensely might be steered by the party with a speed and direction which would liven it. Perhaps, too, the civil service might be excluded altogether from the solution of some problems, and the party might directly carry out its political will on them.</p> <p>This course, it is stated, is not desired, but the party cannot tolerate opposition to its will from civil servants, high or low.</p>",

The 62-year-old was in charge of Benfica between September and December 2000 and would face a swift return to Chelsea in the Champions League on 30 September.</p> <p>Benfica’s president, Rui Costa, confirmed Lage had been dismissed in a press conference after Tuesday night’s Champions League home defeat by Qarabag of Azerbaijan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/16/champions-league-roundup-juventus-dortmund-4-4-qarabag-union-saint-gilloise-benfica-psv\">who came from 2-0 behind</a> at the Estádio da Luz. “I believe this is the time for a change, precisely to avoid compromising the season,” Costa said. “And, consequently, the coach who comes in must be a winning coach.

    "description": "<p>The all-girl trio gave punk a playful spin and drew admirers in Paul Weller and Captain Sensible – but, singer Debsey Wykes recalls, faced confusion for being out of step with era’s noise and anger</p>",
    "content": "<p>At 19 years old, Debsey Wykes stood in front of a sold-out crowd at London’s Hammersmith Odeon, her knees “literally knocking with fear”, as she puts it. It was the end of 1980 and Dolly Mixture were supporting the Jam for a second time, having piqued the interest of Paul Weller. Despite the shaky start, the teen trio made it through the set to appreciative applause. “Everyone is your friend when you support the Jam,” Wykes recalls in her new memoir, Teenage Daydream: We Are the Girls Who Play in a Band.</p> <p>Dolly Mixture paired girl-group harmonies and pop sensibilities with scuffed-up combat boots and charity shop dresses. Their intricate arrangements remained playfully punk, displaying a songwriting craft well beyond their years. Although beloved by the Undertones and John Peel, as well as becoming the first group to release a single on Weller’s label, Respond, the band never found the success of many of their peers. “I think people were confused,” says Wykes. “One: we were girls, and girls often didn’t play in bands. And if you’re not dressed in jeans and leather, you must be crap and cute. There was no subtlety allowed.”</p> <p>Dolly Mixture had arrived on the scene a few years ahead of the jangling indie wave, and right before bands such as Shop Assistants and the Pastels would bring precious pop back into vogue. In 1980, the band didn’t quite fit in with the cynicism and aggression of post-punk. “We had this pop mindset; we wanted to be on Top of the Pops,” Wykes says. “It was just an antidote to grey – and punk, which was getting boring.”</p>    <p>Bonded by a shared obsession with punk, 60s pop, and Eddie and the Hot Rods, Cambridge school friends Rachel Bor (guitar), Hester Smith (drums) and Wykes (bass) formed Dolly Mixture in 1978. They eschewed labels like punks, skins or mods to create their own tribe, naming them and their fans “Dolly Rockers”. “We were trying to be unique,” says Wykes.</p> <p>The band quickly gained local support. They had only been together about a year when they were asked to open for the Fall in Cambridge. A friend named Dave Goodman (producer and live engineer for the Sex Pistols) had offered to tune their guitars ahead of their set. “We went on and we just heard this awful noise and we didn’t know what it was,” Wykes says. “By the third song we realised it was us.” It turned out Goodman had tuned the guitars “pissed out of his head”, says Wykes. “The lower strings were higher than the highest strings, it was completely mental.”</p> <p>They also earned the respect of peers: luckily, Robyn Hitchcock, who had recently become a fan and friend, seized their instruments and quickly got them back in order. The band never let anyone tune their guitars again.</p> <p>The trio began splitting their time between Cambridge and London, playing as much as they could. It was at a London gig that they met Eric Faulkner, former guitarist for their tween idols the Bay City Rollers. Faulkner had liked their show and offered on the spot to produce a single. Several weeks later they were staying overnight at his glamorous apartment at the top of Kings Road, rehearsing for the next day’s studio sessions.</p> <p>Faulkner graciously woke the girls up each morning with tea and toast. “That was probably all he could make,” says Wykes. At the end of the day’s rehearsal, Faulkner gave the girls some cash and told them to go down to the supermarket. They returned with groceries, cooked some sausages and watched Eurovision together. “It was really bizarre – nice guy!” says Wykes.</p> <p>And a backstage encounter with the Undertones led them to invite Dolly Mixture to play with them in a nearby town. A week later, Wykes was at home playing piano when her mother announced: “There’s an Undertone on the phone for you.” It was guitarist John O’Neill, calling to ask if the band could join them on the remainder of their tour dates. They were elated and quickly said yes.</p> <p>Undertones fans were rowdier – and spittier – than any that Dolly Mixture had previously encountered. It was even worse when the band joined Bad Manners for a month-long tour a year later, when their shows were drawing some far-right fans. “We came across so many National Front people and they really hated us,” Wykes says. “They were sieg heiling and spitting and trying to get us off the stage. And we would not get off the stage.”</p>    <p>The band remained determined. “We found it quite an interesting challenge, to not get off, and to annoy them. Which we certainly did.” Plus they knew they had backup if anyone tried anything. “There was always someone backstage who would quite happily lump somebody – a fucking massive skinhead in the wings just waiting for the chance.”</p> <p>Wykes estimates the band played about 190 gigs in 1981 alone. It was a last minute drop-out by the Nips that landed Dolly Mixture their first show with the Jam. A mutual friend had advocated for the band despite Weller’s apparent disdain for their 60s girl group sound. But the trio won him over that night; they had entered the Jam’s orbit and soon began discussing recording some songs for Weller’s newly minted Respond Records. But despite two singles on the label – produced by their new friend Captain Sensible – a proper record deal never materialised. Wykes says when major labels expressed interest in the band, it was always followed by a sexist insistence that other musicians record the music for them. Dolly Mixture always refused. Or, says Wykes, they would say “they already had a ‘female’ on their books”.</p> <p>In 1982, another collaboration with Captain Sensible took a surprising turn. Happy Talk, Sensible’s first solo single, crashed the Top 100, and all of a sudden the band found themselves on Top of the Pops after all – as his backup singers when the song hit No 1. “It was very odd to step in through the door and have a little look around, get a few free drinks and be treated like <em>you’re</em> No 1,” Wykes says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/02/soft-sandwiches-street-fights-and-surrealism-marlene-marders-memoir-of-swiss-punks-kleenexliliput\">Soft sandwiches, street fights and surrealism: Marlene Marder’s memoir of Swiss punks Kleenex/Liliput</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While doing TV appearances and music videos for Sensible’s album, Dolly Mixture had plateaued, playing the same kinds of shows as ever without any label backing them. Frustrated, they decided to release an album themselves. The result was Demonstration Tapes, a two-disc LP of brilliant demo recordings limited to 2,000 copies. The band packaged the records themselves and signed them in pink pen. Today, copies are sought-after collector’s items.</p> <p>In 1984 Bor and Sensible announced that they were having a child, and Dolly Mixture started to wind down. Wykes continues to play music, including a longstanding role as a live member of Saint Etienne. In the interim, Dolly Mixture found fans in K Records founder Calvin Johnson, as well as younger bands such as Alvvays and Tchotchke. Demonstration Tapes has been repressed a number of times, and a rarities LP released in 2019 quickly sold out.</p> <p>Wykes’s book now adds a few more details to the band’s growing place in punk history. “I wrote this because I wanted to feel better about the whole thing, and put us on the map,” she says. “If I’ve done a little towards that, then it’s a really great thing.”</p> <p>• Teenage Daydream: We are the Girls Who Play in a Band is published by New Modern on 25 September</p>",

    "content": "<p>A former CIA officer stripped of his security clearance by the Trump administration has announced he’s running for Senate as a Democratic candidate to claim Mitch McConnell’s long-held Kentucky seat.</p> <p>Joel Willett launched his candidacy Wednesday, weeks after director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked his clearance as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/20/trump-revokes-security-clearances-gabbard\">purge</a> targeting 37 current and former intelligence officials.</p> <p>“I’ve seen firsthand how the Trump administration and their far-right allies are trying to weaponize the government against anyone who disagrees with them,” Willett said in his announcement. “That just made me more determined to run.”</p> <p>Following the revocation, Willett faced attacks from Trump-aligned online activists such as Laura Loomer and received death threats, according to his campaign. Gabbard at the time accused those targeted of “politicizing and manipulating intelligence” but provided no supporting evidence for the claims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/kash-patel-fbi-senate-hearing\">Kash Patel denies politicizing FBI in fiery grilling by Democratic senators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for Willett, the experience has crystallized his concerns about democratic institutions and the treatment of public servants who express dissenting views.</p> <p>“It’s not lost on me that this happened exactly two weeks after my name surfaced as a potential candidate,” Willett said in an early September interview with the Guardian, calling the revocations “a nakedly political act that is intended to silence dissent”.</p> <p>Willett said it’s the Trump administration that’s politicizing intelligence agencies, which “is erasing over 100 years of progress on professionalizing our civil service”.</p> <p>“At the current rate we’re going, the country that I swore an oath to will be unrecognizable in five to 10 years,” he said.</p> <p>The 41-year-old served at the White House situation room after stints with the army, FBI and CIA before leaving government in 2015. He has since worked in the private sector while occasionally criticizing Trump’s approach to intelligence agencies, including signing a letter in 2019 calling for Trump’s impeachment.</p> <p>Like other millennial upstarts on the Democratic roster seeking their state’s senate seat, including Maine’s Graham Platner and Texas’ James Talarico, Willett’s early messaging hones in on economic inequality. In his campaign launch, he criticized budget legislation that will “transfer $4tn out of much needed government services [and] put it in the pockets of billionaires”.</p> <p>But he also has his eye on fentanyl addiction, as both his parents battled with the drug and his father died of an overdose in 2019. “Fentanyl didn’t care that I worked at the White House,” he said. “It affects all families, truly without fear or favor.”</p> <p>Willett enters what is sure to be a closely watched race for a seat being vacated by McConnell, who held it for over 40 years, in a state that has voted for Republicans for the senate for the last few decades. But Kentucky in recent years has been friendly to less-ideologically focused lawmakers: voters in the state twice elected Andy Beshear, a Democratic governor, during the Trump era, as well as Republicans Thomas Massie, who is facing the president’s wrath in his coming re-election bid, and occasional Trump critic senator Rand Paul.</p>",

    "content": "<p>At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/04/thursday-briefing-china-flexes-its-muscle-in-the-tussle-for-global-dominance\">high-profile global summit</a> held by China this month, there were strong statements directed at the west’s “bullying” as well as renewed calls to stabilise “global governance”. The meeting was the clearest indication yet that China is vying to become a world superpower, aiming to marshal an anti-western bloc. But the foundations of that position partly lie in Africa and the Caribbean, where China has been building relationships for decades.</p> <h2><strong>A stable partner or a trap?</strong></h2>    <p>It’s always odd to me to read about China as “rising” on the global stage. It seems a particularly western-centric view of a country that, as far as many Africans are concerned, had risen a long time ago. China’s cultural outreach was a feature of life in 1980s Sudan, where Chinese entertainment was broadcast on the only national TV channel. (I have a childhood recollection of a mesmeric dragon dance that never lost its dazzle, even though it was rebroadcast for years.)</p> <p>Political delegation trips from China were commonplace. They included school visits and performances at an iconic building named <a href=\"https://www.modern-sudan.com/friendship-hall\">Friendship Hall,</a> a modernist event space on the banks of the River Nile. The venue, built by the Sudanese government in the early 1970s with financial assistance from China, launched the countries’ “friendship”. Its design was led by the then Shanghai Institute of Civic Architecture and it was built with the help of hundreds of Chinese workers.</p> <p>In hindsight, much of this outreach was political strategy. It was in the midst of the cold war, and China was forging anti-western links and colonial solidarity with newly independent countries. In a huge ramp up of its ambitions, China’s economy liberalised in the 1990s and its investment in Africa and the Caribbean exploded.</p> <p>During that decade, trade between Africa and China <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2014/09/26/the-new-neo-colonialism-in-africa/#:~:text=Trade%20between%20China%20and%20the,well%20due%20to%20these%20policies.\">grew by a massive 700%</a>, making it the continent’s largest single trading partner. In the decade after, the 2000s, China became one of the largest trading partners for several Caribbean countries, having been an early aid supporter for Guyana in the 1970s. By the 2010s, trade with China and Caribbean countries <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/the-caribbean-and-u-s-china-strategic-competition-next-phase-of-the-new-cold-war/#:~:text=China's%20economic%20statecraft%20in%20the,Suriname%20and%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago.\">went from negligible to almost</a> $10 bn annually.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A glut of Chinese goods</strong></p>    <p>What that looked like on the ground across Africa and the Caribbean was a vast complex of Chinese investment: roads and infrastructure, healthcare facilities, residential compounds, and a glut of Chinese goods. It has long been the norm that Chinese consumer products, particularly domestic, are the default for many of these economies.</p> <p>I am particularly struck by the mass adoption of Chinese mobile phones in many African countries, where it is rare to find a Samsung or an iPhone outside the ranks of the upper middle classes. Three Chinese phonemakers – Tecno, Infinix and itel – are made only for sale in Africa, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-16/africa-s-shift-to-smartphones-is-creating-a-new-chinese-phone-giant\">make up half of phone purchases</a> there. Affordable and tailored to the African market (eg with the functionality to use multiple sim cards as users switch between different providers for cheaper bundles), these phones are symbolic of how the Chinese market adapts to target the region.</p> <p>In some instances, China is settling into the very infrastructure. Over the past decade, it has provided <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qk9p2elo\">free satellite dishes</a> to thousands of homes in sub-Saharan Africa and, in a throwback to those days of cultural projection, included Chinese content dubbed in local languages in TV subscription packages. The very electricity powering those TVs is also, increasingly, China sourced.</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/climate/africa-china-solar-panels.html\">Chinese solar panels have taken off in Africa</a>, bought by people tired of expensive and unreliable grid electricity. The result is that <a href=\"https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2025/07/chinas-off-grid-solar-home-systems-light-up-lives-in-sub-saharan-africa/\">even in remote</a> and rural areas, solar panels sit on top of modest homes and shops, and in one instance I saw on the Kenyan coast, a braider’s kiosk.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Unmatched domestic influence</strong></p>    <p>But it is in construction where China has really established itself as not just a trading country but a domestic partner. In Khartoum, Sudan, a boom in residential housing in the 00s drew in such a large number of Chinese construction workers that a dedicated housing complex on the outskirts of the city was built. In Nairobi, a gigantic <a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/a-view-shows-the-nairobi-cityscape-on-the-nairobi-expressway-undertaken-by-the-china-road-and-bridge-corporation-along-waiyaki-way-within-westlands-district-of-nairobi/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjI6bmV3c21sX1JDMlgyVTlEMFRDTw==?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&amp;utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead\">highway completed four years ago</a> and built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation transformed the Kenyan capital overnight, reducing snarling traffic. A similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/24/beijing-highway-600m-road-just-the-start-of-chinas-investments-in-caribbean\">highway project was built</a> in Jamaica, connecting the north and south. China even built the headquarters of the African Union in Ethiopia. Chances are, in many locations in these regions, if there was a construction project, there were Chinese workers and supervisors in their helmets and hi-vis jackets at the helm.</p> <p><br>China’s belt and road initiative, which funds and executes such projects, sprawls across these two regions. The country is involved in everything <a href=\"https://embassy.ag/dario-item-antigua-barbuda-steady-progress-at-booby-alley-housing-project-as-government-of-chinas-grant-transforms-pointe-community/\">from affordable housing</a> units in Antigua and Barbuda <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/addis-ababa-china-construction-style\">to luxury apartments</a> in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. So ubiquitous is China that many of these new skylines are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/african-cities-now-look-like-chinese-cities-2015-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">beginning to resemble those of Chinese cities</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>An asymmetrical relationship of power?</strong></p>    <p>China’s success in cementing these industrial relationships is partly the result of a non-interventionist policy that does not bring with it any colonial or high-handed diktats on domestic politics or society. “China treats Africa as an equal,” said the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, last year, adding that the relationship was “based as much on mutual respect as on mutual interests”.</p> <p>There is also the sort of regime and policy continuity that comes from being a one-party state. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/uganda-usaid-cuts-photo-essay\">sudden dismantling of USAID</a> under the second Donald Trump administration, and how it left many African and Caribbean projects in the lurch, is a vivid example of how ideology and competing domestic forces can have an impact on foreign partners.</p> <p>But China’s attitude, deferential as it may be in terms of politics, is still accused of being exploitative. China’s epic economic ties are not purely for the accumulation of soft power. There is real benefit to China, as it can leverage the debt it extends to countries to build megaprojects, then gain control of strategic assets, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-power-belt-and-road-caribbean-jamaica-1.5374967\">expand into extracting raw materials,</a> and trap countries in debt.</p> <p>Ultimately, China is transacting with poorer countries in an asymmetrical relationship of power. But as the US withdraws ever further from the world, the entrenchment of China in parts of it suddenly starts to look like a very large footprint. Whatever political era comes next for China on the world stage, it was built in the cities and villages of Africa and the Caribbean.</p> <p><em>• To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/global/2024/oct/16/sign-up-for-the-long-wave-newsletter-our-weekly-black-life-and-culture-email?{{url_parameters_unstripped}}&amp;{{url_parameters_unstripped}}\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/oct/16/sign-up-for-the-long-wave-newsletter-our-weekly-black-life-and-culture-email\">please subscribe here</a>.</em></p>",

    "title": "Why I’m hosting a concert for Palestine at Wembley Arena | Brian Eno",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/gaza-brian-eno-concert-for-palestine-wembley-nelson-mandela",
    "description": "<p>I hope tonight’s gig will have the same galvanising effect as the 1988 Nelson Mandela concert – and give people courage to speak out about Gaza</p>",
    "content": "<p>In the summer of 1988 the music festival producer Tony Hollingsworth organised a concert at Wembley Stadium in London to celebrate the 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela. He offered the BBC the rights to broadcast it live, but the corporation was nervous. Mandela had been in jail since 1962 and, to the extent that he was a well-known figure, he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela\">branded a “terrorist”</a>. Hollingsworth met BBC executive Alan Yentob, who was wavering. “Alan,” Tony said, “you’ve got to bite the bullet.” Eventually Yentob agreed, replying: “I’ll give you five hours. If the bill improves, I’ll increase the time.”</p> <p>Conservative MPs were soon organising a parliamentary motion, deploring the BBC’s editorial decision. Opponents of Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) were right to be worried about the concert. The event was broadcast to a global audience of 600 million people, it made Mandela a household name around the world and, in all probability, hastened his release. Oliver Tambo, then president of the ANC, told Hollingsworth the concert was “the greatest single event we have undertaken in support of the struggle.”</p>    <p>The concert worked because, then as now, politics sits downstream of culture. The stories we tell ourselves and each other are how we develop and share our feelings about this world – and other possible worlds. This gives our storytellers – writers, musicians, artists, actors – incredible power to shape the space in which politicians are able to operate.</p> <p>Which brings us to Gaza.</p> <p>More than any other conflict since the birth of the modern communications age, more so even than South Africa in the 1980s, the Israeli occupation of Palestine<em><strong> </strong></em>has been conducted with words and images as well as with bullets and bombs. And for that reason, those artists who oppose the occupation and advocate for justice for Palestinians have been subjected to a cynical, pernicious censorship designed to severely narrow the scope of the stories they can tell.</p> <p>Examples abound. Last year there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/20/jonathan-glazer-speech-jewish-groups-defense\">concerted campaign</a> by supporters of Israeli policy to have Jewish film-maker Jonathan Glazer cancelled. Actor Melissa Barrera was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/23/melissa-barrera-fired-from-scream-vii-over-israel-hamas-posts-responds-silence-is-not-an-option\">dropped by a Hollywood production company</a> after she posted on social media referring to “genocide” in Gaza. Multiple artists in Germany have had their exhibitions terminated for making entirely defensible critiques of the Israeli government. And the BBC recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/03/gaza-doctors-under-attack-review-channel-4-crucial-film-stuff-of-nightmares\">refused to show</a> a remarkable documentary about Gaza’s health workers because its broadcast would have risked “the <em>perception</em> of partiality” (my italics). It was eventually shown to great acclaim on Channel 4.</p> <p>The BBC’s recent cowardice is the product of a wall of fear constructed by supporters of Israeli government policy, designed to punish those artists whose stories might mould a different culture, one with the power to radically change our politics. But that fear is abating. </p> <p>Take, for example, Together for Palestine, a concert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/08/lineup-together-for-palestine-benefit-concert-wembley-brian-eno-choose-love\">to be held tonight at Wembley Arena</a> – the huge indoor auditorium next to the stadium that hosted that Mandela birthday concert 37 years ago. I and others have been working for a year to bring the concert to life. Even finding a venue proved challenging: the mere mention of the word “Palestine” was a near-certain precursor to refusal. (I wonder what the reaction would have been had it been called Together for Ukraine?) But at some point in the past few months, something changed. Wembley signed a contract, YouTube finally consented to streaming the event, and – most importantly – artists agreed to appear.</p> <p>And so this evening, Wembley hosts the biggest cultural event in support of Palestinian rights since the destruction of Gaza began. Some 12,000 tickets sold out in two hours. Appearing on stage will be, among many others, Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Guy Pearce, musicians Bastille, James Blake, PinkPantheress and Damon Albarn – and Palestinian artists such as Saint Levant and Elyanna. The concert will be opened by Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/11/francesca-albanese-un-gaza-investigator-us-sanctions-guilt\">recently sanctioned by the Trump administration</a>.</p> <p>Five years ago, perhaps even as recently as this time last year, it would have been impossible to imagine dozens of notable global artists coming together to support Palestine. But the brutality of Israel’s assault on Gaza, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/22/gaza-israel-deliberate-starvation-ceasefire-aid\">deliberate starvation of the population</a>, and the unabashed public statements of Israeli ministers advocating ethnic cleansing have combined to create deep cracks in the wall of fear. I’m not sure the Israeli government, or indeed the wider Israeli populace, quite understands the extent to which the censorious policing of commentary around Palestine is breaking down. Indeed, the greater risk to some artists’ reputations may now come from <em>not</em> speaking out on Palestine.</p> <p>One foundation of that wall of fear has been the association of the words “Palestine” and “terror” – the result of a deliberate, decades-long campaign to conflate the two. That same conflation was made in the 1980s with Nelson Mandela. Looking back now, it seems preposterous that debate around South African apartheid could have been so effectively policed by its proponents. But times change. What was once disputed can suddenly become suffused with moral clarity, with advocates for one side left stranded on the wrong side of history. In 2006 the then-Tory leader, David Cameron, said his fellow Conservatives were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/27/conservatives.southafrica\">“wrong” in their approach to apartheid</a>. He praised Mandela as “one of the greatest men alive.”</p> <p>Maybe one day future leaders of western political parties will issue a similar mea culpa for their complicity in the brutal violence currently being inflicted on Palestinian families. It will be too late to save many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">tens of thousands</a> of civilian victims of this war. But if there is a reckoning it might be, in part at least, because actors, artists, writers and musicians helped us to see Palestinians as human beings, as much deserving of respect and protection as their Israeli neighbours.</p> <p>As the Egyptian-Canadian writer Omar El Akkad says, one day everyone will have always been against this.</p> <ul> <li><p>Brian Eno is a musician, artist, composer and producer</p></li> </ul>",

    "description": "<p>The NBA star and actor’s marriage didn’t even last a year. But their relationship catered for eccentrics, misfits, and outsiders</p>",
    "content": "<p>The internet is frothing. This time, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/26/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged\">Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement</a>, a spectacle reminding us how celebrities function as wish machines. Us normies ride shotgun, living vicariously through the highest peaks and, at times, the lowest valleys, making up for our own grayscale lives.</p> <p>But, while Taylor and Travis are about as mainstream as you can get, in the 1990s there was a celebrity couple who catered for the eccentrics, misfits, and outsiders.</p> <p>I remind you of a steamy time in 1998, when Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman married actor, model, and general celebrity Carmen Electra. It was 7am in Vegas. Neon still buzzing. Rodman in sunglasses. Electra in sequins. Chapel of the Flowers. Just nine days later: an annulment. Rodman’s call. His reason? “Unsound mind.” They reconciled but in April 1999 Electra filed for divorce, ending the relationship for good. That chaotic yet brief union affirmed that celebrity love affairs need not be prosaic archetypes. They can be bizarre for those who didn’t see themselves in Disney endings.</p> <p>With Electra, Rodman met his match: a brunette sex symbol with a devoted coterie met the goth NBA hooper who loved Pearl Jam and Lurex crop tops, personifying the grunge era.</p> <p>“With Carmen, it was different. It was nice to be with someone waiting for the right time, right place, right time,” Rodman explained. He expanded on one of their dates: “She was there four or five days, sleeping in my house, in my bed, and we never made love. It was something unreal.”</p> <p>It’s difficult to overstate how omnipresent Electra was in the 1990s. She embodied the decade’s “extreme” media era, when desire and image were pushed to excess. She starred in Baywatch, hosted MTV’s Singled Out, and graced men’s magazines that made her a pop-culture archetype.</p> <p>Rodman, meanwhile, wasn’t conventionally handsome. He was bullied as a kid, pierced and dyed as an adult, but his look gave weirdos hope that they, too, could be desired. Kelce is a perfect jawline and a salon haircut. Rodman is neon hair, piercings, gender-bending fashion, a middle finger to the idea that desirability required conformity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/the-last-dance-spectacular-michael-jordan-netflix\">The Last Dance is spectacular but leaves the real Michael Jordan up in the air | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there’s another layer worth naming. Swift and Kelce represent a very white, very anodyne version of American romance. By contrast, Rodman and Electra were an interracial couple at a time when that still rattled tabloids and provoked coded backlash. Their visibility mattered in the 1990s, a reminder that pop culture could bend not just gender and fashion codes but also racial ones.</p> <p>They whipped the media into a frenzy with their overt PDAs and lusty provocation. Much of this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/the-last-dance-spectacular-michael-jordan-netflix\">chronicled in The Last Dance</a>, which documented Michael Jordan’s quest for a sixth NBA title with the Bulls. In a documentary about the most competitive player and the most controversial dynasty of all time, Rodman’s antics stole focus. Especially the story about how Jordan himself had to arrive in Las Vegas, and pull <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/michael-jordan\">Rodman’s naked ass out of bed</a> and back to practice during the 1998 NBA finals, while Electra hid in horror behind the couch. Electra later admitted the couple had sex in nearly every room of the Bulls’ practice facility. The Marquis de Sade would have surely worn a Rodman jersey.</p> <p>“To hang out in a gay bar or put on a sequined halter top makes me feel like a total person and not just a one-dimensional man,” Rodman once said. Ironic to some, he has been a role model for boys and men who never fit within the confines of traditional masculinity.</p> <p>So it was destined to be combustible when Rodman first crossed paths with Electra in early 1998 at a West Hollywood nightclub he wandered into while the Bulls were in LA to play the Lakers. A friend brought Electra to the bar, a quick introduction, a minute of small talk, and then she was gone. Rodman shrugged it off: “Carmen Electra was another beautiful woman in a long line of beautiful women,” he said of their first meeting.</p> <p>But in the early morning hours, she reappeared. This time, she stuck around, and the two stayed up until nearly dawn. Rodman later said that in those few hours, he began to see a real, unexpected connection.</p> <p>A year later, things had disintegrated. On an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s show, Electra looked back on her marriage to Rodman, which came shortly after she lost her mother and sister in the space of a few weeks.</p> <p>“People couldn’t understand why I loved him because he had a reputation for being a bad boy,” she said. “What I saw in the beginning was this gentle giant that was in a lot of pain – so in a way we understood each other.” She added: “When it was good, it was amazing. And when it was bad, it was the worst.”</p> <p>The contrast with Taylor and Travis is stark: their engagement is a 2025 fairytale for the algorithm. Electra, and Rodman, far less conventional figures, were granted far less grace.</p> <p>Swift has had her share of public romances: Joe Jonas, Harry Styles, Tom Hiddleston, Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy, and others. Each relationship fueled endless headlines, but crucially, her cultural image was never fundamentally tarnished by her dating history. Nor should it have been. On the other hand, Electra was routinely cast as reckless or degraded for her choices, her desirability weaponized against her. The double standard is glaring: what is framed as a romantic odyssey for one woman became, for another, a scarlet letter.</p> <p>By 1999, the volatility spilled over. Rodman and Electra were arrested after an alleged domestic altercation, though <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-xpm-1999-12-01-export64830-story.html\">the charges were eventually dropped</a>.</p> <p>Before his whirlwind marriage to Electra, Rodman had dated other well-known figures: Madonna, model Alicia Douvall, actor Vivica A Fox and, at one point, <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a32578319/dennis-rodman-married-himself/\">even himself</a>. In 1996, Rodman showed up to a New York City signing for his book, Bad As I Wanna Be, in a full bridal gown, complete with veil, horse-drawn carriage, and escorted by female usherettes in tuxedos. He declared he was “bisexual and married to myself,” a stunt that scandalized and fascinated the press.</p> <p>It’s little wonder: where Swift and Kelce’s engagement photos were sweet but bland, Rodman sought to stir things up. He had always enjoyed eschewing gender norms, not just by wearing women’s underwear and make-up, but by marrying himself in a performance art piece to rival Vito Acconci or Chris Burden. Rodman in a veil. Rodman in heels. Rodman as bride, groom, spectacle. Call it dada. Call it punk. Call it the wedding of the century. Rodman has always shown a level of self-awareness in his appearance. “When you put yourself in a woman’s shoes and look at what she has to put up with, it’s not a pretty picture,” he once said.</p> <p>What could have been dismissed as a publicity gimmick felt closer to provocation. Rodman was queering the idea of marriage and selfhood in front of the world. “A lot of people are scared of me, because I bring out feelings and ideas that they’d prefer to keep hidden,” he said.</p> <p>As is the case with Electra – a talented dancer who has been active in numerous charities – – there are many sides to Rodman. He was a prolific writer. “I think crying is beautiful,” he said in 1997’s Walk on the Wild Side. While most NBA legends have written books, Rodman wrote like a punk Arthur Rimbaud – incendiary and impossible to domesticate. Five memoirs, each one wilder than the last: speaking about his sexuality in a way that was, and still mostly is, inconceivable for a male sports star. “Have I ever given a blowjob, or received one from a man, or had anal sex with a dude? NOT YET.” Followed by: “Would I care about his dick size? Hell yeah, I would!” Rodman writes like a man sprinting out of bounds, falling into the crowd, still holding the ball.</p> <p>Swifties have been waiting years for Taylor to find her dream man. Good for them and better for her, she has. As expected, Rodman has dated many women since Electra. He has been married three times, has three children, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/06/trinity-rodman-interview-washington-spirit-soccer-uswnt\">including soccer star Trinity Rodman</a>, and has been with rapper Yella Yella since 2022. Electra has been married and divorced since Rodman. If they found their happy ending, they did so on their own terms.</p> <p>Swift and Kelce’s engagement a ready-made narrative of America’s prom queen meeting her gridiron hero. Rodman and Electra were never that simple. Their relationship burned fast and left behind something more inchoate: a reminder that love stories need not conform to marketable templates. For one witchy, neon-lit year in the late 90s, they proved that misfits and mall goths, freaks and romantics, can have our moment; our myth, not theirs.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>In a modern game peppered with sixes and slanted towards batters, we need the raw beauty of fast bowling more than ever</p>",
    "content": "<p>The ball comes out of his hand at the end of that liquid smooth action. Lissom yet muscular limbs working in unison, it’s so easy on the eye as to be almost laughable. The loping, easy run into the delivery stride, right hip almost knitted to stumps at the non-strikers end. High elbow and rapidly rotating shoulder passing the brim of the umpire’s fedora by barely a millimetre. The ball comes out of his hand at the end of that liquid smooth action and the crowd and the batter hold their breath.</p> <p>“It was exciting, there was an ‘ooh’ or an ‘aah’ every single over,” said Jofra Archer after his devastating spell of fast bowling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">reduced South Africa’s top order to rubble</a> in the third one-day international in Southampton last week. England romped to a record 342-run victory in the dead rubber game, Archer finished with 4 for 18 in nine overs. At one point he had four wickets for the cost of five runs, but this was one of those spells of fast bowling where the numbers didn’t even seem to matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/england-youngest-cricket-captain-deep-end-bethell-ireland-t20\">England’s youngest-ever captain Bethell happy to ‘go in at deep end’ against Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s often said but there is something special about seeing a fast bowler in full flight, at full <em>tilt</em>. Perhaps now more than ever, with bat increasingly dominating ball across the game, with batters peppering the stands and holding the pose, record totals being laid waste and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/02/vaibhav-suryavanshi-ipl-rajasthan-royals-cricket\">cherub-faced teenagers</a> lacerating bowlers on the world stage. It is then an enjoyable recalibration to see perennially six-smiting batters “sat down”; even better to witness them hopping around the crease like someone in a beer garden who has accidentally stepped on a spaniel’s tail. Watch as the ball whistles past their nose, jags past the edge of the bat or flies so close to the stumps that it could whisper sweet nothings into the bail groove as it passes on its way to scorch the keeper’s gloves.</p> <p>Archer’s spell whetted the appetite and gave pangs of nostalgia. Most England fans’ minds would have fast-forwarded a couple of months to Perth and the first Ashes Test in November. The thought of seeing Archer in Australia, back to his best after more than half a decade of debilitating injury and rehab, running amok through the Aussie batting card. It doesn’t just quicken the pulse, it makes it tachycardiac. Take that pure clean hit of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/11/archer-and-bumrah-make-batters-sweat-as-england-and-india-toil-on-day-two-at-lords\">comeback Test wicket</a> of Yashasvi Jaiswal at Lord’s this summer and supercharge it tenfold.</p> <p>Others would also have been reminded of Archer’s spell to Steve Smith at Lord’s in the 2019 Ashes and one of the most visceral periods of fast bowling in recent memory. Long after both men have hung up their boots, that passage of play will be remembered. Most couldn’t tell you what Archer’s figures were in that game or what score Smith made, this was one of those spells that elevates and embeds above most others, leaving the numbers or even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/18/england-australia-ashes-second-test-match-report\">end result of the game</a> to mere admin.</p> <p>Think a wild-eyed and zinc-lipped Allan Donald to a saucer-eyed Michael Atherton at Trent Bridge in 1998. Or, to keep the England v South Africa theme, Andrew Flintoff thundering in like a blond, bulldog-nosed locomotive to Jacques Kallis at Edgbaston 10 years later. The latter usually appeared to be made of granite but, in those few overs of assault from Flintoff, temporarily resembled something more like balsa.</p> <p>That Flintoff spell left its mark on another young fast bowler and future great of the game. A 26-year-old Dale Steyn was on his first Test tour of England, a broken thumb suffered in the first Test at Lord’s meant he was an onlooker in Birmingham. “That’s one of my most vivid memories,” recalls Steyn. “The crowd were just crazy and I had never heard anything like it. They were roaring Flintoff to the crease and it all just felt epic. I wanted a piece of that when I bowled. That theatre and intensity. Seeing that was really special and for me is what Test cricket is all about.”</p>    <p>Most of us will never get close to anything like it, so it prompts the question – what does it feel like to be a fast bowler during one of those spells, when everything is on song, the ball is on a string and the batter may as well be in the palm of your hand? “It sort of clicks” was about as detailed as Ian Botham got when trying to explain the times he got on a hot streak.</p> <p>“Absolutely amazing!” Fortunately, the former England fast bowler Devon Malcolm is less equivocal. “When you’re in good rhythm, everything is so easy. You run up, you’re following through. Everything feels right and there’s no strain on the body. It’s just flowing out. I mean, those times, it’s, you know, it’s just …”</p> <p>Malcolm is momentarily lost in a moment of reverie. Maybe it is quite hard to describe this stuff after all.</p> <p>“I will say this,” he adds after a second or two. “Those spells, those golden days, they make up for all the times when you wake up and can’t get out of bed, when everything aches. So you earn them in a way. All the catches are taken, all the LBs are given, the crowd is behind you and it feels like your moment in the sun.”</p> <p>Steyn retired in 2021; a keen skater, surfer and fisher, he gets his kicks in other ways than fast bowling now. He has also just become a dad for the first time. His head hits the pillow weary but content every night, but there is one feeling he misses.</p> <p>“It’s like a primal thing almost. You feel like you have this incredible power during those spells. You can feel the fear and the excitement and you know you are the reason for it.”</p> <p>And then more specifically: “There’s this moment when the ball leaves your fingers, you can recognise it because it has left your hand so many times, I’m imagining it now … when the ball finishes leaving your middle finger at the very, very, last second, you feel your finger rub down the seam and it lets go, in your mind you know immediately that it’s a good ball, that it’s almost certain to be a wicket. That’s the feeling that I miss.”</p> <p><em>• This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\">To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</a>.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>Preteens are parroting influencer speak, stealing and demanding anti-ageing products. Experts say the pressure to fit in is intense – and the beauty stores aren’t helping</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jessica, <em>25, </em>was working a shift at Sephora when a little girl who looked about 10 ran up to one of her colleagues, crying. “Her skin was burning,” Jessica said, “it was tomato red. She had been running around, putting every acid you can think of on the palm of her hand, then all over her face. One of our estheticians had to tend to her skin. Her parents were nowhere to be seen.”</p> <p>Former Sephora employee KM, 25, has her war stories too. Like the day a woman was caught shoplifting and told the security guard “she was trying to steal because her kid was getting bullied because she didn’t have a Dior lip gloss. [The mom] couldn’t afford it but her daughter told her she is going to get made fun of at school.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way’</p> <footer> <cite>Sephora employee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gaby, 26, worked for Sephora for three years during which time, she said ruefully: “I witnessed so much.” One parent asked Gaby whether her tween “should get a retinol and start preventing anti-ageing now”.</p> <p>Another mother asked Gaby to contour her daughter’s nose to make it look smaller. “When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way.’ It’s not my place to step in and say that, but I really felt like I had to.”</p> <p>The phenomenon of “Sephora kids” – a catch-all phrase for the intense attachment between preteen children, high-end beauty stores and the expensive, sometimes harsh, products that are sold within them – is now well established. In the first half of last year, a third of “prestige” beauty sales were driven by households with tweens and teens, according to the market research firm Circana. The same year, according to Statista, LVMH-owned Sephora racked up around $9bn in US sales, while competitor Ulta Beauty reported sales of $11.3bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/28/she-has-a-hyaluronic-acid-and-niacinamide-serum-the-curious-boom-in-skincare-for-tweens\">‘She has a hyaluronic acid and niacinamide serum’: the curious boom in skincare for tweens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trend is driven by skincare content produced by beauty influencers – many of whom are tweens and teens themselves. The videos they post put kids’ sensitive skin at “significant dermatological risk”, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/tiktok-skincare-routines-for-teens-are-more-harmful-than-you-may-think-and-many-dont-contain-this-crucial-step/3763793/\">first peer-reviewed study</a> on the phenomenon, published in June by Northwestern University. Its analysis found that skincare routines posted by teens and tweens on TikTok contained<em> </em>an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients per routine, which risked causing acute reactions and triggering lifelong allergies.</p> <p>Sephora has tried to distance itself from the trend (“we do not market to this audience,” said Artemis Patrick, president and CEO of Sephora North America, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fortune_sephora-north-america-ceo-on-gen-alpha-activity-7253091213979922432-6jEn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">in a recent Fortune interview</a>). Being seen to sell anti-ageing products to children is not a good look. Last year, the skincare brand Drunk Elephant became intrinsically linked with the trend, when its brightly packaged creams became a status symbol for tweenage kids, some of whom reported skin reactions to harsh ingredients. It recently reported a 65% decline in sales, which most analysts pegged to the brand losing touch with the adult customers it had been designed for.</p> <p>Despite this, the situation has dug its neon-pink nails in this summer, according to a selection of current and former Sephora workers the Guardian spoke to. Every single one of these young women expressed concern about what they have witnessed on the shop floor.</p> <p>Summer is peak time for Sephora kids: school is out and third spaces are <a href=\"https://theweek.com/culture-life/third-places-disappearing\">notoriously scarce</a>. The high-shine environment of the beauty store – brightly lit, soundtracked by loud music, full of lotions and tubs in vivid hues – can feel like a magnet for children.</p>    <p>Toddlers run around unsupervised, wreaking havoc with displays, knocking down banners or filling shopping baskets to the brim with testers while their parents were elsewhere in the store, according to the workers I spoke to. Or parents were pacifying kids with “a full-blast YouTube video”, said KM, who calls her store’s tiniest inhabitants “free range kids”.</p> <p>Kennedy works in a Sephora concession within a Kohl’s department store right across from the junior’s clothing section and believes that “cross traffic is very intentional,” she said. Kids stream in all day. “Parents will drop their kids in Sephora and then wander the rest of Kohl’s, and I won’t see them until checkout.” At that point, she said, some parents will materialize, often without looking at the specific products their child wants. “I had that happen with a dad recently. He was on his phone the whole time, swiped his card for $200 not even thinking about it.”</p> <p>Workers I spoke to also said they had tried to dissuade younger kids from buying harsh products from brands designed for more mature skin.</p> <p>Sometimes, even with a parent present, the advice is not always heeded, said Gaby. “They’re just like,<em> ‘</em>Well, my daughter really wants this, can you just grab it?’” said Jessica, a former Sephora worker. “I remember one circumstance where a kid who looked about nine wanted to buy a lot of Drunk Elephant products: the retinol, the glycolic acid.” When Jessica warned one mother that the products were too harsh for her child’s skin, she responded: “Well, we just saw it on TikTok,” and “ended up buying everything”.</p> <p>When parents do listen, there are sometimes tense exchanges in store. From tweenagers pleading: “But I saw this online, it’s supposed to be good!” said KM, to “little kid type tantrums. You know: ‘I want a lip gloss!’ And the mom’s like, ‘You’re six, you don’t need a lip gloss!’”</p>    <p>All the workers were sure that many of these products were going unused. Once a beauty product is opened and sits on a shelf for a while, it goes bad, points out KM: “It’s just landfill.” Overconsumption has been a concern.</p> <p>Shoplifting – or “shrink” in store parlance – is also a big issue. “I find so many empty boxes of product at work all the time,” said Gaby. There was a “whole trend of ‘borrowing’ on TikTok”, said Erica, 28, referring to a euphemism for shoplifting she believes has contributed to some kids getting very adept at the practice.</p> <p>It is common for kids to use their parents’ credit cards. “They bring out those silver American Express cards, the ones that are metal. And I’m like, ‘That’s definitely not yours,’” said Gaby. Erica said she has seen little girls who look around eight say casually to their parents: “‘I want to get this. Let me just use your card.’” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks like</p> <footer> <cite>Sephora employee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This behavior has tied into an overall impression of preteen children behaving like little adults. Kennedy described it as as a “weird entitlement”. Kids might come in on their phone, holding a Starbucks cup almost as big as they are. She said she has heard preteen girls say phrases like, “I’m going to have to start anti-ageing soon.” They are almost always joking, she said, yet “even if it’s said in jest, it is strange. They want to act mature and have the grownup experience of shopping at Sephora, but there is also this deep seated societal fear of anti-ageing permeating the mind of a 10-year-old.”</p> <p>For Joy, a 25-year-old Sephora worker, the trend is “all about appearance”. The visual landscape of social media is “a lot of pressure” for girls, she said: “Celebrities and influencers in their 50s still look like they are my age,” and kids notice that. “Little do they know, it’s probably a doctor involved.”</p> <p>Erica said baby-faced preteens sometimes approach her in store saying things like, “‘Do you think I have pores?’ They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks like.”</p> <p>Dr Meghan Owenz, a clinical associate professor at Florida International University and therapist specializing in parenting and anxiety, said that it is normal for preteen girls to start caring about personal hygiene at their age. The pressures, however, have shifted for their generation, as they figure out how to deal with questions like: “‘What’s everybody else doing – and how do I fit in there?’ If we insert social media at that time then they’re flooded with this information.”</p>    <p>Children cultivating a sense of belonging through products – whether sneakers or Beanie Babies or Pokémon cards – is nothing new. Yet generation Alpha, those born after 2010, is facing a unprecedent amount of marketing messages for years: <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/razorfish-com-assets/image/upload/v1690246086/assets/news-articles/exploring-generation-alpha/razorfish-tl-exploring-generation-alpha.pdf\">43% of gen Alpha in the US had tablets before the age of six</a> and 58% received their first iPhone by age 10, according to one survey. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37721985/\">US government research from 2023 </a>described social media use as “nearly universal” at 95% use for those age 13 to 17 and nearly 40% for those age eight to 12 (despite the age limit being set at 13 for many platforms). These are platforms on which the boundary between paid advertising and impartial content is blurred to the point of non-existence, particularly in the world of beauty influencers.</p> <p>KM has begun to notice an eerie Invasion of the Body Snatchers language among tiny customers who talk in influencer-ese: “I’m here for my back-to-school glow,” or “I’m here for my back-to-school lip balm,” they might say. Or they just “repeat the actual product name over and over again, like they saw someone promote it but they have no idea what it actually does”.</p> <p>Owenz believes the inundation of paid influencers who “talk about ‘my skincare routine’ and ‘get ready with me,’” leads to children mimicking their behavior as a “developmentally appropriately … way to fit in”. Owenz added: “The problem is for girls is that they cannot possibly live up to what they see on social media financially, physically or otherwise.”</p> <p>“It has gotten harder to say no, because there’s so much advertising to our kids all the time,” Owenz added. “Kids are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure – and they’re going to pressure their parents more.” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[The kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same product</p> <footer> <cite>former Sephora employee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It remains the case, she said, that it is the parent’s job to “discern what’s appropriate for them and say: ‘No, it’s not appropriate. Here’s the reason.’”</p> <p>But California assemblymember Alex Lee believes putting the onus should not solely be on parents, in part because beauty companies are not obligated to feature clear labels or warning – only very long lists of ingredients. “Your average parent is not a pediatric dermatologist,” he said. Lee has twice tried to introduce a bill stopping stores from selling products containing ingredients such as retinol and glycolic acid to kids under 18. The Personal Care Product Council – which represents the interests of the beauty industry – lobbied against the bills, which have both failed to pass. In Lee’s view, the industry is unwilling to do anything to disrupt its relationship with children it believes will be customers for life.</p> <p>Many of the workers I spoke to believed that many beauty brands stocked by Sephora had started targeting this customer base, whether or not they would admit it. Kennedy has noticed shifts: brands suddenly redesigning packaging to be more colorful, adding tween-friendly products such as lip oils and blushes to skincare lines initially intended for more mature skin. Some brands encourage a collection mindset, said Gaby. “They will come out with a limited-edition matcha-flavored lip balm, or iced coffee, or pink guava – and [the kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same product.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/27/joyless-children-fixated-on-anti-ageing-skincare\">Why are our children obsessed with anti-ageing treatments? Take a look in the mirror | Barbara Ellen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sephora, Ulta and Drunk Elephant did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment for this story. Generally though, the skincare industry’s response has been to launch more product ranges specifically designed for very young skin. Many walk a line between palatable messages for parents and social media-influenced and marketing strategies – such as drumming fingernails on closeup shots of bottles – aimed at preteens.</p> <p>The trend rolls on: children have been hosting birthday parties within some Sephora and Ulta stores on an ad-hoc basis for some time, but last month Ulta made it official with the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1misiqe/is_this_event_new_for_ulta_stores/\">launch of a $42-per-guest birthday party package</a>, offering “75 – 90 minutes of beauty fun” using “healthy, gentle” products formulated “with tweens and teens in mind”. As if to underline the sense that such initiatives are about grooming – in more than one sense – on their big day, the “guest of honor” will be gifted the opportunity to spend yet more money with the brand, receiving a 20% off coupon to use when they return for their next shopping trip.</p>    <p><em>Some names have been changed to protect the identities of current Sephora employees.</em></p> <p><em>Illustrations by Min Heo</em><em><br></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>York Theatre Royal<br></strong>Propulsive show with a sometimes cliched script takes inspiration from the choir formed by local women while their husbands were in Afghanistan</p>",
    "content": "<p>In writer-director Debbie Isitt’s new musical, the women of the title are surrounded by cardboard boxes. As Katie Lias’s set design makes clear, these are precarious lives, regularly packed up and moved from one military base to the next. The promise of the <a href=\"https://www.militarywiveschoirs.org/our-story\">Military Wives Choirs</a> – originated up the road from York Theatre Royal at Catterick Garrison and the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/04/gareth-malone-choir-army-wives\">BBC documentary</a> and subsequent film from which this show takes inspiration – is that they offer connection in a rootless existence.</p>    <p>While based on the true story and hitting some of the same plot beats as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/06/military-wives-review-kristin-scott-thomas-helps-feelgood-britcom-sing\">Peter Cattaneo’s 2019 film</a>, Isitt’s version has its own cast of fictional characters. The show quickly introduces us to a disparate group of women who are brought together when upbeat outsider Olive arrives to form a singing group for the wives while their partners are on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Though it sacrifices the emotional heft of the movie’s central partnership, this take on the material adopts a fittingly ensemble approach, illustrating the power of community at the story’s heart.</p> <p>Isitt’s storytelling is propulsive and pacy, if somewhat reliant on contrivance and soapy tropes. Each of the women in the choir has her own emotionally loaded subplot – a baby on the way, a round of IVF, a struggling marriage – most of which are quickly and easily resolved (usually with a tear-jerking ballad thrown in). The more striking and moving moments arrive when frontline conflict explodes into the choir’s rehearsal room, theatrically juxtaposing the two worlds these women straddle and reminding us of the life-and-death stakes faced by their partners.</p> <p>The show is transparent in its pressing of emotional buttons, engineering moments of high drama that just as rapidly melt away again, while its comic rhythms start to become predictable. But what comes across most convincingly is the sheer joy found in singing together. Performing a score of familiar pop, rock and Motown hits, the excellent cast bring an infectious energy to this material, lifting the sometimes cliched script and connecting with a story that has deep local resonances.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/show/military-wives-the-musical/\">York Theatre Royal</a> until 27 September</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>Marc Skinner has likened the Manchester United striker Melvine Malard’s persona to that of Eric Cantona. The head coach compared the Frenchwoman to the club’s revered former forward as he reflected on the top form Malard appears to have hit before Thursday’s decisive Women’s Champions League qualifier.</p> <p>Manchester United are 1-0 down going into the second leg against the Norwegian side Brann but were boosted by Malard’s double in their 5-1 victory at London City Lionesses in the Women’s Super League on Sunday.</p> <p>Malard is the WSL’s leading goalscorer, with four goals from the first two games. That is as many as her WSL total last season and Skinner described the 25-year-old, who is in her third campaign at the club, as an “extremely talented player”. Assessing Malard’s improvement he said: “She now understands the language happily, so it’s easier to translate quicker in-game for her, so she can get instruction, take it on board, and perform it.</p> <p>“I’d also say, Mel is probably the most ‘Manchester United’ player I’ve ever met. And what I mean by that is, if I look and I go back – and this is a big shout – to the Eric Cantona kind of personalities; she has that personality. She can carry pressure moments and do it with a smile. And I think that psychology is what stands her apart this season.”</p> <p>If United knock out Brann they will in Friday’s 11am BST draw for the new league phase of the Champions League. Arsenal and Chelsea are the WSL’s guaranteed representatives among the 18 clubs.</p> <p>United will be without the defender Millie Turner, who sustained a knee injury on Sunday. Skinner said it was not an anterior cruciate, lateral collateral or medial collateral ligament injury. “We’re just looking at the knee cap,” he said. “She’s got another meeting towards the end of this week. But it’s not what people probably feared, which is good news, but once we’ve had this second opinion, we’ll discuss what it looks like.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>The late frontman refused to adhere to the lyrical conventions of the genre, surveying suffering in a peerless wailing screech that will echo across the history of heavy music</p>",
    "content": "<p>Tomas Lindberg was not the voice of death metal – he was so much better than that. During his 35-year career fronting Swedish band At the Gates, he never toed the line, never grunted about loving violence and hating Christianity because the genre dictated that you do so. Rather, he ripped up the rulebook with both his messaging and his delivery, setting a new standard for distinctiveness in extreme music.</p> <p>Lindberg – who has passed away aged 52 after being diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare oral cancer – was fascinated with suffering. Yet, unlike his peers, he was seldom concerned with the suffering caused by a chainsaw or organised religion. It was the suffering inside of us, rooted in our own expectations, trauma and follies. “Twenty-two years of pain and I can feel it closing in,” goes the bridge of 1995’s semi-autobiographical fan-favourite track Cold. “The will to rise above, tearing my insides out.” And Lindberg delivered each line not with a typical, guttural rumble, but with a wailing screech that made all that anguish feel even more real.</p> <p>Born on 16 October 1972, Lindberg co-founded At the Gates in Gothenburg in 1990. They started as a somewhat lumbering musical entity, with early albums The Red in the Sky Is Ours and With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness attempting to push the death metal envelope using extended run times, structure-agnostic songwriting and violin solos.</p> <p>The band tightened up after guitarist/composer Alf Svensson left in 1993 and broke into a thrash metal-inspired sprint on the 1994 EP Terminal Spirit Disease. But Lindberg’s agonised poetry remained a constant. The singer <a href=\"https://www.invisibleoranges.com/interview-tomas-lindberg-at-the-gates/\">told Invisible Oranges in 2010</a>: “The whole concept of writing lyrics for me has always been to work myself through different subjects and to try to find my own standpoint, to not be guided by already fixed ideas.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCtjAmtIGf0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCtjAmtIGf0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>At the Gates: Blinded by Fear – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1995, not long after a disastrous UK tour left the band furious and near penniless (at one point the band were left stranded in a Norwich car park for several days), At the Gates recorded their magnum opus, Slaughter of the Soul. Their frustration manifested across a blisteringly quick 34 minutes, ignoring all frills and breaking extreme metal down to its bare components: two or three riffs per song, chugging rhythm guitars comparable to Metallica, and histrionic harmonies influenced by Iron Maiden. With Lindberg at his most lyrically introspective (“Sweet nauseating pain, is death the only release?” he sang on Blinded by Fear) the material was as relatable as it was high-octane, and it became a surprise international hit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/21/lowen-metal-band-iran-authoritarianism\">‘Israel and Iran’s governments aren’t good. Neither is ours’: Lowen, the metal band confronting a troubled Middle East</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Gates barely got to enjoy the fruits of their labour, breaking up in 1996 after lead guitarist and co-founder Anders Björler and his brother, bassist Jonas, stepped down. They didn’t return until 2007. “We were so young, inexperienced and unused to coping with outside, or internal, pressure,” Lindberg <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/gates-discuss-new-album-war-reality\">explained during a 2014 Guitar World interview</a>. “There’s no real communication when you’re 20.” However, their absence lent their music a quasi-mythical quality, and it piqued the intrigue of future members of such US bands as Trivium, Killswitch Engage and Lamb of God. Openly inspired by At the Gates’ fusion of power and melody, they became some of the biggest stars in metal during the midtolate 2000s.</p> <p>Once At the Gates returned, they put out three more albums and toured frequently, while Lindberg balanced the band with other musical projects and a job as a social studies teacher, not that his pupils were fussed. “What’s interesting is that it’s usually other teachers who think you’re cool,” he <a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/news/at-the-gates-tomas-lindberg-discusses-being-a-social-studies-teacher\">told Loudwire in 2021</a>. “They want to know about touring stories [but] I’m like, um, no. I’d rather be the nice-but-a-bit-boring teacher.”</p> <p>Lindberg was diagnosed with cancer in December 2023 but kept his condition hidden from fans until last month, when At the Gates issued a statement saying that he was “being closely monitored around the clock”. Three decades after Slaughter of the Soul made his band global idols, the singer’s cliche-breaking words and passionate screaming still feel like a benchmark that no death metal vocalist is likely to touch again.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has pleaded not guilty to five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault at Southwark crown court.</p> <p>The 32-year-old is accused of raping two women and sexually assaulting a third woman. The alleged offences took place between 2021 and 2022, when he was an Arsenal player.</p> <p>Partey spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and his not guilty pleas during a plea and preparation hearing on Wednesday.</p> <p>Partey’s court appearance came after he came on as a second-half substitute for Villarreal in his team’s 1-0 defeat by Spurs in the Champions League at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday night.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Christopher Hehir told Partey: “Your trial will take place at this court on 2 November of next year, 2026. I appreciate that is quite a long way in advance. As you may appreciate the crown courts have a huge backlog of work which means that trials do take a long time to come on. Because you have bail effectively you are sitting behind a queue of people in prison who are waiting to be tried.”</p>    <p>The judge granted bail on the same conditions as Partey was placed under at a hearing last month. They are that he cannot contact any of the three women and must notify police of any permanent changes of address or international travel. He continues to play for Ghana.</p> <p>Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in 2020 in a transfer worth about £45m. The defensive midfielder had signed for the Spanish club in 2012 and made 188 appearances, as well as going out on loan to Mallorca and Almería. Partey joined Villarreal in August on a free transfer.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Teen romance and paranoid surveillance collide to dysfunctional effect in Neo Sora’s beguiling debut future set in an oppressive near-future</p>",
    "content": "<p>Neo Sora is a Japanese film-maker who directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/28/ryuichi-sakamoto-opus-review-neo-sora\">Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus, a documentary about his father</a>, the renowned composer. Now he has made his feature debut with this complex, beguiling and often brilliant movie, co-produced by Anthony Chen; it manages to be part futurist satire, part coming-of-age dramedy, part high school dystopia. It combines the spirit of John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club with Lindsay Anderson’s If.… and there might even be a trace memory of Paul Schrader’s Mishima, only without the seppuku.</p> <p>In a high school in Kobe in the future, students are oppressed by the reactionary xenophobia of their elders; periodic earthquake warnings, and actual earthquakes themselves, create a widespread air of suppressed panic which the authorities believe justifies a perpetual clampdown. The prime minister has taken to claiming that undesirable elements are taking advantage of the earthquakes to indulge in lawlessness. In the school, there is an almost unconcealed racist disdain for students who are not fully ethnic Japanese as well as those who have unorthodox or rebellious views.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkPTH_gKZxw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LkPTH_gKZxw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One morning, the principal (Shirô Sano) is infuriated to see that some prankster has turned his shiny new yellow car up on its end in the school grounds, like a Stonehenge monolith. With some reason, he suspects the school’s cool-kid gang of rebels who, encouraged by liberal teacher Mr Okada (Ayumu Nakajima), have been allowed to hang out together in the “music research room”. They are Yuta (Hayato Kurihara), Fumi (Kilala Inori), Korean-Japanese Kou (Yukito Hidaka), Chinese student Ming (Shina Peng), African-American student Tom (Arazi) (who plans on joining his family in Detroit on graduation), and nerdy Ata-chan (Yûta Hayashi).</p> <p>However the glowering principal can’t prove anything, and the film itself does not show exactly who did this stunt or how on earth they managed it. But in a spiteful and retaliatory spirit he installs a video surveillance and face-recognition system in the school, brand-named Panopty (clearly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham\">Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon</a> prison design) which spies on the students’ every move. This Orwellian setup creates a massive dysfunction in the school, like a collective nervous breakdown, perhaps especially for Yuta and Kou, for whom the school’s calamitous loss of privacy perhaps means that, even as they heroically challenge this new oppression, they cannot acknowledge their feelings for each other.</p> <p>This is a movie that refuses to give us clear storylines, clear characterisations, clear meanings; even the fierce principal himself might not be quite so strict as all that. It’s a very stylish, thoughtful, heartfelt movie in which regular teen heartbreak might be quite as important as any political commentary.</p> <p>• Happyend is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September. Limited release in the US. Available to stream in Australia</p>",

    "content": "<p>Channel 4 will be marking Donald Trump’s visit to the UK with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/channel-4-donald-trump-uk-state-visit-reel-of-untruths\">what it describes</a> as “the longest uninterrupted reel of untruths, falsehoods and distortions ever broadcast on television”. It will play more than 100 of Trump’s lies or misleading statements in a segment called Trump v The Truth. All his greatest hits, from false claims about the price of eggs to disgusting lies about the US spending millions on condoms for Hamas, packaged together.</p> <p>Obviously we’ve got to be fair and balanced here, though, haven’t we? Gotta show both sides. So I think it’s only right that Channel 4 also broadcast a 10-second segment covering all of the truthful and astute things the president has said. It’s not just lies, lies, lies: occasionally the man can be surprisingly wise. Only this week, for example, <a href=\"https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1967233388147847434\">a video circulated online</a> of Trump telling attendees of a gala at one of his golf clubs: “Smart people don’t like me, you know?” He added: “And they don’t like what we talk about.” No lies detected there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/channel-4-donald-trump-uk-state-visit-reel-of-untruths\">Channel 4 to mark Trump’s UK visit with ‘longest uninterrupted reel of untruths’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there are Trump’s thoughts on the fate of his immortal soul. Last month, early on a Tuesday morning, the president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/trump-heaven.html\">dialled into Fox &amp; Friends</a> and said he is trying to stop the war in Ukraine so that God can save him a spot in paradise. “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible,” he explained. “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.” While it’s impossible to fact-check exactly where Trump is on God’s waiting list, I suspect he has made a correct assessment of the situation. And I think all the dead children in Gaza, which Trump has said he wants the US to take over and turn into a luxury resort, might agree.</p> <p>Trump has also been blunter about the political process than some of his predecessors. While running for <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-surprisingly-honest-lessons-big-money-politics/story?id=32993736\">president in 2015</a>, he matter-of-factly said that he had used his money to influence politicians. “I gave to many people before this,” he said during a Republican candidates’ debate. “And you know what, when I need something from them two years later … I call them. They are there for me. That’s a broken system.” Truer words have never been spoken; certainly not by Trump.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s ugly speech. There’s gross speech. There’s evil speech,” Kirk wrote. “And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment. Keep America free.”</p> <p>Bondi’s talk of targeting people who use “hate speech” is not legal because the “first amendment creates very, very strong protections from punishment for speech that’s offensive or for speech with which people disagree. The bar for punishing speech based on content, and especially based on viewpoint, is extremely, extremely high,” Northwestern’s Kitrosser said.</p> <p>Following the backlash, Bondi, who already faced calls to resign for how she handled files related to sex trafficker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, appeared to try to walk back her comments on Tuesday.</p> <p>“Freedom of speech is sacred in our country, and we will never impede upon that right,” Bondi said in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/16/bondi-clarifies-hate-speech-not-prosecute\">statement to Axios</a>. “My intention was to speak about threats of violence that individuals incite against others.”</p> <p>Kitrosser, however, said she remained “very concerned as to how broadly they are going to define what is an illegal threat and as to what other loopholes they may try to carve out from existing free speech case law”.</p> <p>She added: “I think that we all need to remain very vigilant.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Authorities say they no longer have legal justification to hold Christian Brückner in jail after serving rape sentence</p>",
    "content": "<p>The main suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann was freed on Wednesday as German authorities said they no longer had legal justification to hold him in jail.</p> <p>Christian Brückner, 49, was released from prison in Sehnde, northern Germany, after serving a sentence for the rape of an American woman, then 72 years old, in Portugal in 2005, journalists at the scene reported.</p> <p>The rape took place in Praia da Luz, the holiday resort on the southern Portuguese coast where the three-year-old British toddler disappeared 18 months later.</p> <p>Brückner was driven away from the prison entrance by his lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, in a black Audi A6 at 9.14am local time, accompanied by a police escort. Brückner, who police confirmed was covered in a blanket and sitting on the back seat, could not be seen owing to tinted windows. The car travelled northwards, taking him to an unknown destination.</p> <p>German prosecutors say that Brückner, a German national, remains their prime suspect in the disappearance, which they are treating as a murder inquiry. British police call him a suspect in their investigation, which they continue to treat as a missing-persons case.</p> <p>State prosecutors responsible for the investigation confirmed to German media on Wednesday morning that Brückner would have to wear an electronic ankle tag so that his movements could be tracked. His lawyer had tried to object to this, they said. He will also have to surrender his passport, is forbidden from travelling abroad and must declare a permanent place of residence, which he may not leave without permission.</p> <p>However, his lawyers have said they plan to appeal against the supervision order. Philipp Marquort told Der Spiegel: “This is the public prosecutor’s attempt to keep him in a kind of pretrial detention where they have access to him at any time.”</p> <p>Madeleine went missing on 3 May 2007 while on holiday with her parents. She vanished from the ground-floor apartment where the family was staying, while her parents were at a restaurant close by. Her young twin siblings had been in the room with her.</p> <p>Hans Christian Wolters, a lead investigator in the case, reiterated in a recent interview his belief that Brückner was responsible for the girl’s disappearance. “We believe that he is responsible for the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and that he killed Madeleine McCann,” he said in a recent statement.</p> <p>Wolters told the AFP news agency last year that he believed Brückner was “fundamentally dangerous”. “He has not undergone any therapy or similar treatment in prison, which means that, from our point of view, we must assume that he will reoffend,” Wolters said.</p> <p>German police have been investigating Brückner since 2017. State prosecutors have said they have circumstantial evidence indicating his possible involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance. These include that his mobile phone was on and logged in in the area where she vanished, and the sworn testimony of three witnesses who say he confessed to them.</p> <p>After being alerted about Brückner, following a TV crime programme in Germany that called for information a decade after the child’s disappearance, the federal criminal police office named him as a suspect in 2020. They revealed he had convictions going back decades for child sexual abuse and other crimes, including drug trafficking, burglary and petty theft.</p> <p>Brückner had lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007, and had worked at the Praia da Luz resort as a pool maintenance assistant.</p> <p>The investigation has also involved several searches of land and property connected to Brückner, in Portugal and Germany.</p> <p>Last October, Brückner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/main-suspect-in-mccann-disappearance-acquitted-in-separate-and-abuse-trial\">cleared by a court</a> in the northern German city of Braunschweig of several unrelated sexual offences, alleged to have occurred between 2000 and 2017. He has consistently denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p> <p>The public prosecutor’s office appealed against this verdict, and a review is still pending by the federal court of justice.</p> <p>He is due back in court in Oldenburg in October for a hearing into an incident in which he is accused of insulting a member of prison staff.</p> <p>A court hearing is also listed for 27 October in Oldenburg in north-west Germany, to deal with a case in which he is accused of insulting a prison employee.</p> <p>Before Brückner’s release, Fülscher said in a statement that no comment would be made to the media outside the prison either by him or his client. Brückner has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/prime-madeleine-mccann-suspect-refuses-met-interview-before-german-prison-release\">refused a request</a> by British authorities, made through an “international letter of request”, for an interview on his release.</p> <p>DCI Mark Cranwell, a senior investigating officer for London’s Metropolitan police, said the request had been “refused by the suspect”. He added that the Met would “nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry”.</p> <p>After completing his seven-and-a-half-year sentence for the 2005 rape, Brückner had been expected to stay behind bars until January 2026 because he owed €1,447 (£1,253) in fines for a separate offence. However, a former police officer who had worked on the investigation into Brückner paid the fine because she said she “felt sorry” for him. She has since said she made a mistake.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Lucy Powell has hit out at the “sexist” framing of her deputy Labour leadership campaign, with people claiming she and her rival, Bridget Phillipson, are standing as “proxies” for two men.</p> <p>With the contest to replace Angela Rayner under way this week, the pair have been forced to contend with political rumours that they are stalking horses for a future leadership battle.</p> <p>It has been heavily speculated that Andy Burnham, a longtime ally of Powell, is among the senior Labour figures eyeing up a leadership challenge if the prime minister’s recent turmoil continues. Phillipson, meanwhile, is seen as a Keir Starmer loyalist.</p> <p>Powell, the MP for Manchester Central and former cabinet minister, lost her role as leader of the Commons in the recent reshuffle. According to a survey by LabourList, Powell is 17 percentage points ahead of Phillipson in the contest.</p> <p>Asked if her campaign was essentially a “stalking horse” for Burnham, she told BBC’s Political Thinking podcast: “It’s just Westminster bubble obsession that, isn’t it?</p> <p>“Really, you’ve got two strong women in an open and transparent contest. And instead of talking about the two strong women, everybody’s talking about this being a sort of proxy for war between two men, which, quite honestly, I find kind of sexist.”</p> <p>She had warned previously that the contest must not be turned into a shadow battle between Burnham and Starmer, telling the Manchester Evening News: “Woe betide anyone who wants to try and tell me that I’m subservient to some other man. I’m probably more alpha male than most men I know.”</p> <p>Powell insisted her aim for the deputy Labour leadership was to unite Labour’s values with the voters its politicians claimed to serve.</p> <p>Asked if she would be proposing ideas before Rachel Reeves’s budget, Powell said: “I think it’s really important that I don’t, and we don’t in this contest try and sort of write some alternative budget or some alternative policy programme.</p> <p>“But I am here to say, look, let’s communicate much more strongly what our values are, what our motivations are, whose side we are on, and connect that back to our communities through our great movement which is our strength.”</p> <p>Powell, who once described herself as an “egg-breaker”, said it was clear lifting the two-child benefit cap “would be the single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty” and she urged ministers to be clearer about wanting to scrap it, adding: “The question is how and the when.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-america-donald-trump-britain\">Keir Starmer is betting everything on an America that doesn’t exist any more | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She added that her campaign drew lessons from her Manchester constituency, where older, working-class voters in the outskirts of the city coexisted with younger professionals in the centre. “It’s how we unite them together,” she said. She argued it was wrong for Labour strategists to be focused only on one type of voter, or attempting to “out-Reform” Nigel Farage’s party.</p> <p>Powell said it was a “kind of shock but not a total surprise” to lose her cabinet job as Commons leader, but she claimed maybe she was passing on too much honest feedback to No 10.</p> <p>“I know I’m not really in the in-crowd, and I don’t really sort of play some of the parlour games,” she said. “I had fed back things that weren’t, with hindsight – maybe I thought I was doing the job I was supposed to be doing – but maybe that wasn’t feedback people wanted to hear.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Bob Woodward, the journalist played by Robert Redford in the 1976 corruption exposé All the President’s Men, has paid tribute to the actor who died on Tuesday, saying he was “a noble and principled force for good”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/realBobWoodward/status/1968031116184686754\">In a statement posted on social media</a>, Woodward said that Redford and he had been friends for 50 years and that he “admired him – for his friendship, his fiery independence, and the way he used any platform he had to help make the world better, fairer, brighter for others”.</p> <p>Woodward said Redford played a key role in exposing the events of the Watergate scandal, saying that the actor had “urged Carl Bernstein and myself to tell the Watergate story through the eyes and experiences of our reporting”, resulting in the publication of their book All the President’s Men in June 1974 (which preceded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon#Resignation\">Nixon’s resignation in August 1974</a>), and the subsequent film, for which Redford had acquired the book’s screen rights and in which he co-starred with Dustin Hoffman.</p> <p>In his statement Woodward also quoted recent conversations he had had with Redford. The actor said he had rewatched All the President’s Men in 2021 and was “taken aback at how appropriate it was, how timely it was, and how little has really changed. We don’t have Nixon any more, we have Trump.”</p> <p>Redford added: “We live in a country where we can’t call ourselves the United States of America. We just can’t. We’re the Divided States of America because of the political parties and they’re so robust in their anxieties.”</p> <p>Redford also commented directly on Trump, after Woodward suggested Trump was trying to destroy democracy. “[Trump] doesn’t understand [democracy]. So it’s easy for him to destroy it. It’s easy to destroy something you don’t understand. You can claim it doesn’t exist.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/17/my-weird-wild-week-of-wearing-shoulder-pals",
    "description": "<p>The latest craze for the kidult market is small stuffed toys you attach to your clothes. But can you look cool – or even just socially acceptable – while wearing them?</p>",
    "content": "<p>There was a time when adults who owned collections of stuffed toys were relatively uncommon, weird even. All that has changed recently: the rise in popularity of toys such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/squishmallows-toys-collecting\">Squishmallows</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/08/shoplifters-scams-and-supersoft-toys-how-the-jellycat-craze-inspired-a-wave\">Jellycat Amuseables</a> has been linked to the growing “kidult” market (adults buying toys for themselves) which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/pocket-money-toys-uk-costs-sales-2024-lego\">accounted for almost 30% of toy sales</a> last year. On the whole, cuddly toys are something people keep at home, on their beds or on display shelves. But that’s changing too – plush toy keyrings such as Labubus are now everywhere. And some “Disney adults” (self-professed grown up Disney fans who might, for example, go to the theme parks without taking children with them) have gone one step further: attaching toys not just to their bags, but to themselves.</p> <p>“Shoulder pals” (variously known as “shoulder plushies”, “shoulder toys” and “shoulder sitters”) are small toys made in the likeness of Disney characters. They have magnetic bases and come with a flat metal plate designed to be placed under your shirt, so the toy perches on your shoulder. Since the first one, baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, was brought out in 2018, these toys have become a common accessory at the Disney theme parks. There are multiple Reddit threads and TikTok videos about how to track down the latest ones (some are sold at the Disney store, but others are only available at specific locations within the parks). There will apparently be 45 official Disney shoulder pals on offer by the end of next year, with characters ranging from Peter Pan’s Tinker Bell to Anxiety from Inside Out 2. That’s not to mention the many, many knockoffs available online, as well as those sold by <a href=\"https://www.primark.com/en-gb/p/marvel-groot-shoulder-plush-toy-brown-991092655616\">Primark</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gentlyelsie/video/7352206794556525857\">DIY pals</a> that some creative TikTok users have been making.</p> <p>What is it about these toys that makes them so appealing? And what’s it like to actually wear them? As a plush toy novice – the only one I own is my beloved childhood teddy bear, Freddie, who was banished to a box under the bed with the Christmas decorations some time ago – I ordered two from the Disney store: Stitch from Lilo &amp; Stitch, and the Raven from Haunted Mansion, plus three that I tracked down on eBay: the Cheshire cat from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Pascal (Rapunzel’s lizard friend in Tangled) and Ratatouille’s Remy, the most popular shoulder pal to date. I spent more than £100 in total: the Disney store price was £21 per toy, and though I managed to get Remy secondhand for slightly less, the Cheshire cat, which is one of the newer releases, cost me just over £30. Being a Disney adult, it turns out, is not cheap.</p>    <h2>Day one</h2> <p>Stitch and the Raven are the first to arrive, and are cuter and softer than I was expecting. Though it feels ridiculous to “wear” a toy, there is something very pleasing about the way that Stitch in particular sits flat on my shoulder – the Raven is trickier to balance, being weighed down by an internal battery that produces a cawing sound and makes its eyes light up. There is no off switch – to the delight, I’m sure, of anyone who has bought this toy for a child – but the sound effects do stop after a cycle of three caws is complete, if it is left completely still. I set it on the window ledge where it somewhat creepily watches over me – but does at least shut up. Stitch, meanwhile, perches happily on the shoulder of my wife – Lilo and Stitch was a childhood favourite of hers, and she is instantly taken with him (though not, she stresses, enough to leave the house with him on).</p> <h2>Day two</h2>    <p>Having acclimatised to my new soft toy friends in the safety of my home, it is time to take them out and about. First stop: the food shop. Nobody bats an eyelid as I walk to my local Asda – has nobody noticed I have a bright blue alien attached to me? My first interaction is with the shop security guard, whose face splits into a massive grin as soon as he sees me. “How do you have Stitch on you?” he asks. I explain about the magnet. “So cool!” he responds. I get another compliment as I leave the store – from a customer, who, like the security guard, is a young man. “Lilo &amp; Stitch!” he cries out. “That’s sick.”</p> <p>For a moment, I actually feel a tiny bit cool. “It’s only because people love Stitch as a character,” my wife says, dampening my high spirits. If I had been wearing the Raven rather than Stitch, she says, people would just think: “you’re the weirdo with a crow.”</p> <h2>Day three</h2>    <p>The following morning, I decide to test the magnet’s limits and attempt a run with a shoulder pal mascot. It’s hopeless. Anything more than the gentlest of jogs and the toy goes flying – poor Stitch has to be fished out of a number of puddles, and narrowly misses a dip in the canal. Plus, I get a lot of stares. <br><br>My shoulder pals fare much better in the office – admittedly, stranger things have been seen on the Guardian features desk – where they seem to put everyone in a good mood. My colleagues have fun trying them on; the Raven (who is frequently misidentified as a crow) is a particular hit. But when I pop out for a coffee, I find that the bird also has the capacity to give people a fright: “Oh my god, I thought that was real!” exclaims the person behind me in the cafe queue, after the Raven’s caw makes her jump.</p>    <p>The reception continues to be frosty as I wander around King’s Cross, this time with a shoulder pal on each arm (Remy and the Cheshire cat). I try to look as nonchalant and unthreatening as possible, but still people give me a wide berth – only a doughnut seller (once again, a young man!) reacts positively, and asks to try one on.</p> <p>Meeting friends for lunch, I am apprehensive about taking the toys into a restaurant setting, but I needn’t have worried. If the staff notice, they don’t seem to care, despite the Raven cawing throughout the meal. One of my friends brings along someone I haven’t met before, which is humbling – it’s hard to come across as a nice, normal person when you are introduced as the girl with a stripy cat on her shoulder – but my new acquaintance seems to see the funny side. One friend, who works mostly in China, thinks the rise of these toys makes sense, given the popularity of south-east Asian toys and accessories – shoulder pals remind her of <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/14/asia/china-sprout-hair-clips-trend\">China’s 2015 sprout hair clip trend</a>.</p> <h2>Day four</h2>    <p>Pascal the lizard has finally been delivered, and I try to keep it on for most of the day. Though it’s bright green, it doesn’t attract much attention, thanks to being partly covered by my hair. “I thought it was part of your bag,” one colleague says. Mid-afternoon, I end up taking it off – it feels uncomfortable, and seems to be itchier than the others.</p> <p>After work, I head to the pub. The three of us who get there first decide to each wear one of the pals and see how long it takes our other friend to notice. She arrives and heads to the bar without realising – it’s not until she returns with her drink she asks: “Why’s everyone got shit on their shoulders?” A few drinks later and she’s wearing one too.</p> <h2>Day five</h2>    <p>After days wearing the toys around people who have never seen them before, it’s time to meet up with a bona fide Disney fan. I head to Wickford, Essex, to the home of 39-year-old Katherine Potten (AKA <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@happilykatherine\">@happilykatherine</a>) who posts about Disney’s products and theme parks to her 92.4K TikTok followers.</p> <p>Potten instantly identifies my Pascal toy as “a fake” when I show her my collection. That explains why it’s so itchy. She shows me her softer, smaller-eyed Pascal to demonstrate the difference – all of her 23 shoulder pals are the real deal. She bought most of them from the theme parks – videos in which she “hunts” for the latest release in the parks have proved extremely popular. </p> <p>She tells me about “Disneybounding” – the practice of wearing clothes in the colours of a particular character (full costumes aren’t allowed for park-goers aged 14 and over, because that might cause confusion between guests and the staff members dressed as characters). Wearing the shoulder pal that is the sidekick of the character you’re trying to nod to – so, Pascal, if you’re wearing all-lilac in a nod to Rapunzel – “is perfect to finish that off,” she says.</p> <p>Potten hasn’t yet worn her shoulder pals outside of Disney events and the parks, but she does gamely agree to put on Emile from Ratatouille (to match my Remy) and walk to her local high street with me. Nobody pays us much attention until a woman calls out to let us know that Emile has fallen off Potten’s shoulder. Coincidentally, she knows exactly what shoulder pals are, and tells us she has two of her own at home. “They’re lovely, aren’t they?” she says. Who knew all these shoulder pal fans were hiding in plain sight?</p> <h2>Day six</h2>    <p>To get the most brutally honest reaction, there’s only one place to go: to see my family. We’ve planned a weekend in the Cotswolds, the first family trip away for my baby niece. “I hate it,” my brother says when I arrive with the Cheshire cat on my shoulder. His nine-month-old daughter is more keen, pulling Remy’s chef hat towards her mouth. But, then again, that’s her reaction to most objects at the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/02/collectibles-are-taking-over-the-toy-box-but-now-the-grown-ups-are-playing-too\">Collectibles are taking over the toy box – but now the grown-ups are playing too</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Day seven</h2>    <p>For my final shoulder-pal-wearing day, I’m off to the Moreton-in-Marsh country show (when in the Cotswolds …). I offer to push the buggy whenever possible to make the tiny mouse on my shoulder seem less out of place – and my brother, correctly, accuses me of using his daughter as a prop to hide my own shame. I feel more confident after the two young adults staffing the RSPB stall call out to compliment Remy – one of them even says she is going to order one as soon as she gets home. Remy gets a shout out in the food and drink tent, too: “I love your Ratatouille,” a farmer says, as he hands out samples of locally grown apples.</p> <p>I’m relieved when I finally take Remy off. I’ve never felt fully relaxed while wearing a shoulder pal – partly out of self-consciousness, and partly out of concern that it might fall off. But I can’t deny that the responses I’ve had to Remy and his friends have been much more positive than I thought they were going to be. Wearing something so silly and unexpected has invited conversations with strangers, made my friends laugh and created, as Potten puts it, “a little bit of joy in a hard world”.</p>  ",

    "description": "<p>Patrick Vallance says relations must improve and NHS has to reverse decline in drugs investment</p>",
    "content": "<p>The UK is determined to resolve its standoff with the pharmaceutical industry and reverse a 10-year decline in NHS spending on medicines, the science minister has told MPs after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/big-pharma-firms-uk-investment-trump-msd-eli-lilly-astrazeneca\">string of drugmakers cancelled projects worth nearly £2bn</a>.</p> <p>Patrick Vallance, a former executive at drugmaker GSK, said the country needed to increase spending on medicines and reverse a decade of declining investment.</p> <p>“We are determined to solve this,” Lord Vallance told the Commons science committee. “This is not something [where] we’re sitting saying let’s watch the decline of the industry. That’s what’s happened for the past 10 years. We must not do that. We have to act. Now is a pivotal moment … to try to get this right.”</p> <p>MPs called an emergency session in response to last week’s decision by the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">to scrap its plans for a £1bn London research centre</a> and lay off 125 scientists partly based at the capital’s Francis Crick Institute. MSD blamed “the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry”.</p> <p>AstraZeneca announced on Friday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/astrazeneca-pauses-200m-investment-in-cambridge-research-site\">it was putting a £200m new laboratory in Cambridge on hold</a>. It abandoned a £450m investment in its Speke vaccine site in January after months of negotiations, citing a cut in government support.</p>    <p>Vallance, who became a household name as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/patrick-vallance-chris-whitty-best-bits-covid\">chief scientific adviser during the Covid pandemic</a>, told MPs on Tuesday that the NHS’s spending on medicines had been in decline as a proportion of total healthcare spend since 2015, but said the figure would increase from the current 9%.</p> <p>“The reason we need to reverse that direction is not just price,” he said. “It’s about saying we need to make sure that we get rapid uptake of the best new medicines and we have equitable access right across the UK.”</p> <p>He said the UK’s drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which decides which medications will be available on the NHS, needed to be linked.</p> <p>Dr Zubir Ahmed, the new health under-secretary and a Scottish surgeon, said the UK needed to change its pricing models in recognition of new cutting-edge treatments, which are more expensive.</p> <p>“We have to look at medicines in a different light … and calculate the economic and clinical benefit on that basis,” he said.</p> <p>Vallance said the government had not formally restarted talks with the pharmaceutical industry over its medicine pricing mechanism, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">collapsed last month without an agreement</a> and has been cited as one of the factors in drugmakers cancelling projects, but ministers were holding “lots of discussions around the commercial environment in the UK” with companies.</p> <p>“We cannot afford to lose this industry from the UK,” he said. “It’s very important that we have two large global companies. That matters, that it’s two,” he said, referring to AstraZeneca and GSK.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, MPs heard from MSD’s UK head, Ben Lucas, who said it was a “sad day that we’re leaving because we valued our collaboration with the Crick”. The company also plans to close its animal health site in Milton Keynes and transfer the work to Austria.</p> <p>AstraZeneca’s UK president, Tom Keith-Roach, told MPs: “We are involved now in a highly constructive conversation with government at the highest level, notwithstanding that this is an extremely difficult moment in history and a very substantial challenge; the issue of under-investment in medicines has been a continued and worsening trend in the UK.”</p> <p>The head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Richard Torbett, said the UK was losing out to the US, Belgium, Ireland, Singapore and Germany.</p> <p>GSK laid out plans on Wednesday to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and supply chains in the US over the next five years, in an announcement timed to coincide with Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK. This includes $1.2bn of new money to build an AI-powered biologics factory in Pennsylvania that will develop treatments for the lung disease COPD and asthma, as well as cancer.</p> <p>GSK also reaffirmed its commitment to the UK. Its chief executive, Emma Walmsley, said: “Here in the UK, we continue to invest in a significant manufacturing base and more than £1.5bn in R&amp;D every year.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer said GSK’s US investment “will change lives on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>“It’s a powerful example of how UK–US collaboration is driving real-world impact – improving people’s health, creating opportunity and turbocharging growth,” he said.</p>",

He said some users “in some cases or countries” may also be asked to provide ID to verify their age.</p> <p>“We know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff.”</p> <p>How ChatGPT responds to accounts identified as being under 18 will change, Altman said. Graphic sexual content will be blocked. It will be trained to not flirt if asked by under-18 users, or engage in discussions about suicide or self-harm even in a creative writing settling.</p> <p>“And if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation, we will attempt to contact the user’s parents and if unable, will contact the authorities in the case of imminent harm.</p> <p>“These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent with our intentions,” Altman said.</p> <p>OpenAI admitted in August its systems could fall short and it would install stronger guardrails around sensitive content after the family of 16-year-old Californian Adam Raine sued the company after the teen’s death.</p> <p>The family’s lawyer said Adam killed himself after “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, and the family alleges that GPT-4o was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.</p> <p>According to US court filings, ChatGPT allegedly guided Adam on whether his method of taking his own life would work, and also offered to help write a suicide note to his parents.</p> <p>OpenAI previously said it was examining the court filing. The Guardian approached OpenAI for comment.</p> <p>Adam exchanged up to 650 messages a day with ChatGPT, the court filing claims.

    "description": "<p>The second season of this wildly irreverent spinoff of R-rated superhero satire The Boys is packed with swearing, violence – and an astonishing number of penises</p>",
    "content": "<p>Two years after we last joined its troubled teens in their battle against the forces of corporate tyranny, superhero drama Gen V is back for a second series of powerfully bawdy chaos. Release the penis-shaped balloons! Uncork the Château les Norks! But for pity’s sake conduct your celebrations quietly: Godolkin University’s clipboard-clutching new dean is in no mood for frivolity.</p> <p>“Let’s be real,” he drawls during his inaugural campus address. “The previous human administration was full of shit. We can’t trust humankind. And that is why, as your new dean, I will be preparing you for this brave new world,” he continues, as the assembled superheroes-in-training – or “supes”, as they’re called – variously gulp, whoop and clench their bum cheeks.</p> <p>So! New God U, new you. Specifically, new Emma (the wonderful Lizze Broadway), whose relief at her sudden release from the Elmira Adult Rehabilitation Center is tempered by the discovery that her lightly tyranny-padded seat of learning has gone full fascist.</p> <p>A brief recap, then, before we get our Speedos wet. The first series of this wildly irreverent spin-off of the sublime, R-rated superhero satire The Boys ended with Emma and fellow supes Marie, Andre and Jordan being stitched up by Homelander after their discovery of the clandestine, Vought-run medical/torture facility known as the Woods. (Homelander, for those not yet au fait with The Boys, is the psychopathic superhero figurehead of dastardly corporate cabal Vought International. Think, if you can stomach it, Trump in tights.) Got it? Good. And now? Marie (Jaz Sinclair) has escaped from Elmira and is on the run. After a valiant struggle with the powers that be, Andre (Chance Perdomo), alas, was not as fortunate. (Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/30/chance-perdomo-dead-27\">Perdomo’s death in 2024</a>, the decision was made not to recast the role.)</p> <p>Back at Godolkin, Emma and fellow releasee Jordan (London Thor/Derek Luh) are greeted by a grinning wall of suits and forced to read to the press a Vought-approved “victory” speech that turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be rubbish. Jordan, understandably, is suspicious. Not least of Dean Cipher (yes, Cipher), whose densely bearded presence Jordan is convinced they spotted “more than once” at Elmira. “He was a doctor or something,” the bi-gender shapeshifter tells a characteristically open-mouthed Emma. “And now he’s the dean? I mean, who the fuck is this guy?” Who indeed. Facts, discovers Emma, are thin on the ground. “I mean, the name ‘Cipher’ is a little on the nose, honestly …”</p>    <p>Cipher is played by Hamish Linklater, which is in itself a little on the nose, honestly. Is there anyone as adept at extravagant, nay, luxuriant creepiness as Hamish “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/24/midnight-mass-review-netflix-mike-flanagan-haunting-of-hill-house\">Midnight Mass</a>” Linklater? Let us discuss. Actually, let’s not. Let’s just accept that there isn’t. And then allow ourselves a gander at the actor’s spectacularly unnerving MO, albeit from a safe distance (the International Space Station, say; or crouched behind Emma during one of the bits where she suddenly goes big and all her clothes explode off). In addition to his stocks-in-trade (not blinking, being tall, speaking slowly in a sad voice before suddenly blurting out something unconscionable very quickly indeed), this particular Linklater performance comes with a range of Gen V-appropriate accessories. These include a set of ample action-eyebrows and a proclivity for calling those few, brave young supes who disagree with his belief in supe-supremacism “race traitors”. So, y’know, yikes.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, campus unrest begins to mount. Humans are subjected to increasing harassment from the loutish, Cipher-emboldened frat-supes, while hopelessly naive activists scamper around daubing the word “Resist” over posters of Homelander’s spray-tanned fizzog.</p> <p>Elsewhere, as this second series unfurls its cape, it’s a joy and a relief to discover that it is business as usual. There are several outrageous, monocle-fogging set-pieces, including a gratuitous full-frontal male locker room scene complete with prosthetic thunder-dong. (What is it with Gen V and penises? Have 5,000 words on my desk by evensong.) There is an enormous amount of swearing and violence, much sweet-natured navigating of still-unformed teenage belief systems, several mildly confusing references to events in The Boys (the fifth and final season of which arrives next year) and many, many perfect jokes about the endless commodification of mental health and gender identity.</p> <p>But isn’t all this zippiness, this pinging between tones and genres a bit, well … throwaway? Ultimately, yes! But then, aren’t most things these days, when you think about it? Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm. It’s all part of its pinball patchwork of superhero tropes, romance, comic book baddies, thumpingly broad political satire and penises. Oh, so many penises. Enjoy!</p> <p>• Gen V is on Prime Video now.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former Bank chief economist Andy Haldane says left-behind communities need investment to stem populist tide</p>",
    "content": "<p>Defeating far-right populism will require Labour to radically overhaul its “arid” approach to raising living standards in left-behind communities, the former Bank of England chief economist has said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/andy-haldane\">Andy Haldane</a> warned that Labour’s growth plans were failing to support parts of the country where voters feel neglected and disenfranchised.</p> <p>With ministers under pressure to respond to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/14/labour-mps-keir-starmer-no-10-statement-far-right-rally-london\">summer of unrest</a>, he said the “single most important thing” Keir Starmer’s government could do was to rethink its economic approach before the autumn budget.</p> <p>He said: “We need a story of growth that isn’t aridly told from 30,000 feet, but speaks to the lived experience and to the prospects and opportunities of workers in the everyday economy.</p> <p>“A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties – and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p> <p>Calling on the government to devolve more power to regional mayors and prioritise investment in skills, training, transport and affordable housing, Haldane said it was “self evident” that a change in course was required.</p> <p>No governing party since 1983 has seen its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">polling fall so far</a> in its first year in power. Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p> <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p> <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p> <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p> <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p> <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p> <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p> <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p> <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p> <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p> <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p> <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p> <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Human-made global heating caused two in every three heat deaths in Europe during this year’s scorching summer, an early <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/grantham-institute/public/publications/institute-reports-and-analytical-notes/Summer-heat-deaths-in-854-European-cities-more-than-tripled-due-to-climate-change.pdf\">analysis of mortality</a> in 854 big cities has found.</p> <p>Epidemiologists and climate scientists attributed 16,500 out of 24,400 heat deaths from June to August to the extra hot weather brought on by greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The rapid analysis, which relies on established methods but has not yet been submitted for peer review, found climate breakdown made the cities 2.2C hotter on average, greatly increasing the death toll from dangerously warm weather.</p> <p>“The causal chain from fossil fuel burning to rising heat and increased mortality is undeniable,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and a co-author of the report. “If we had not continued to burn fossil fuels over the last decades, most of the estimated 24,400 people in Europe wouldn’t have died this summer.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Kx2pF/1/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing heat-related deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Kx2pF/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The scientists used local relationships between temperature and death to model excess mortality during the hottest months of the year, and compared their results – which cover cities where almost one-third of the European population lives – with a hypothetical world without any climate change.</p> <p>They found the extra heat was responsible for about 68% of the estimated deaths. Older people were hit hardest by punishing temperatures, the study found, with 85% of the dead over the age of 65, and 41% over the age of 85.</p> <p>“The vast majority of heat deaths happen in homes and hospitals, where people with existing health conditions are pushed to their limits,” said Garyfallos Konstantinoudis, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “But heat is rarely mentioned on death certificates.”</p> <p>A handful of victims who died outside were named by local newspapers. Manuel Ariza Serrano, a 77-year-old former councillor in La Rambla, Spain, died after collapsing during a walk in August, according to the town council and former colleagues in the Córdoba region, which had highs of 45C that weekend.</p> <p>Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old father of four who ran a flooring company in northern Italy, died while laying the concrete of a school building near Bologna, where temperatures reached 38C that day. He died two days before a regional order to stop outdoor construction work in the early afternoon was set to take effect.</p> <p>“He called my mother to tell her that he’d come home to prepare lunch,” his 19-year-old son, Salah, told the Italian TV station Antena 3 after his death. “That he’d be home by noon.”</p> <p>Konstantinoudis said the public health risk from heat was still being underestimated, despite the dangers.</p> <p>“No one would expect someone to risk their life working in torrential rain or hurricane winds,” he said. “But dangerous heat is still treated too casually.”</p> <p>Europe’s cities are better prepared to deal with extreme heat than in 2003, when a devastating heatwave killed 70,000 people, but emergency services are struggling to keep pace with rising temperatures and an ageing population.</p> <p>Doctors have called for local action plans when heatwaves hit, more green space in cities – which are hotter than their rural surroundings – and air-conditioning for vulnerable groups, such as residents of retirement homes.</p> <p>Madeleine Thomson, an adaptation expert at Wellcome, a non-profit health group, who was not involved in the study, said the new data showed that “no city in Europe is immune” to deaths from extreme heat.</p> <p>“If we don’t act now, the toll will rise,” she said. “We must urgently phase out fossil fuels and implement policies that protect those most at risk from increasingly deadly heatwaves.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jim Hosking is the wacky deadpan surrealist of indie cinema who has now created another bizarre stoner comedy, a two-hander and a bit lower budget than his earlier works such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/the-greasy-strangler-review-jim-hosking-feature-debut-serial-killer-naked-body-cooking-fat-murders\">The Greasy Strangler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/17/evening-beverly-luff-linn-review-aubrey-plaza-jermaine-clement-jim-hosking-comedy\">An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn</a>. It is like an epic-length Mitchell and Webb sketch in fact, the kind of film you find yourself laughing along to, just a bit, in a spirit of throwing in the towel – a spirit of not quite being able to believe that two actors, mugging and gurning at each other, really are saying these same lines to one other, over and over again.</p> <p>The setting is Mull of Kintyre in 1981, and a pop star called Paul, with a strangely familiar but also entirely ersatz Liverpool accent, is welcoming a visitor, who arrives implausibly by rowing boat through the choppy grey sea. This is a blind Black pop legend called Stevie, who appears nonetheless to be able to see (and derisively imitate) Paul’s quirkiest mannerism whenever he gives it: a perky thumbs-up. (They are played, respectively, by Hosking’s regulars Sky Elobar and Gil Gex.)</p> <p>After a cup of tea, some whisky and a “doobie-woobie”, they have conversations that might be those of two space aliens from separate planets. They seem alternately wary, hostile, and yet finally willing to tolerate and even welcome each other’s existences. This is a relationship which survives going swimming together in the icy sea (are these penile prostheses, incidentally?), dressing up as sheep and saying “Baaaaa!”, and other peculiar adventures.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgUdOCftgKQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qgUdOCftgKQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Is this encounter really going to foment the personal and creative atmosphere in which two great talents are going to create one of the most pro-racial-harmony pop singles in history? Maybe. Never at any time do they get down to the business of talking about this song, or trying out some melodies or lyrics – legal and copyright restraints would otherwise certainly become an issue. But it is funny when Stevie repeatedly and angrily shouts the words “Scottish cottage” in his American accent. Silliness of this purity is rare.</p> <p>• Ebony and Ivory is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.</p>",

To take just two examples: in May, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/hamas-israel-hunger-war-in-gaza\">Israeli finance minister</a>, Bezalel Smotrich, said that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”; <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-said-to-tell-mks-israel-destroying-homes-in-gaza-so-palestinians-have-nowhere-else-to-go-but-outside-the-strip/\">a week later</a>, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza, and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return”.</p> <p>At the beginning of this month, Labour’s deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary, David Lammy, <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49215/documents/262248/default/\">wrote a letter</a> to the chair of the international development committee, Sarah Champion, declaring that “the government has carefully considered the risk of genocide”, and has not concluded that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. How can two bodies come to such different endpoints? The British government has not come to a conclusion on genocide, because if it was to, it would have to face up to its complicity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-launches-ground-offensive-deep-inside-gaza-city\">Israel launches ground offensive deep inside Gaza City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the level of foreign and military policy, the British government works in alignment with the US, Israel’s strongest ally. The UK continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/30/uk-sale-f-35-fighter-jet-parts-israel-lawful-high-court\">supply Israel </a>with crucial components for the F-35 jets incinerating Gaza and its people. <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/revealed-uk-labour-israeli-military-planes-land-gaza\">Israeli planes</a> involved in this bombing have been allowed to land in the UK.

Britain operates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/07/uks-surveillance-flights-over-gaza-raise-questions-on-help-for-israeli-military\">relentless surveillance flights </a>over Gaza. And rather than impose sweeping sanctions, British ministers facilitate trade with <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/688abde61affbf4bedb7b105/israel-trade-and-investment-factsheet-2025-08-01.pdf\">Israel worth £6bn</a> a year.</p> <p>While Israeli president Isaac Herzog – whose genocidal utterances about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/16/the-language-being-used-to-describe-palestinians-is-genocidal\">collective Palestinian guilt</a> were repeated by soldiers on the ground – is awarded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/starmer-and-israeli-president-had-tough-exchanges-over-gaza\">honour of an official visit</a>, hundreds of peaceful protesters holding placards opposing genocide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">have been arrested</a> as though they are dangerous extremists.</p> <p>Every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public. After all, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">seven in 10 British people</a> think it’s likely Israel has committed war crimes, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/04/04/8aa72/1\">a majority</a> supports an arms embargo, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/52694-british-attitudes-to-the-israel-gaza-conflict-july-2025-update\">only a fifth</a> think Israel’s attack on Gaza is justified, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">and over half</a> support Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sanctioning two of the most extreme Israeli ministers – the aforementioned Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – makes no impact on the state’s genocidal war machine, and recognising a Palestinian state amounts to nothing more than a welcome symbolic gesture.</p> <p>The lives of those living in Gaza are deemed less important than maintaining relations with Israel and, by proxy, the US. At the personal level, on Labour’s doorsteps, this approach plays out in the most callous of ways. Dalloul al-Neder is a Palestinian refugee from Gaza, who was a constituent of the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. He got to know her, meeting several times: <a href=\"https://x.com/owenjonesjourno/status/1751706247311524178\">she visited his takeaway shop</a> in 2019 and posed for pictures, declaring “Palestine must be free”. She took him on a tour of parliament. </p>    <p>Within weeks of the genocide beginning, in October 2023, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two young nieces were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Desperate to evacuate his wife and four-month-old daughter – who had been buried under rubble three times by Israeli attacks – he emailed Rayner twice to seek help evacuating his family. He says received no response.</p> <p>In January 2024, he attended a Labour fundraiser in Stockport addressed by Rayner and her colleague, Jonathan Reynolds, and got to his feet, clutching pictures of his dead mother, begging her to support a ceasefire, emotionally declaring “I lost my family in Gaza”. The whole tawdry episode is on camera: he was aggressively ejected from the meeting and on to the street. Rayner did nothing, except to say “thank you, you’ve made your point”. She then unfollowed him on social media. Days later, she was <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/labours-angela-rayner-no-longer-goes-out-because-of-threats-and-was-scared-by-protest-confrontation-13062124\">interviewed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby</a>, who framed the incident as an example of the threats politicians face, linking it to the murder of the MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Since then, so many of Neder’s relatives have been slaughtered by the Israeli state that their names take up three pages of a notebook.</p> <p>Imagine if an Israeli citizen had been aggressively ejected from the fundraiser of a politician they knew well, after clutching photographs of their slaughtered family and begging for the violence to end. Rather than being framed as an example of the dangerous abuse suffered by politicians, the resulting uproar would be splashed on newspapers and lead news bulletins.</p> <p>Our government is shirking away from uncomfortable truths. It denies genocide, because admitting it would mean confessing their own complicity. The truth, as they say, will out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "<p>Take heed from European history: this could be the pretext for the repression of the US president’s political opponents</p>",
    "content": "<p>If 2025 was already shaping up to be the worst year of the century for the post-1945 rules-based world order, the past week has been its most destructive week yet. Israel deepened its disregard for international conventions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/monday-briefing-israels-bombing-of-qatar-threatens-the-fabric-of-gulf-security\">sending 10 fighter jets to Qatar</a>, bombing a Hamas delegation participating in ceasefire talks in Doha. The last meaningful forum for diplomatic negotiation may now have gone up in smoke. </p> <p>At least 19 Russian drones violated Poland’s airspace. For the first time in its history, Nato airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a Nato country. Whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/russian-drone-incursion-poland-nato-ukraine-europe\">the incursion</a> was a technical mishap or deliberate probing by Moscow, as western experts believe, this was “the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said.</p> <p>And then Charlie Kirk, a firebrand conservative activist and close Donald Trump ally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-killing\">was shot dead</a> while addressing college students and Maga supporters at a Utah university. Without evidence of the shooter’s identity or motives, Trump immediately blamed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/sep/10/trump-blames-radical-left-political-violence-for-killing-of-charlie-kirk-video\">those on the radical left</a>,” accusing them of rhetoric “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”</p> <p>Asked how the divided nation could heal after Kirk’s assassination, Trump said he “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">couldn’t care less</a>”. His explanation for that was chilling: “The radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy.” This is how polarisation hardens into tribalism. This is how the spiral of hatred accelerates toward a point of no return.</p> <p>In reality, more than three-quarters of all extremist-related killings in the US over the last 10 years have <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024\">come from rightwing extremists</a>, with the radical left responsible for only a fraction of them. Trump condemned political violence in general the following day – but did not acknowledge the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence\">recent spate of attacks</a> against Democrats, including several killings. To him, the problem is always “them”, never the “wonderful Americans” who make up his base.</p> <p>The political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk’s death will no doubt unfold in the coming weeks, but the biggest danger in a polarised climate is that the shooting becomes the Reichstag fire of our age. That arson attack on<strong> </strong>27 February 1933 marked Germany’s pivot from fragile democracy to outright dictatorship. Hitler, freshly installed as chancellor, seized the moment to extinguish the freedoms of the Weimar constitution – expression, press, association, assembly.</p> <p>“Anyone who stands in our way will be cut down,” <a href=\"https://germanhistorydocs.org/en/nazi-germany-1933-1945/rudolf-diels-head-of-the-prussian-political-police-on-the-reichstag-fire-of-february-27-1933-retrospective-account-1949\">he said</a>, inspecting the arsoned building. Thousands of communists were jailed, including all 81 Communist deputies in parliament. With the left neutralised, the Nazis swiftly consolidated power.</p> <p>In today’s US, Kirk’s death has gripped the country, galvanising the Maga movement and Trump’s supporters, and he knows it. The white supremacist Matt Forney clamoured for the arrest of every Democratic politician, openly claiming the killing as the movement’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-trump-reaction\">Reichstag fire moment</a>.</p>    <p>The reality is that here is the event that could rescue an increasingly unpopular presidency scarred by a sharp drop in employment figures, a weakening dollar, and a housing crisis. Trump mourned Kirk as though he were family, but the rhetoric suggested this would be as much about pursuing Trump’s enemies as justice. Right after the assassination, Trump promised to go after “each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity … including the organisations that fund and support it.” He singled out George Soros, the American-Hungarian philanthropist and Democrat donor. “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-radical-left-healing-charlie-kirk-assassination-rcna231032\">He’s a bad guy</a>,” Trump told NBC News, he “should be put in jail.”</p> <p>The motive behind Kirk’s killing remains unclear. The political views of the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appear as muddled as those of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20 year old who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-shooting\">attempted to assassinate</a> Trump in Pennsylvania. Is this truly the radical left attacking the radical right – or is it the strange, chaotic subculture of online niches spilling into the real world? The slogans <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/bella-ciao-to-owo-what-the-engravings-on-bullets-in-charlie-kirk-case-may-refer-to-13430554\">etched on to the bullet casings</a> in Utah read less like an ideological manifesto than a crude bricolage of puerile memes and gaming references.</p> <p>But it is hard not to fear that the repression of “unwilling” academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants, military officers, and judges in the US will intensify. Already, reactions on social media have led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\">wave of</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\">sackings</a> and US state department officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/christopher-landau-charlie-kirk-foreigners\">have warned foreign nationals</a> not to praise or make light of Kirk’s assassination, instructing consulates to take “appropriate action” against any foreigners who do. </p> <p>Trump has long thrived on chaos and disorder. Where real crises do not exist, he fabricates them – including imagined crime pandemics in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago. Fake chaos fuels his power grab. Now he has been handed chaos on a silver platter. No wonder he couldn’t care less if the nation comes together.</p> <p>The shooting provides the perfect pretext for tightening his grip, silencing dissent, and concentrating power – so that his successors may inherit full state control, regardless of charisma, merit or mandate. After all, any autocratic system has to be built first; once entrenched, it becomes far easier to maintain.</p> <p>Liberal democracy and the rules-based global order are far from perfect, but they have delivered peace, progress and prosperity – the very opposite of authoritarianism. To suggest that the US, the architect of the postwar order, could soon slide into full-blown autocracy, its leaders thinking like Nazis in 1933, may seem far-fetched.</p> <p>But from another vantage point, it is not far-fetched at all. Totalitarianism was still within living memory when many of us, even at the heart of ​modern democratic Europe, were growing up. From Belgium to Bulgaria, most families have some history of the death, destruction, hatred and destitution that authoritarianism leaves behind. If Americans want to save their near future, they may want to consult our recent past.</p> <ul> <li><p>David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

    "description": "<p>Cosying up to Trump is an all-in gamble. Britain should be building better relations with more reliable allies closer to home</p>",
    "content": "<p>Interpreters are not required for visiting US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-agenda-key-takeaways\">heads of state</a>, but that doesn’t mean Donald Trump and Keir Starmer will speak the same language this week. The UK prime minister will practise the art of tactful diplomacy emphasising mutual advantage and historical alliance. Most of the words in that sentence mean nothing to a president who is fluent only in self-interest.</p> <p>Given the likelihood of miscommunication between two men from such different political cultures – the showbiz demagogue and the lawyer technocrat – relations have been remarkably friendly and, in Downing Street’s estimation, fruitful.</p> <p>The contrast in styles has been turned to an advantage. The prime minister’s quiet solicitousness makes no competitive claim on the president’s limelight.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/17/keir-starmer-curious-relationship-trump-ukraine-talks-zelenskyy-russia\">has praised Starmer</a> as a “good man” with a “beautiful accent”. He has agreed trade terms that are marginally less vindictive than the tariff regime applied to the rest of Europe. British lobbying has been instrumental in softening White House disdain for Nato and nudging the president towards scepticism about Vladimir Putin’s motives in Ukraine.</p> <p>Managing the transatlantic relationship is one of the few things Starmer’s shrinking band of loyalists confidently cite as an achievement. Privately, some of the prime minister’s Tory opponents concede the point. But in the restive ranks of the Labour party, and a broad swath of public opinion, Trump is seen as a monster whose flimsy favours are not worth the price in national self-abasement.</p> <p>Anyone hoping the state visit may include some hint of official rebuke for the honoured guest’s authoritarian character will be disappointed. Flattery and regal pomp to secure Britain’s status as Trump’s most esteemed tributary are the whole point.</p> <p>Pre-cooked deals on nuclear and tech cooperation will be unveiled. Awkward differences on foreign policy – Britain’s imminent recognition of a Palestinian state; the US’s continued indulgence of Russian aggression – will not be aired in public.</p> <p>Not by the prime minister, at least. No amount of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/trump-uk-analysis-normal-rules-of-state-visits-do-not-apply\">Foreign Office contingency planning</a> can insure against Trump’s capacity for unscripted sabotage. Even if the personal affection for Starmer is sincere, it is an outlier emotion in a man whose power base throbs with hostility to Labour Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister can only pray that those prejudices don’t surface in some spontaneous televised riff on popular Maga themes – repression of free speech via social-media content regulation; submersion of indigenous white folk in a rising migrant tide. Even if that doesn’t happen, the hazard reveals a flaw in the policy of uncritical intimacy with an inherently unreliable regime.</p> <p>The case for Starmer’s method is that Britain’s economic and security interests are inseparable from US power and will remain so for the foreseeable future. To attempt strategic decoupling out of distaste for an incumbent president would be myopic self-indulgence. Such influence as a junior ally might have over a prickly protector needs to be exercised sparingly in private. The more openly dissenting approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/emmanuel-macron-criticises-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland\">sometimes showcased</a> by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, doesn’t get results. Besides, France is part of the EU. Brexit puts Britain in a different category in Trump’s mind and, it is said, thereby affords unique opportunities.</p> <p>A version of this argument was <a href=\"https://www.ditchley.com/sites/default/files/61st%20Annual%20Lecture%20delivered%20by%20Lord%20Mandelson%20%20-%20transcript.pdf\">set out in a speech</a> by Peter Mandelson, shortly before his dismissal as ambassador to Washington last week. The thrust was that the 21st century will be shaped by superpower rivalry between the US and China. The winner will be the one that dominates in the fields of AI, quantum computing and other such innovations with awesome dual-use military applications. Britain is disproportionately competitive in this field, given its size.</p> <p>In short, the UK is bound by common interests and post-Brexit realpolitik to join Team USA when the only alternative is a world order dictated by the Chinese Communist party. “Like it or not, our US partnership has become indispensable to the functioning of our nation,” said Mandelson.</p> <p>That perspective will continue to shape the government’s foreign policy regardless of who is the ambassador to Washington. It contains some truth about the new technological arms race but, more importantly, it goes with the deep grain of Britain’s postwar Atlanticist bias. It also brushes aside any obligation to work harder at reintegration with the rest of Europe, which is a fiddly multilateral process. It has complex moving parts and a tendency to start awkward conversations about labour migration. Starmer is making incremental progress in his reset of EU relations. Negotiations on agricultural trade, defence and energy cooperation are ongoing. But the mechanics of cosying up to the White House are simpler and the reward in political gratification comes quicker.</p> <p>Trump does deals briskly, but he undoes them just as fast. His word is not a bond. His commitments are conditional. Preferential treatment for British business might be promised, but not delivered, or partly implemented, and one day reversed. The president signed agreements in his first term that count for nothing now. His modus operandi is extortion, the classic protection racket. He inflicts pain – tariffs for foreign governments; lawsuits or bureaucratic harassment for domestic companies – and offers to relieve the suffering in exchange for some commercial advantage. Paying up encourages the bully to come back for more.</p> <p>This is the economic corollary to Trump’s political assault on judicial independence, pluralism and the rule of law. British citizens might not be directly threatened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-national-guard-democratic-run-memphis\">deployment of the national guard</a> to US cities under the guise of law enforcement or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/los-angeles-ice-raids\">paramilitary immigration force</a> that kidnaps people from the streets, but that doesn’t mean the corrosion of democracy in the US has no bearing on UK interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/us-americans-republic-midterm-elections-democrats\">Americans have 400 days to save their democracy | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For one thing, the Maga project provides a template that Nigel Farage is admiring, ready to implement something along the same lines if Reform UK ever form a government. Denying them that opportunity will be easier if arguments against authoritarian nationalism have been rehearsed in advance of the general election campaign.</p> <p>That case should be made in principle, but it applies also to pragmatic calculations of geopolitical influence. Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master. Fealty to the super-potentate across the Atlantic is an all-in gamble. There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p> <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate? What is the probability of an orderly transfer of power away from a ruling party that unites religious fundamentalists, white supremacists, wild-eyed tech-utopian oligarchs and opportunist kleptocrats who cast all opposition in shades of treason?</p> <p>These are not people who humbly surrender power at the ballot box, or even run the risk of fair elections. They are not people on whose values and judgment Britain should be betting its future prosperity or national security.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>New South Wales can expect a late onset to this summer’s potentially deadly bushfire season after a wet winter, according to the Rural Fire Service’s annual outlook.</p> <p>Heavy rains over the past financial year led to higher regrowth and an increased risk of fast-moving grass fires, the outlook released on Wednesday states.</p> <p>At the same time, the NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, has warned that 2024-25’s severe flooding and cyclone events hampered efforts to meet hazard reduction targets, which were expected to be limited further by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/12/sydney-wettest-start-august-decades-could-be-more-rain-spring#:~:text=And%20eight%20months%20into%202025,the%20city's%20wettest%20on%20record.\">wetter than average spring</a>.</p> <p>“With the rain, we see a lot of growth that’s … developed and, as a result of that, as soon as we get some dry hot weather, that grass will start to dry out and become quite easy for burning,” the minister said.</p> <p>The RFS commissioner, Trent Curtin, who took over from outgoing commissioner Rob Rogers in July, said areas burnt in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2025/feb/10/black-summer-after-the-fires-andrew-odwyer-geoffrey-keaton-death-toll-five-years\">2019-20 black summer bushfires</a> were at risk again after six years of regrowth.</p> <p>“We’re expecting fast-running grass fires to occur, that will impact communities, that will potentially threaten lives,” he said.</p> <p>Heavy rain, including one of the state’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/01/winter-weather-analysis-bom-sydney-one-of-wettest-winters-melbourne-drier-than-average\">wettest winters on record</a>, had severely affected hazard reduction burning efforts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Fire agencies completed about 100,000 hectares of hazard reduction in the 2024-25 financial year, Dib told budget estimates this month, less than 27% of the targeted 377,290 hectares. That figure included hazard reductions that could not be completed in previous years.</p> <p>However, Dib said the focused work that was completed could protect about 166,000 properties – or 80% of the properties the RFS hoped to make safe.</p> <p>“It’s … no secret that we haven’t been able to meet all of our targets when it comes to hazard reduction,” Dib told parliament on Wednesday. Fire agencies were targeting 372,700 hectares in 2025-26 to potentially protect 232,600 properties.</p> <p>Hazard reduction – which requires “Goldilocks” levels of heat and dryness – traditionally occurs in autumn, although the RFS now thinks in terms of windows, not seasons.</p> <p>Phil Banks, a volunteer RFS group captain on the far south coast, told Guardian Australia he hoped a recruitment drive this weekend would bolster the numbers of volunteers which dropped below 70,000 in 2024-25. He said the economic climate meant many people were unable to give up a day of work when the right conditions for hazard reduction burns presented.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Banks – a captain of an RFS brigade in the Bega Valley during black summer – said he was cautiously optimistic about the coming bushfire season. Unlike 2019-20, it has not been preceded by drought, he said.</p> <p>“We’ve got moisture and we’ve got water in creeks and dams,” he said. This did mean, however, that some places could be hard to access during fires because “you wouldn’t be able to put a truck on it because the ground is wet”.</p> <p>The RFS urged households to spend <a href=\"https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/news-and-media/get-ready\">this weekend</a> preparing for the coming season, with an emphasis on protecting properties against embers blowing up to 30km ahead of any fire front, the leading cause of property loss during bushfires.</p> <p>While 70% of residents in fire-prone areas had a plan for an emergency, fewer than half took precautions like clearing gutters and maintaining hoses, the service said.</p> <p>Nigel Sargent, brigade captain of the Nelligen RFS, said there was growing anxiety in communities as, with each passing bushfire season, they moved further from “a period where the burn scar has provided a level of protection”.</p> <p>“It’s really hard to tell how bad it will be and how the community is going to respond,” he told Guardian Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/australia-national-climate-risk-assessment-summary-five-key-takeaways-heat-related-deaths-economic-cost-climate-change\">‘Cascading, compounding’: five key takeaways from Australia’s national climate risk assessment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RFS’s advice comes as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/15/millions-of-australians-at-risk-from-rising-sea-levels-and-heat-deaths-could-soar-landmark-climate-report-warns\">landmark national climate risk assessment report</a> warned that no Australian community would escape the climate crisis if global heating continued unabated.</p> <p>David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, said NSW was already experiencing climate “whiplash” between flood and drought. There was the risk of fast-burning grass fires and intense forest fires if the rain “abruptly stops”.</p> <p>“[Grass fires] are some of the most frightening fires because of the speed at which they’re able to move – they can overrun firefighting capacity.</p> <p>“The landscapes that have been burnt [in 2019-20]– if you go into them, they’re incredibly thick. Once they dry out, there are really going to be some big fires.”</p> <p>Bowman said forests around the Blue Mountains, in particular, had recovered quickly.</p> <p>Martin Tebbutt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/14/bilpin-nsw-bushfire-season-blue-mountains-fire-trails-obstructed\">who lives in Bilpin</a>, said the growth in the town was “pretty much the same as it was in 2019”.</p> <p>Tebbutt, who has written to the minister about what he says is a lack of hazard reduction in Bilpin, called for greater investment in mechanical methods, such as slashing undergrowth and clearing vegetation.</p> <p>“It’s wonderful to have all these extra planes and helicopters,” Tebbutt said of the state budget’s allocation of $34.4m over four years for new firefighting aircraft and helicopters. “But fires don’t burn without fuel.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>Pets on jets – it’s happening. From 16 October some owners will be allowed to take their furry friends on Virgin flights between Melbourne and Queensland.</p> <p>In 2021, Australia’s air regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, changed its rules so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/pets-on-planes-australians-may-soon-be-allowed-animals-in-cabins-but-airlines-are-hesitant\">airlines no longer require its explicit permission</a> to carry animals. While other airlines still require pets to travel in the cargo hold, Virgin has led the charge, now allowing them to ride topside, in the cabin. But the national first has raised a lot of questions – from where they will sit, allergies to who picks up the poo – so let’s go through the details.</p>  <h2>Which pets will be allowed?</h2>  <p>Virgin Australia has said the pets in cabin service will be “limited to small cats and dogs”.</p> <p>The animal must go into an approved pet carrier, which must fit under the seat in front. Combined, they cannot weigh more than 8kg.</p> <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>  <p>Travellers wanting their furry friends to join them will have to part with $149 to get those paws onboard. Bookings have to be made 72 hours before takeoff, and owners need to check their pets in with a guest services agent before the flight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <h2>Can everyone take their pet?</h2>  <p>No. The airline has specified there are some guests who are not allowed to take their pet. These include anyone under 18, people travelling alone with an infant, and anyone travelling with an assistance animal.</p> <h2>Do they go through screening?</h2>  <p>Pets will have to be removed from their carrier to go through screening with their owner. There is also a dress code – harnesses and leads with a lot of metal studs? Forget it. Bark collars? Don’t bother. Pets should wear a basic collar or harness, avoiding elaborate clothing or equipment that could delay security processes, the airline has warned.</p> <h2>Where do they sit?</h2>  <p>Only certain rows of seats on certain domestic flights will be eligible for pet owners wanting to use the service.</p> <p>There is to be no sitting on laps, walking of pets down the aisles or taking them to the bathroom.</p> <h2>Is it safe?</h2>  <p>For some, no. While the RSPCA welcomed the news, it warned owners of some breeds they should be cautious before flying with them.</p> <p>“Some pets – such as brachycephalic [flat-faced] breeds like pugs or Persian cats – may be at higher risk of respiratory distress during flights,” a spokesperson for the RSPCA said.</p> <p>“Others may struggle with the noise, confinement, or unfamiliar environments. We strongly encourage guardians to consult their veterinarian to assess their pet’s health and temperament before booking a flight.”</p> <h2>What about allergens?</h2>  <p>On its <a href=\"https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/travel-info/specific-travel/pets/pets-in-cabin/\">pet page</a>, Virgin explains the main sources of allergens from cats and dogs are “from direct contact with the animals, their saliva, and their dander”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/power-bank-fire-plane-risk-lithium-ion-battery-charger-explainer\">Could my power bank start a fire on board a plane? Here are the rules and the risks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the pet will remain in the carrier and aircraft is well ventilated from top to bottom, the risk of dander spreading in the cabin is reduced, the airline says.</p> <p>“With the pet carrier being placed underneath a seat, dander will be carried out of floor-level vents and filtered out, rather than recirculated,” Virgin says.</p> <p>“Therefore, for most guests, being seated a few rows away from pets will greatly reduce the likelihood of an allergen trigger occurring during the flight.”</p> <h2>What if the pet needs the bathroom?</h2>  <p>Pets will go in their carriers and owners are encouraged to bring extra absorbent wipes and a plastic bag to clean it up once the pet is off the plane.</p> <h2>How should you prepare your pet for travel?</h2>  <p>The RSPCA said owners ready to head high in the sky with their furry friends should be prepared.</p> <p>“Guardians should ensure their pet is calm, well-socialised, and comfortable in their travel carrier,” a spokesperson said. “For many animals, the carrier itself can be a source of fear, so gradual, reward-based training is key to helping them feel safe and secure.</p> <p>“RSPCA Australia encourages all pet guardians to begin carrier training early, using positive reinforcement and allowing pets to explore at their own pace. This not only improves the travel experience for pets but also ensures safety and comfort for everyone on board.”</p> <h2>How have pets fared in cabins overseas?</h2>  <p>In many overseas jurisdictions pets have been able to be carried in cabins for a fee for some time, with everything from pigs, miniature horses and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/10/20/daniel-the-emotional-support-duck-takes-his-first-plane-ride-soars-in-popularity/\">ducks</a> spotted on flights in the past.</p> <p>The US has long allowed people to fly with emotional support animals as long as airlines allow it. Passengers have tried to bring a diverse range of creatures on board over the years as they tested the parameters of the rules.</p> <p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/31/not-gonna-fly-emotional-support-peacock-turned-away-by-airline\">a woman was prevented from bringing a peacock</a> on board a United Airlines flight, despite its owner being willing to pay an additional fare for her feathered friend.</p> <p>But the scores of requests for unusual support animals eventually led the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/02/dogs-service-animals-emotional-support-us-airlines\"> US transport department</a> to ban all animals except dogs as service or emotional support animals in December 2020. Non-service animals can be taken on board in the US, with most airlines charging a fee and having limits for small pets only.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/falcons-planes-middle-east/index.html\">Middle Eastern airlines</a> also allow falcons inside cabins and to have their own passports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "description": "<p>This deeply comforting tale of record collecting, magical creatures and a lovingly knitted cardigan rambles across England</p>",
    "content": "<p>Ursula K Le Guin had her Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction; I have my comfy cardigan theory. What Le Guin proposed is that human&nbsp;culture, novels included, didn’t begin with technologies of harm, such as flints and&nbsp;spears, but with items of collection and care, such as the wicker basket or, nowadays, the carrier bag. And so, if we&nbsp;make them that way, novels can be&nbsp;gatherings rather than battles.</p> <p>Tom Cox’s third novel fashions an escape from the dangerous outside world into something soft, comforting and unfashionable. It might once have been a Neanderthal’s armpit, but now it’s more likely to be a cosy cardigan. Or a deeply comforting story.</p> <p>This shambling but intricate yarn of&nbsp;friendship, loyalty, alienation and record collecting features a depressed nature writer called Billy Stackpole, who bears a parodic resemblance to such woodcut-on-the-cover authors as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a> and Tom Cox. His debut was called Will the Stone Circle Be Unbroken: A Journey Around Britain Through Deep Time. Billy is sitting around his hand-forged firebowl when he utters the woeful/hopeful plea: “This sounds weird but I’ve never had a big sloppy cardigan and I wish I did … Just something you can throw on, at a time like this. Maybe in a nice earthy green, a bit mossy.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Within earshot is a magical sea creature capable of passing for a dog, but also of hoovering, gardening and reading Barbara Kingsolver novels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As far as Billy knows, he’s speaking to a group of eight human beings. However, also listening in, incognito, is the novel’s cosiest and most unusual character. How you react now is probably a good indication of whether you’ll like Cox’s affable, quirk-heavy brand of literary knitwear. Because also within earshot of Billy is a long-nosed, sleek-haired magical sea creature with 24 fingers who is capable of passing for a large brown dog, but also of hoovering, gardening, reading Barbara Kingsolver novels, speaking six languages, giving wise life advice, and most excellent knitting. Meet Carl – who, because he’s nice, will secretly knit Billy a cardigan.</p> <p>Carl is one half of a charming odd couple along with Liverpudlian record dealer Eric. Eric and Carl live peripatetically, though they’ve ended up in rural Dorset; and everywhere they go, and whatever mild scrapes they get into, they meet furiously nice people. Everything Will Swallow You is the story of Eric’s life, without and then with his supernatural companion. But it’s also a materially hopeful “state of England” novel. Our social fabric may be fraying, but we’re still warm and woolly, most of the time.</p> <p>Eric’s vocation is nicely chosen. Over the years, his personal fortunes follow those of the long-playing record, and we see it become an index for values of decency and kindness. When vinyl is prized, not just priced, things look up in society. The cynical mid-1990s were a low point, but with gen Z’s fond infatuation with analogue, things have been getting better.</p> <p>One way of reading Cox’s work, from his Stackpolish nature writing in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/27/21st-century-yokel-tom-cox-review\">21st Century Yokel</a> to his recent novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/01/villager-by-tom-cox-review-a-psychedelic-tangle-of-narratives\">Villager</a> and 1983, is as a counter to cartoonish Brexitshire views of the countryside. Look beyond the M25, and there’s folklore, nature, history, yes, but most important of all&nbsp;there are nice people; even if increasingly they spend most of their time looking at phone screens and getting angry with one another. His&nbsp;country, he insists, can still be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving and lovable place.</p> <p>Like vinyl records, England may go&nbsp;through periods of neglect, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nation, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/20/robin-hood-morris-dances-and-ufos-english-folklore-survey-gets-post-brexit-reboot\">folk-nature-history-haunted land</a>, there’s still something warm and ultimately dependable about us. As Eric writes in his notebook, and his words equally apply&nbsp;to comfy-cardigan fiction such as&nbsp;Everything Will Swallow You: “Records never did a lot of what I&nbsp;thought they’d do for me. They didn’t make me cooler or more handsome or&nbsp;help me solve the secret of the universe. But they helped get me through some hard times and taught&nbsp;me that magic is real.”</p> <p>• Everything Will Swallow You by Tom Cox is published by Swift (£16.99).

After five hours of everything from body rolls to voguing with pompoms and a classic cheerleading lift, the excited group gathered round Janecke to <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdgDrgWT/\">make a TikTok</a> of one of the latest South African amapiano dance challenges. They were done in just two takes.</p> \n<p>Janecke has been at the forefront of the growing global popularity of South African dance and music in the past few years. Having worked with Tyla since she was 17, he was responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SgLnflHyQ24\">viral dance</a> that accompanied Water, the breakout hit that propelled the now 23-year-old South African singer and songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/25/its-sunny-with-music-bumping-and-everyone-in-ripped-clothing-how-tyla-set-a-new-pop-mood\">to worldwide fame</a>.</p> \n<p>Janecke now wants to turn his own growing reputation into a global brand, moving beyond the South African music industry while still retaining the essence of his culture.</p> \n<p>“When I speak about my life it makes me emotional to know this is where it’s come to, and that where it’s come to feels like a new start,” he said, after finishing the day’s rehearsal.</p> \n<p>Janecke grew up in Bonteheuwel in Cape Town and then Eldorado Park in Johannesburg, both historically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/10/tyla-racial-identity-south-africans-coloured\">“Coloured”</a> townships. He heard his grandpa playing Madonna and Michael Jackson, and would dance at family events. He initially planned to study accounting after school, but was unable to resist the pull of dance, in which he has never been formally trained.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"91161169-9296-431f-84a4-385d647d3cde\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rCUPVXdVTXA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By 2011, Janecke was exploring femininity in dance and accepted himself as gay. He co-founded V.I.N.T.A.G.E, South Africa’s first male dance crew focused on vogueing and whacking, styles that originated in New York’s ballroom scene in the late 1980s and 1990s.</p> \n<p>The crew, which expanded to include women and a fashion stylist, participated in numerous televised dance competitions. However, it came second in all but the last one it entered, something Janecke blamed on South Africa not yet being ready for the openly LGBTQ+ dancers.</p> \n<p>In 2013, the group was attacked at a minibus taxi rank as they travelled back from performing at Soweto Pride. A mob surrounded their taxi, yelling and rocking the vehicle from side to side, until the conductor finally persuaded them to disperse. “It gave: ‘Yeah girl, this is the end for you,’” recalled Janecke.</p> \n<p>By 2015, V.I.N.T.A.G.E had disbanded, as Janecke started getting booked alone, choreographing the talent show Idols South Africa for six years. He was hired by Tyla’s first manager to train her. “I [felt]: ‘There’s something about this girl.’ I can see it in their eyes,” he said.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward to 2025 and the rehearsal with the cheerleaders – two university squads opening a Red Bull half-court basketball tournament with numbers choreographed by Janecke – was just a few days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/08/vmas-2025-winners-lady-gaga-ariana-grande-sabrina-carpenter-award-ceremony-mtv\">MTV Video Music Awards</a>. Tyla took home Best Afrobeats for Push2Start. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLK2r3sG4lE&amp;list=RDuLK2r3sG4lE&amp;start_radio=1\">video</a> was choreographed <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdgy88qR/\">by Janecke</a>, who was also nominated for best choreography.</p> \n<p>This was the pinnacle of more than two years of working with Tyla internationally on everything from <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/UGFN881mPT4?si=tpN0vj3ypTHd2tTJ\">The Voice finale</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C87O4PZJLoV/?igsh=MWFkZWQwc2owaTZuMQ==\">BET Awards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7503984169244953911\">Coachella</a>. Janecke also choreographed US and UK shows <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKXAjRVCkEs/?igsh=OWNwdndramhjOXhm\">for the DJ Uncle Waffles</a> and taught <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK9-CEFI5iB/?igsh=MWw4ZDdpcmVzdmxhMQ==\">amapiano classes at Ailey Extension</a>, the studio of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater company in New York, and at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7494570271681039622\">Playground in LA</a>.</p> \n<p>“For me, the end of that chapter is the VMA nomination,” Janecke said. He was <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@litchihov/video/7540234973949857032\">on set</a> when he found out he had been nominated: “I immediately burst into tears. I was so emotional, I think I still get emotional, because … I sat up, 3am, to watch the VMAs live. I always knew that this is where my destiny lies.”</p> \n<p>Janecke gesticulated as he spoke, getting up to demonstrate dance moves. “I have to take the right steps to continue expressing and getting this brand out there, away from the names attached to it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80383946-1da3-4402-b95f-e73e5b4c4d92\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDqyaRAHyqA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He listed his ambitions – getting a US agent, working with everyone from Dua Lipa and Doechii to Beyoncé and Madonna, and breaking into the K-pop market, advertising and musicals. He cited Robbie Blue, who choreographed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNi5oEDvlDR/?hl=en\">Gap’s autumn 2025 advert</a> with the girl band Katseye and won the 2025 choreography VMA for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DImV2FOTuum/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">Doechii’s Anxiety video</a>, as being at the level he believes he is capable of achieving.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Janecke was emphatic he would keep working with Tyla: “That’s my girl for life … She’s very passionate about creating music and really changing the dynamic and the conversation of the world.”</p> \n<p>While Janecke expressed frustration that South Africa lacked the intentional and seamless working environment of the US, he said he remained South African to his core. “My African dream got a dance done by the whole world … so, for me, Lee-ché’s dream is an African dream.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>I should have been devastated when I came third in a public speaking competition. But the joy that came out of nowhere has shaped the rest of my life</p>",
    "content": "<p>“I am a teenager, living in an age with war, corruption, discrimination, racism, sexism. But no one seems angry about it. People see the slight advances towards equal society as having solved our issues entirely and it just isn’t enough.”</p> <p>It’s March 2015, and I’ve done it: I’ve solved inequality. Standing in the basement room of Modern Art Oxford for my regional heat of the Articulation prize public speaking competition, I truly believe that I may have just introduced this room full of parents and teachers to the concept of feminism. I’m very pleased with myself.</p> <p>The Articulation prize is a competition for post-GCSE students, aged 16 to 19, who are given 10 minutes to present on a work of art of their choice. I was told about it by my head of sixth form, whose office I had ended up in just weeks before the competition. As a pupil, I was clever but chatty and easily distracted. I felt everything acutely and was frequently overwhelmed and tearful.</p> <p>I also took an all-or-nothing approach to my education: either be the best, or don’t bother. In the office, we discussed my decision to drop history AS-level within weeks of starting because I didn’t think it would be possible for me to finish it with an A. “Not everything is death or glory, Verity,” he implored.</p> <p>Along with my longsuffering art teacher, the head of sixth form recognised that Articulation was exactly the opportunity that I needed – after all, I loved art AS-level, and was suitably gobby as part of the school’s rag-tag debate club. He suggested I prepare something for a preliminary in-school heat. From memory, I don’t think anyone else applied.</p>    <p>I chose to speak about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/damien-hirst-tate-review\">Damien Hirst’s medicine cabinets</a>, which I had seen at his 2012 retrospective at Tate Modern (the poster of which is still stuck on the wall behind my desk). I’d seen Hirst’s work for the first time as a child visiting Ilfracombe, the north Devon town where my grandmother had grown up, and where Hirst had a restaurant, the Quay, full of formaldehyde-imprisoned fish, and wallpaper covered in pills. I loved that his work was funny and contrarian, and that he got away with calling whatever he wanted “art”. I loved that my grandmother hated it. But maybe most of all, I loved that, because the medicine cabinet installations were named after tracks on their 1977 album, I was going to say “Sex” (Pistols) several times during the talk. I truly was the most radical young thinker of my generation.</p> <p>At the regional heat, there were nine other speakers, all of whom had better historical references, made fewer unqualified, sweeping statements, and used the word “bollocks” less. I was awarded third place. As a teenager who put almost all of her self-worth on achievement, this would usually have been a devastating outcome. But, in that moment, the fact that people seemed to enjoy my talk, and had laughed exactly when I had wanted them to, felt enough.</p> <p>By the time Articulation invited me to give my talk again, this time as part of a conference at the British Museum, I had sent in my application to read history of art at Oxford. Before the competition, I had thought I was going to apply for English or German, but certainly not at Oxbridge, where I knew I would never be “the best”. But the competition had emboldened me and made me believe that my opinions were worth sharing, even when I didn’t speak the lingo. I didn’t need to be the best: I just needed to put my spin on things.</p> <p>Talking about art – and finding ways to make people laugh while I do it – quickly became my north star. My Articulation journey came full circle when I was invited back this spring to be the first graduate judge of an Articulation heat.</p> <p>The competition gave me confidence beyond my degree choice: not that I could achieve great things, but that I didn’t have to. I no longer needed to covet perfection; I needed to lean into my own voice. I went from being anxious and easily overcome – passionate but quick to frustration – to someone who believed in their capabilities. I didn’t need to be perfect. For the first time, authenticity meant more to me than flawlessness. </p> <p>I’ll always be grateful to the sixth-form head who made the effort to understand me when I was an obstinate and emotional teenager, rather than simply rolling his eyes (and, looking back, I think an eye roll would have been entirely justified). Not everything <em>was</em> death or glory; I learned that it is often worth trying, even without the promise of “winning”.</p> <p><em>• </em>The History of Art in One Sentence by Verity Babbs is published by Bloomsbury, £14.99.

    "content": "<p>The people of Dysart in central Queensland are used to seeing workers come and go.</p> <p>When news broke that the nearby Saraji South coalmine would be mothballed by November, however, they began preparing to farewell many more.</p> <p>“The closure of a mine is always a concern around here,” baker Toby Teelow says. “Because the town only survives when the mines are open. There’s nothing else in the town. There’s no other sustainable business without the influx of mining.”</p> <p>BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) announced the decision to place the Saraji South coalmine into care and maintenance and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/bhp-queensland-deputy-premier-labels-unaustralian-as-mining-giant-blames-job-cuts-on-coal-royalties-scheme\">slash 750 roles across the state on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>According to the Mining and Energy Union (MEU), most of the BMA jobs cuts will be corporate and support roles, with only 72 of them being coal production jobs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>And other mines in the larger Saraji metallurgical coalmine complex will continue operating.</p> <p>But losing six dozen mining jobs can rock a place like Dysart, which was founded in 1973 to service the burgeoning coal industry. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of about 2,900 people – with a workforce in which more than 41% of worked coalmining. The next biggest sector was labour supply, which amounted to less than 6% of Dysart’s workforce. People living in Dysart were younger, more likely to be male and earn a bit less than double the weekly wage of the average Queenslander.</p> <p>“Here, everyone wears an orange shirt,” Teelow says.</p> <p>Teelow put down the blades of his old profession as a butcher in the southern Queensland city of Toowoomba to pick up the rolling pin more than 800km north after his wife took a job teaching in Dysart about three years ago.</p> <p>It was around that time Saraji South was ramping back up production after having been mothballed for eight years from 2012.</p> <p>“That definitely brought people to the town,” Teelow says. “And more people in town means more business … so, yeah, it [closing] is a bit of a shock. But people around here just keep going on with life”.</p> <p>Another small business owner to move to town in recent years is Hitesh Patel.</p> <p>Patel and his wife run a cafe and pizza shop that employs a friend and five high school students.</p> <p>“Business … it’s OK, but I can’t tell you it’s steady,” Patel says. “Up and down, up and down.”</p> <p>A chef who moved up from Melbourne, Patel says he was already preparing for work to become more sporadic as summer loomed and more mine workers opted to fly in and out.</p> <p>“And this will make it more difficult for us,” he says of the Saraji South mothballing.</p> <p>But as small businesses prepare for a slow down, one shop is bracing for a surge in work: Vinnies. A volunteer at the op shop, who did not want to be named, says every week already brings an influx of unwanted goods – and much of it brand new.</p> <p>“Mondays are exhausting every week,” she says. “It’s overwhelming. Look, this town, they come and go”.</p> <p>The volunteer says the mine closure has been the talk of Dysart for months.</p> <p>“Now that it is out in the open, we don’t know when the influx of more unwanted goods and donations will be coming in,” she says.</p> <p>“Next week? We don’t know.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

The participants of the report had logged incident reports within Cass or contacted HSRs with claims about psychosocial harm.</p> <p>Concerns over staff safety led the HSR officer to send out a Provisional Improvement Notice (Pin) to the Cass dean, Prof Bronwyn Parry, and the cease-work order to staff. </p> <p>A Pin requires the employer to rectify the contraventions within eight days.</p> <p>In an email to staff on Wednesday afternoon, Parry said she acknowledged the psychosocial impacts of the restructure and met the HSR earlier in the day to listen to their “very serious and valid concerns”. She said she had agreed to several “concrete remediations”, including “improved services”.</p> <p>On Monday Parry had a meeting with about 30 senior staff, including research school directors and heads of school, to discuss the future of the school’s change proposal after last week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/11/anu-vice-chancellor-genevieve-bell-resigns-amid-crisis-of-confidence-in-leadership\">exit of the former vice-chancellor Prof Genevieve Bell</a>.</p> <p>The current proposal includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/24/australian-university-course-cuts-jobs\">proposed disestablishment</a> of the Australian National Dictionary Centre, the Centre for European Studies, the Humanities Research Centre and the ANU School of Music.</p> <p>The NTEU, students, the sector’s regulator and politicians have raised concerns about the culture at ANU.</p> <p>Appearing before a Senate inquiry last month, Dr Liz Allen, a prominent academic, alleged through tears that she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/12/academic-labels-julie-bishop-hostile-and-arrogant-at-inquiry-into-leadership-issues-at-anu-ntwnfb\">“bullied into near suicide”</a> while serving on ANU’s university council.</p> <p>The HSR report warned ANU may have failed to meet legislative and policy obligations under a string of regulatory requirements, including the Work Health and Safety Act, its enterprise agreement and staff code of conduct.</p> <p>It referred to reports of self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout and chronic fatigue, warning “immediate intervention” was needed.</p> <p>“Staff are experiencing serious harm … [they] have reported being berated, belittled, and subjected to intimidating behaviours by managers and supervisors,” the report said.</p> <p> “There is currently no safe way to continue with Renew ANU activities without risking catastrophic consequences.”</p> <p>The ACT division secretary of the NTEU, Dr Lachlan Clohesy, said the university had “longstanding cultural issues” that had been exacerbated by Renew ANU.<br><br>“There can be no greater concession that Renew ANU hasn’t worked out than the vice-chancellor who introduced it resigning,” he said.</p> <p>This week, the interim vice-chancellor, Prof Rebekah Brown, wrote to staff confirming she would provide a “draft roadmap” for ANU’s future on Thursday.</p> <p>The chief people officer at ANU, Kate Witenden, said the university was formally reviewing the cease-work order and took the safety of staff “extremely seriously”.</p> <p>Parry said she was “deeply sympathetic” to staff who had experienced distress as a result of the restructure and would be in touch with the student community if the order had impacts on teaching and assessments.</p> <p><em>• In Australia, support is available at <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue</a> on 1300 22 4636, <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> on 13 11 14, and at <a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/\">MensLine</a> on 1300 789 978.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/17/greatest-scorer-initials-xg-most-goals-assists-initials-ga-the-knowledge",
    "description": "<p>Plus: national teams with top-10 scorers in the 21st century, different kits in the same match (2) and a referee’s coin toss</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\"><strong>Mail us</strong></a><strong> with your questions and answers</strong></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p><strong>“Who is the most prolific player with the initials XG?”</strong> asks Oliver Forrest. <strong>“And who has the highest goals and assists of players with the initials GA?”</strong></p> <p>There are only a handful of male* footballers with the initials XG – here is an exhaustive list. The diminutive journeyman Greek midfielder <strong>Xenofon Gittas</strong> scored 17 goals across his club career (plus three for Greece Under-21s) but cannot match the scoring exploits of <strong>Xhevdet Gela</strong>, who is our winner with 44 goals across all competitions including the Europa League with the Finnish sides MyPa and Lahti. Unusually, during a spell between 2019-2022 in which Gela was playing for Ekenäs in Finland, he was also the full-time manager of a fourth-tier side, Esbo, a club around 80km away. Gela returned to the manager’s role at Esbo in January this year, although not in a playing capacity.</p> <p>Details on the former Andorra international defender <strong>Xavier Gil</strong> are sparse, but he never left the Andorran Primera Divisió and it’s fairly safe to assume that he, the Spanish centre-back Xabi Garalde (who made one appearance in Segunda B for Eibar) and the El Salvador international defender <strong>Xavier García</strong> (who did score once for El Salvador against the Cayman Islands in a 2014 World Cup qualifier) did not beat Gela’s total. The China international <strong>Geng Xiaofeng</strong> is possibly the best known footballer on this XG list, but as a goalkeeper did not trouble the scorers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/15/amazon-prime-video-prime-vision-data-champions-league-football\">Amazon to offer Champions League viewers new immersive in-game data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are thousands of footballers worldwide with the initials GA, but if we apply a bit of quality control – counting just players throughout history that have appeared at World Cups – there are two names that stand out. First, the German forward <strong>Gerald Asamoah</strong>, who has 183 goals and assists (113 goals, 70 assists) over a 19-year career, although it should be stated that many of his latter seasons were spent in the lower leagues and the reserve team of Schalke. Our winner, though, is surely <strong>Georgi Asparuhov</strong>. Nicknamed the Artist, Asparuhov scored 150 goals in 247 league games; he was also prolific in continental competition for Levski Sofia, including goals against Eusébio’s Benfica and Nereo Rocco’s Milan, and netted Bulgaria’s first ever World Cup goal in Chile in 1962, aged 19. We do not know how many assists Asparuhov registered, but he scored 188 goals across his career, which was tragically cut short at the age of 28 when he died in a 1971 car crash.</p> <p>Perhaps Asparuhov’s most famous goal was against England at Wembley in December 1968. The striker’s solo run started in his own half, continued with him outrunning the entire England defence and culminated in a neat finish into the bottom left corner. Sir Bobby Charlton later reflected: “Players as gifted as him are not born every day. He was an incredible striker,” and in 1999 Asparuhov was voted Bulgaria’s best ever footballer ahead of Hristo Stoichkov, Bulgaria’s sole Ballon d’Or winner. We can only imagine how many the Artist would have gone on to score. You can read more about Asparuhov <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/06/georgi-asparuhov-bulgaria-tragic-death\">right here</a>.</p> <p>In the Premier League, the highest goals and assists of players with the initials GA is comfortably <strong>Gabby Agbonlahor</strong> with 108 contributions (74 goals, 34 assists).</p> <p><em>* It’s much harder to find historical data for women’s football – but if you have any examples of XG goalscorers, drop us a line</em></p>    <h2><strong>Hungary for goals</strong></h2> <p><strong>“The top 10 goal</strong><strong>scorers for </strong><strong>Hungary</strong><strong> all ended their careers in the 20th century,”</strong> noted Cameron McGlone. <strong>“Which other national teams don’t have a top-10 scorer who has played in the 21st century?”</strong></p> <p>Peter Tomlin has come in clutch with this one, with the short answer to the question being … none. “I’ve looked through every single national team and their player records and I have concluded that there are no other national teams without a top-10 scorer who has played in the 21st century. There are three countries with eight of their top 10 : <strong>Indonesia</strong>, <strong>Malaysia</strong> and <strong>Poland</strong>.</p> <p>“For Indonesia, their third-highest goalscorer – <strong>Bambang Pamungkas</strong>, who scored 38 goals in 86 caps and retired in 2019 – and their fifth-highest scorer <strong>Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto</strong> (33 goals) played in the 21st century. Malaysia’s joint-sixth highest scorer <strong>Safee Sali</strong> scored 23 goals in 76 caps before retiring in 2022 and their eighth-highest, <strong>Safawi Rasid</strong>, is still playing. He has 22 goals in 70 caps.</p> <p>“Poland’s all-time top goalscorer is <strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> who has 86 goals in 160 appearances, with his latest coming in the World Cup qualifier versus Finland this month. The only other 21st-century footballer in the Polish top 10 is <strong>Jakub Blaszczykowski</strong> who is joint-ninth, with 21 goals in 109 games. He retired in 2023.</p> <p>“It could be argued that the national side of Niue have no goalscorers in the 21st century. They have no goalscorers at all as they have only ever played two matches and lost them 0-14 to Tahiti and 0-19 to Papua New Guinea!”</p> <h2><strong>Different kits in the same match (part two)</strong></h2> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/which-teams-have-worn-parts-of-three-different-kits-in-the-same-match\">last week’s leading question</a> on which teams have worn parts of three different kits in the same match, a few more of you have been in touch.</p> <p>“In the infamous <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\">Man</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\">chester United</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\"> ‘grey shirts’ match against Southampton</a>, they didn’t actually wear the full grey kit,” writes Mike Morris. “Instead it was the grey shirt, white shorts from the home kit, and white socks from … well, no kit at all actually. United changed to the third kit in the second half, meaning they wore bits of four separate outfits.”</p>    <p>“When <strong>Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic</strong> beat Accrington Stanley 2-0 in a FA Cup third-round tie at Dean Court on 5 January 1957 they hadn’t realised that in those days when there was a clash of colours it was the home team that had to change their kit. Seemingly Boscombe didn’t have a second strip so someone was urgently despatched to Portsmouth to borrow a set of blue shirts from Pompey, complete with their iconic badge, and that’s what they wore for the game. It must have been a good omen because they embarked on their best ever FA Cup run, beating Wolves and Spurs, before finally falling to Manchester United in the sixth round (by which time they had purchased a set of white shirts).”</p> <p>“Chelsea had a rule from 1964-65 that away teams could not wear the same socks, ie white, as them,” notes Martin Moran. “<strong>Spurs</strong> played at Stamford Bridge many times in all white with yellow socks. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=z5rLjAwzECnrY_b6&amp;v=C7Y5SHSFdJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Here’s a video from 1971</a>. Tottenham’s away kit was all yellow and they only two kits back then.”</p> <p>“Not quite the same thing, but in 2013 when <strong>Barnsley</strong> played Palace at Selhurst Park the referee decided that none of Barnsley’s kit was suitable because of the colours so they had to buy Palace’s yellow away kit at the club shop,” emails Barnsley fan Lee Booids. “I think that Palace charged them for the kit and Barnsley kept their red socks. I remember the Palace fans singing: ‘Are you Palace in disguise?’”</p> <p>“Whilst not an answer to this question, it did remind me of a match I attended where the home side was forced to wear their away kit at home in 1993,” adds Roger Kirby. “<strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong> wore a strip that was specifically commissioned for the Premier League match by sponsors (as it was still a novelty to be on the telly). This strip had very dark blue stripes and Wednesday didn’t take a change kit with them. As a result, Newcastle were required to wear their blue change kit to avoid a clash of striped jerseys. I think the away team should have played skins.”</p> <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>“The 1957 Floodlight Cup final in Germany between Frankfurt and Schalke was decided on the number of corners won (8-6 to Frankfurt) after the tie finished level on aggregate,”</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/which-teams-have-played-in-front-of-fake-fans-or-pumped-in-atmosphere\">wrote Andrew Burrows back in 2020</a>. <strong>“Any other unusual ways of deciding matches or tournaments?”</strong></p> <p>Paul Nash winds the clock back to early in the 1992-93 season and the curiosity that was the Anglo-Italian Cup. “<strong>Bristol Rovers</strong> lost to <strong>West Ham</strong> on a referee’s coin toss!” yelps Paul. “They had finished the English group stage on the same points and same goal difference. Rovers were a heads away from a European tournament with some relatively big names – Reggiana and Bari (who had David Platt playing for them the season before) – and it was made even worse that neighbours Bristol City qualified. Everyone I’ve told in the intervening 30 years doesn’t seem to grasp the magnitude of it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/from-shearer-to-pogba-how-10-british-record-signings-fared-in-the-premier-league\">From Shearer to Pogba: how 10 British record signings fared in the Premier League</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Can you help?</strong></h2> <p>“On 13 September 2025 Andrew Tod scored a hat-trick for Dunfermline v Arbroath,” notes Ian Golightly. “His father, Andy Tod, scored a hat-trick for Dunfermline v Dundee on 1 January 2005. Are there any other examples of a father and son who have both scored a hat-trick for the same club?”</p> <p>“On Saturday there were eight league fixtures in London (Arsenal, Palace, Fulham, West Ham, Brentford, Charlton, Wimbledon, Orient),” writes James Bolle. “This is 19 per cent of the 42 English fixtures taking place that day. Has there ever been a higher proportion of professional fixtures played in one city? And with Spurs, Chelsea and Millwall being the away teams in three of these fixtures, only two out of 13 London teams playing are leaving the capital (QPR and Barnet).

    "content": "<p>Sally Rooney, Deborah Levy, Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux and Pulitzer winner Viet Thanh Nguyen are among 20 authors urging French president Emmanuel Macron to resume a “lifeline” programme for evacuating Palestinian writers, scholars and artists from Gaza.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.programmepause.fr/en/\">Pause</a> programme for writers and artists in emergency situations, as well as a student evacuation programme, were abruptly suspended by the French government at the beginning of August over a Palestinian student’s allegedly antisemitic online remarks, a decision that the letter-writing authors said amounted to a “collective punishment”.</p> <p>“As writers, we urge you to restore this lifeline as soon as possible, and to call on other heads of state to create similar programmes”, says the letter, which was sent to Macron’s office on Friday.</p> <p>Further signatories include Nobel laureates Abdulrazak Gurnah and JMG Le Clézio along with Anne Enright, Leïla Slimani, Madeleine Thien, Édouard Louis, Isabella Hammad, Didier Eribon, Naomi Klein, Max Porter, Alain Damasio, Mathias Énard, Kapka Kassabova, Karim Kattan and Rashid Khalidi.</p> <p>The Pause programme was set up by the French government and the Collège de France in 2017 to help foreign researchers, scientists, intellectuals and artists who find themselves in emergency situations. It has since been used to offer French talent visas and give practical support for people from Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries.</p> <p>Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, a total of 31 Palestinian artists, writers and academics and their families have been sheltered in France through Pause and France’s student evacuation programme.</p> <p>However, on 1 August, foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot announced that “no evacuation of any kind” would continue while authorities were investigating allegedly antisemitic statements shared by a female student who had arrived in France from Gaza in July and was due to start attending classes at Sciences Po Lille University in the autumn.</p> <p>“This suspension of evacuation programmes on the basis of one case of a racist social media post is a form of collective punishment at a time when all signatories to the Genocide Conventions should be doing their utmost to save Palestinians from annihilation and should refuse to be complicit in crimes against humanity”, the appeal to the president says.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/17/scotland-isle-of-mull-restaurants-food-scene",
    "description": "<p>Field-to-fork farmers on the Scottish island are restoring abandoned crofts and serving home-grown produce and freshly caught seafood in their homesteads</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Edible means it won’t kill you – it doesn’t mean it tastes good. This, however, does taste good,” says chef Carla Lamont as she snips off a piece of orpine, a native sedum, in her herb garden. It’s crisp and juicy like a granny smith but tastes more like cucumber. “It’s said to ward off strange people and lightning strikes; but I like strange people.”</p> <p>We’re on a three-hectare (seven-acre) coastal croft on the Hebridean island of Mull. Armed with scissors, Carla is giving me a kitchen garden tour and culinary masterclass – she was a quarter-finalist in Masterchef: The Professionals a few years back. Sweet cicely can be swapped for star anise, she tells me. Lemon verbena she uses in scallop ceviche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-44-zip/giv-32554r2IKoknj43f1/\" data-alt=\"Mull map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-44-zip/giv-32554r2IKoknj43f1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>She points out a barberry bush whose small, sour berries, a Middle Eastern staple, she adds to jewelled rice, and a myrtle bush which, I learn, is different from the bog myrtle growing wild on the croft that, when the leaves are crushed, smells gloriously aromatic with hints of eucalyptus. Bog myrtle also protects your woollens from moths, wards off midges – and is a key ingredient in one of her cocktails.</p> <p>“I had never grown anything before I came here. I was in a kitchen in the city and herbs came dried in a tub. Now, if I haven’t heard of something, I give it a go or thrust it at Jonny and say ‘Greenhouse.’”</p> <p>Carla and Jonny, her husband, are part of a new wave of crofter chefs or field-to-fork farmers spreading across Scotland. Crofting is, essentially, small-scale subsistence farming, the crofter traditionally rearing a few animals and growing vegetables on the smallholding, and maintaining a job or two on the side.</p> <p>Now, just as the architect-designed, off-grid bothy is a world away from the bare-bones huts that once gave shepherds shelter, the croft has been reinvented. Our back-to-the-land yearnings, fuelled by programmes such as This Farming Life and Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild, have turned crofting into a modern rural fantasy.</p>    <p>The new generation of crofters still juggle jobs, but today, that usually involves tourism rather than working for the local laird. For Jonny and Carla, it’s a restaurant called <a href=\"https://ninthwaverestaurant.co.uk/\">Ninth Wave</a> and a cute cabin, the <a href=\"https://www.isleofmullcottages.com/cottage/the-sea-shanty.html\">Sea Shanty</a> (sleeps two from £800 a week).</p> <p>They met 30 years ago when Carla, from Canada, answered an ad for a chef on the neighbouring island of Iona. Jonny’s nickname, Carla smiles, is “the lobster man”. Every day, he hikes two miles cross-country to his small boat, the Sonsie, returning with the catch that Carla cooks in the restaurant. They also cure, smoke and brine seafood and meat on Bruach Mhor croft. When Jonny’s not fishing, he’s working the land.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s not fine dining. It’s street food presented nicely</p> <footer> <cite>Carla Lamont</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They grow about 80% of the fruit and vegetables for the restaurant in their kitchen garden, everything from cardoons to wasabi, and forage for wild herbs on the croft. They’ve counted more than 150 seasonal greens, herbs and edible flowers growing wild here. Bumping up the dirt track for lunch, the hedgerow is billowing with fluffy meadowsweet. “I’ll be harvesting it later for panna cotta,” Carla tells me.</p> <p>“People don’t realise you can eat so many flowers.” The pots of blowsy blooms by the door, it turns out, are also on the menu. “Marigolds are edible and so are dahlias. You can eat the flowers and the tubers. The Mexicans used them as their main starch crop hundreds of years ago. They’re wonderful roasted; like a cross between a potato and a jerusalem artichoke.”</p>    <p>The restaurant was once the barn or bothy, with a dirt floor and tin roof, attached to their one-bedroom cottage. And while the produce for the menu might mainly be locally grown, reared or caught, the inspiration for Carla’s dishes comes from her travels. At the end of each season, the couple head off on food adventures, grazing their way through Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.</p> <p>For lunch I’m tucking into a Mexican-inspired dish: Jonny’s lobster teetering on garden-grown roasted corn salsa, a creamy Yucatan avocado and hoja santo soup, laced with lemon verbena and Vietnamese coriander. “It’s not fine dining,” she shrugs, “it’s street food presented nicely.”</p> <p>At the other end of the island, another restaurant on a croft is also making waves as much for its architectural wow factor as its pasture-to-plate menus. Jeanette Cutlack moved to Mull from Brighton in 2008 and ran a pop-up restaurant for 10 years in her home. Her dream, however, was to restore the abandoned croft and ruined barn down the lane.</p>    <p>With the help of an old university friend, Edward Farleigh-Dastmalchi, who founded London-based architects Fardaa, she began work. <a href=\"https://croft3mull.com/\">Croft 3 </a>is now a destination restaurant, the old steading converted into a pared-back, cathedral-style dining space, open to the rafters with bare plaster walls and vast windows framing sea views; the project won a prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland award. Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir. Starters such as crab arancini and lemon mayonnaise are served alongside spicy haggis, cornbread and salsa verde. Haggis is Jeanette’s speciality and she also runs haggis-making workshops. </p> <p>Now that the land has been cleared, the 20-hectare croft is starting to bear fruit. Jeanette has planted a nectarine tree and kiwi vine. In a polytunnel, she and her family grow salad and herbs while a small flock of Hebridean sheep grazes the hill that is part of the land. Last September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/26/hogget-mutton-good-for-you\">hogget</a> was on the menu for the first time. What they don’t grow or rear themselves, they source from neighbouring crofts and fishers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mull once lagged behind the Hebrides’ culinary powerhouse, Skye, but it’s starting to emerge from its shadow.

Iain and Joyce Hetherington have converted their front room into a restaurant showcasing the local produce – from creel-caught shellfish landed at Croig on the island’s north coast, to organic vegetables grown by Carol Guidicelli on her croft at Langamull, near Croig, along with their in-house smoked venison. On the tiny community-owned island of Ulva, meanwhile, a short boat ride away, the <a href=\"https://www.theboathouseulva.com/\">Boathouse</a>, recently revamped by Banjo Beale, winner of a TV interior design show, has become one of the hottest lunch spots, with diners crammed around picnic tables devouring plates of briny langoustine and crab claws on the water’s edge.</p>    <p>And then there is the well established but ever-evolving award-winning <a href=\"https://isleofmullcheese.co.uk/\">Sgriob-ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheese</a>, just a few minutes’ drive from Tobermory’s pastel-painted waterfront. The Reade family arrived on the island with five cows in the 1980s and rebuilt a rundown dairy operation, starting cheese production a few years later.

After hearing a potted family history, we move on to the milking parlour where he weaves in science and Willy Wonka-style invention. The milk, he explains, is pumped to the cheese-making shed next door via an underground tank. The warm milk, fresh from the cows’ udders, heats the water used by the cafe. Walking us through the cheese-making process, we head underground to the vast cheese cellar, meet newborn calves and piglets and learn about innovative sustainable farming initiatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jul/16/10-of-the-best-island-retreats-off-scotlands-glorious-west-coast\">10 of the best Scottish island escapes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The leftover whey from the cheesemaking was once used to feed the pigs – until they found a better use for it.

    "description": "<p>First feature from director Donncha Gilmore is propelled by charismatic and natural performances by leads Adam Lunnon-Collery and Liath Hannon</p>",
    "content": "<p>This Irish gen Z romance begins so naturally, on Halloween in Dublin where Trinity College students are partying in an abandoned building. Rugby player Jason (Adam Lunnon-Collery) is chatting up aspiring indie film-maker Charlie (Liath Hannon); their conversation is laidback and intense, light-hearted and meaningful, like life. “I’m in character as an arrogant jock,” jokes Jason. We’ve just watched him taking stick in the locker room for having his ears pierced. Now you can practically see his heart thumping in his chest talking to Charlie, who is trans.</p> <p>The pair spend the night drifting through the city; they message a drug dealer (to score fireworks not drugs) and film each other with a Super 8 camera. Nobody hassles them. The movie is gentle and sweet until a sudden reveal – a twist that will require a stiff test of your ability to suspend disbelief, that almost verges on clumsy. But the charisma and lovely naturalism of performances from newcomers Lunnon-Collery and Hannon carries it off. Lunnon-Collery is particularly excellent as Jason, all warmth and charm on the surface.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqK_kT1Gkts\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WqK_kT1Gkts?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And fair play to the script by first-time feature director Donncha Gilmore, which gets more interesting as the film goes on, introducing ideas about regret and the unreliability of memory. Jason gets a jolt to his sense of identity: his certainty in himself as the good guy, a friend to the weak. He experiences a wave of shame over something from his past, events that he has reshaped in his memory to take the sting out. An impressive debut.</p> <p>• Girls &amp; Boys is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas from 19 September.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kaitlin Olson’s turn as an extremely intelligent, glamorous crime-solver isn’t always the most believable. But it’s crowd-pleasing TV that’s slick, easy on the eye and highly watchable</p>",
    "content": "<p>Will we ever grow bored of the savant sleuth? I suspect not – the satisfaction of witnessing a fantastically gifted person crack absurdly complex cases is one of fiction’s most reliable draws. As ever, our screens are swarming with them: in the past year alone we’ve been introduced to Ludwig, David Mitchell’s puzzle-setter turned incredibly astute (if reluctant) detective; been reunited with Natasha Lyonne’s human lie-detector Charlie Cale in Poker Face; and crossed paths once again with brainiac attorney Elsbeth, whose forays into policing are chronicled in the Good Wife spin-off of the same name.</p> <p>Also back for more mental gymnastics is Morgan Gillory, the protagonist of breezy procedural High Potential, which returns for a second season. With an IQ of 160 – giving her “high intellectual potential” (Mensa typically requires a score of about 130) – Morgan’s ability to unravel mind-bendingly complicated sequences of events is downright astonishing. Yet there’s something a little different about this particular clever-clogs crimestopper. Ever since an antisocial drug addict by the name of Sherlock Holmes set the genius detective tone, such characters have usually had a few <em>issues</em>. Ludwig is reclusive, his talents tempered by intense awkwardness. Cale is a chaotic, commitment-phobic outsider partial to a drink or two, while Elsbeth is a no-filter weirdo who gives people the creeps.</p> <p>Morgan – played by Kaitlin Olson (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Hacks) – has no comparable weaknesses. When we first meet her she’s working as a cleaner in the offices of the LAPD. After accidentally knocking over a pile of investigation notes and spotting some serious errors, she leaves a clue behind to point the officers in the right direction. Soon, she’s recruited to work alongside the police, where she duly solves a series of extraordinarily labyrinthine crimes with practically no assistance. Morgan is not just inordinately smart, she’s also a fearless, charismatic, glamorous, gorgeous go-getter with flawless instincts and off-the-charts emotional intelligence. She may be a little<em> </em>pushy at times, but now she’s in the business of saving lives and catching killers, a bit of urgency isn’t exactly inappropriate.</p> <p>If Morgan is practically perfect in every way, the same can’t be said for her life – initially, at least. A single mother of three, she struggles to make ends meet, and mostly uses her mind palace to get the most out of her coupon-assisted supermarket shop. Motherhood can, of course, stymie women’s professional lives, but Morgan’s willingness to put up with the demands and pay of a minimum-wage job doesn’t quite ring true. Similarly hard to buy is the show’s longest narrative thread: underpinning all her disparate cases is Morgan’s determination to track down the father of her eldest child, who disappeared without a trace 15 years ago. Despite her incredible powers of deduction, she hasn’t the foggiest idea where he is.</p>    <p>But High Potential isn’t overly concerned with realism. Made by ABC in the US, this is slick, narcotic network TV. It’s crowd-pleasing and easy on the eye, the sort of thing you’d traditionally associate more with ITV than BBC Two. Morgan’s new colleagues are uniformly nice, two-dimensional guys: suave detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata), investigators Daphne and Oz, plus Lt Selena Soto (Scrubs’ Judy Reyes), possibly the most reasonable and least fearsome police chief in cop drama history. No antiheroes, no edge: the vibe is cosy and heartwarming and rather basic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/23/high-potential-review-kaitlin-olson-disney-plus\">High Potential review – joyous, gorgeous, desperately needed trash TV </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously, the crimes aren’t cosy or heartwarming or basic. The season one finale saw Morgan taunted by a kidnapper who forced her to solve ludicrously difficult puzzles to save the lives of his victims. He returns in the opening double bill here, abducting a young mother on her way home from a night out – but his real target is clearly Morgan, whom he sees as a worthy opponent in his real-life game of chess. Watching her get tantalisingly close to outwitting this man is tense and thrilling, but something this out-there requires a watertight ending. The question is: is High Potential as clever as its protagonist?</p> <p>In a word, no. The show is very good at keeping the suspense going, but it can’t quite stick the landing, and the storyline concludes with a preposterous gotcha. Still, there’s always next time. (In fact, Morgan’s subsequent case – although equally bananas – is better thought through, ending with a neat and surprisingly moving climax.) The quality of the plotting may be a tad inconsistent, but like her many predecessors and peers, this virtuoso citizen detective can always be relied upon to save the day.</p> <p>• High Potential is on Disney+ now.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Good morning. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\">arrived in Britain last night</a>, landing with his wife, Melania, at Stansted airport and then taking a helicopter to central London. But he had an advance party: the mass of Maga political messages that have been picked up and repurposed by some fellow travellers, namely those of the British nationalist right.</p> <p>British politicians have imitated their frankly sexier US cousins for decades, of course. But something distinctive to the Trump era has been particularly apparent in recent months: the borrowing of an inescapably American political style in order to implant it in a political culture that barely knows what to make of it.</p> <p>It’s been visible across the spectrum of the right for a while, from Kemi Badenoch to Tommy Robinson, but it was especially obvious at Saturday’s far-right rally in London, which Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/uk-faces-fight-of-our-times-after-far-right-march-says-keir-starmer\">belatedly said yesterday</a> represents the “fight of our times between patriotic national renewal and decline and toxic division”. Participants wore Maga hats, heard speeches from Elon Musk and Stephen Bannon, and, as Daniel Boffey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-london-transatlantic\">sets out here</a>, paid tribute to the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. For supporters and opponents alike, Trump’s trip to the UK may look like a glimpse of the politics they would like to bring here as well.</p> <p>What’s far less clear is how much all this means to the wider voting public, who may not know their Bannons from their bunions – and whether it is a useful style for political actors whose appeal is based on relentless nativism. As Donald Trump meets the king today, and affirms that his main interest in the UK is as a kind of ossified theme park, today’s newsletter – with the help of Aamna Mohdin – asks what the British right wants from him.

Reform’s promise of Doge-style units to root out council waste. “Woke” supplanting “political correctness”. Tories calling on the government to “release the Mandelson-Epstein files”. Kemi Badenoch and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/02/blue-labour-group-urges-ministers-root-out-dei-win-over-reform-voters\">Blue Labour</a> warning about the dangers of “DEI” instead of “positive discrimination”. Even the assertion that a national flag is a straightforward emblem of patriotism rather than a potentially divisive symbol, a claim with a more plausible lineage in the US, where schoolchildren pledge allegiance to it every day, than it has here.</p> <p>There are myriad recent examples of rightwing political discourse making the trip across the Atlantic and taking up residence in the UK. The strangest thing about it is that very little effort is made to explain the more obscure parts of it to a local audience, or to disguise the unmistakably Trumpy associations in a country where he remains pretty unpopular. So why is the right so attracted to a style that turns so much of the public off?</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The history</strong></p> <p>It would be wrong to suggest that a fascination with American politics is a singularly rightwing phenomenon. “There’s been a magnetic attraction to American politics in Britain for a long time,” said Robert Saunders, a political historian at Queen Mary University of London. “You think of Gordon Brown holidaying in Cape Cod, or the influence Bill Clinton had on Tony Blair.” We might add the enduring liberal obsessions with JFK, Barack Obama and The West Wing.</p> <p>Journalist and author Daniel Trilling told Aamna<strong> </strong>that as recently as last year, “there was an idea that the incoming Keir Starmer Labour government would be the deputy to this revived US liberalism under Joe Biden. The Atlantic alliance was strong again and they were going to sort out Ukraine and the rest of it. So when the political weather in America changes, so it does here.”</p> <p>But those habits were really about strategy, and conversations among political obsessives – not the messages they deliberately shared with the mostly indifferent public. “It has certainly ramped up to a new level recently,” Saunders said. “And that is largely happening on the right.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What’s different now</strong></p> <p>One obvious reason populists, extremists and their imitators look to the US for inspiration is that their politics are further advanced there than anywhere else in the English-speaking world. “American far-rightism is more developed in terms of actually wielding power,” Trilling said. “So it’s not surprising that it influences the development of the far right here and elsewhere.” As Sadiq Khan says in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-londoners-donald-trump-politics\">an opinion piece for the Guardian</a>, Trump has “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.</p> <p>“That’s the most straightforward explanation,” Saunders said. “It’s just a visible and exciting model of success for the right. The Tories are staring into the abyss after the worst defeat in their history; Reform is on the rise, but they still only have five MPs. What this language embodies is what the right can do not just electorally, but culturally – it’s part of a project that’s not just about winning elections, but reshaping the entire landscape.”</p> <p>That nihilist streak is anathema to old-fashioned one-nation conservatives. But that group is now a political irrelevance, and their successors find alliances across the same borders they’re so keen to put on lockdown. “They share online spaces in a way that obviously wasn’t true 20 years ago,” Saunders said. “They are radicalised by the company they keep. And in a very concrete way, Tommy Robinson’s revival is obviously linked to Elon Musk reactivating Robinson’s X account.”</p> <p>All that might point to one reason for adopting a style that is so baffling to so many people: political actors are no longer fighting for a majority, but for the attention of the<strong> </strong>share of the public who will give them the time of day. That engagement is inevitably deepest among the perpetually online.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The political project</strong></p> <p>This is not a merely rhetorical relationship, said Trilling. “There are obvious shared aims between far-right populists in the UK and US. Going back at least to 2016, the big populist upsets of that year: Trump getting elected and the Brexit referendum being won by leave – the key figures behind those knew one another and talked about these things as part of a shared project.</p> <p>“The far-right position then, which is now becoming the mainstream right position, is that globalisation went too far, it ended up weakening our own economies and diluting our national identity through mass immigration, and what’s needed is a restoration and reinforcing of the borders.” Similar trends can be seen in national conservative movements across Europe, whose adherents have picked up the same Maga idioms from <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250417-live-italian-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-meets-trump-white-house\">Italy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/make-europe-great-again-hungary-sets-scene-eu-presidency\">Hungary</a>.</p> <p>Evidence for that shared project was visible in the appearances by Steve Bannon and Musk at Saturday’s rally, as well as JD Vance’s notorious intervention in European politics, and meeting with the AfD leader Alice Weidel, in Munich earlier this year. But it is also apparent in the financial support <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/68486/dark-money-donald-trump-british-right-farage\">flowing from wealthy Trump supporters</a> to rightwing British thinktanks – and which previously funded Tommy Robinson as he sought restoration to the national political stage.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The risks for the right</strong></p> <p>Even if it gets their supporters amped up, there are limits to the utility of this style for the right. “They should be a bit cautious,” Saunders said. “There’s a danger for any nationalist movement in looking like the branch office of a foreign power, and if you look like somebody else’s mini-me, you have a problem.” He pointed to the example of Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, who was eventually interned because of suspicions that his first loyalties were to Germany. “That’s why Farage is so personally important,” Saunders said. “As a recognisably British character who it’s harder to define as a puppet.”</p> <p>Then there’s the question of what policy prescription even those who might give the far right a hearing actually want. “The Maga movement is much more ‘let’s just slash everything away’,” Trilling said. “But in Britain, I don’t think most people, including a lot of those who were at that protest last Saturday, think about their relationship to the state in the same way. Opinion polls do seem to bear out that people in Britain, generally across the political spectrum, tend to favour higher social spending from the government.”</p> <p>The question, then, is whether any branch of the right can yoke the thrill of Trumpy nihilism to a persuasive claim that they care about things like the NHS, in a more authentically British tone of voice. But it remains to be seen whether they can transcend the same thing they deplore in their country: a cosmopolitan, magpie spirit, addicted to aspects of a foreign culture even as they dismiss them.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>After the death of <strong>Robert Redford</strong> (above) at 89, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">Peter Bradshaw pays tribute</a> to a “supremely beautiful movie star” (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-a-life-in-pictures\">life in pictures</a> proves it) who was also “always an outlier”. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>In Knowsley, where <strong>healthy life expectancy</strong> is about 54 years, decades of social and economic decline have transformed one of Labour’s safest seats into what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/labour-safe-seat-reform-constituency-knowsley-liverpool\">Kirsty Major found</a> now feels like one of Reform’s newly minted constituencies. <em><strong>Aamna</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Educators across the world are working in dangerous and febrile conditions.

    "description": "<p>Enzo Maresca’s side return to the site of the club’s first Champions League win but the team face a battle against their former striker</p>",
    "content": "<p>A trip to the Allianz Arena offers Chelsea fond memories of the greatest night in their history, a meeting with two what‑might‑have-beens and a swift reunion with a player desperate to prove they were wrong to let him go.</p> <p>Perhaps Enzo Maresca will be feeling nervous if his team have to face Nicolas Jackson when they open their Champions League campaign against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. There are plenty of examples of loanees coming back to haunt their parent club in the tournament and Jackson will not be short of motivation if he features against Chelsea less than a month since he left on loan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/15/emanuel-emegha-chelsea-fresh-fury-strasbourg-ligue-1\">Emanuel Emegha’s move to Chelsea provokes fresh fury at Strasbourg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The striker has a point to prove, particularly after the drama around his move. It all seemed so simple when Jackson flew to Germany on the morning of 30 August. Bayern had reached an agreement to sign him on loan with an option to buy, only for the situation to change when Liam Delap sustained a hamstring injury against Fulham a few hours later. The deal was off. Delap’s injury was serious and Chelsea did not want to gamble on heading into a busy autumn schedule with João Pedro as their only fit striker.</p> <p>Yet Jackson had no interest in coming back to play second fiddle to João Pedro, who had in effect replaced him after joining from Brighton in June. He remained in Bavaria and was rewarded for his persistence when new negotiations ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/nicolas-jackson-gets-his-wish-after-chelsea-and-bayern-munich-agree-loan-move\">Bayern agreeing to sign</a> the Senegal international, with a €65m (£56m) obligation to buy that will be triggered if he reaches a certain number of appearances.</p> <p>Sense prevailed. Chelsea had little to gain from making an unsettled player stay, especially after previously making clear they were happy to cash in. Jackson would not have been in a good frame of mind if he had flown back to London. The signs had hardly been encouraging during the Club World Cup. A reckless red card moments after coming on during Chelsea’s defeat by Flamengo in the group phase was indicative of Jackson’s mood.</p> <p>It was not a surprise that Maresca’s patience ran out after Jackson’s second dismissal in three games. The question, though, is whether Chelsea have left themselves short. Marc Guiu, recalled from a brief loan at Sunderland, was not on the bench for the draw at Brentford last Saturday. Jackson’s departure leaves a hole with Delap out. Jackson, signed from Villarreal two years ago, was no dud. His finishing was haphazard but he scored 24 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, linked with Cole Palmer and was often a handful for centre-backs. “My perfect No 9 is exactly Nicolas Jackson,” Maresca said in April.</p> <p>It soon transpired that Vincent Kompany was also a fan. Bayern wanted cover for Harry Kane and have found a versatile option. Jackson is capable of shifting wide and played with Kane when he made his debut as a half-time substitute against Hamburg last Saturday.</p>    <p>Becoming more clinical is the obvious target for the 24-year-old. Hopefully he can pay close attention to Kane in training. Bayern, meanwhile, are hoping to tap into Jackson’s knowledge of Chelsea. There has also been talk in Germany of Kompany asking Jackson for tips about Maresca’s tactics and instructions.</p> <p>This is a fixture with an edge. Chelsea’s return to the Champions League after a two-year absence brings them back to the ground where they won it for the first time, stirring memories of when they upset Bayern in their own back yard in 2012. Maresca’s players should not have an inferiority complex. Frank Lampard’s Chelsea were overpowered when they met Hansi Flick’s Bayern in the last 16 five years ago but Maresca’s version travel to Germany as world champions and have invested heavily in their talented young squad.</p> <p>It promises to be an intriguing tactical battle between two Pep Guardiola disciples. It would not be a surprise if Maresca uses the model that flummoxed Paris Saint‑Germain in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double\">Club World Cup final</a>, with Palmer pushing to the right and Reece James joining Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in a powerful midfield. Can Kompany respond? The Belgian won the league in his first season at Bayern but has his doubters in England. Burnley’s sorry Premier League campaign under Kompany is not easily forgotten, though it is worth pointing out that the former Manchester City player has admirers at Chelsea. They have twice considered appointing him: first when they sacked Graham Potter in April 2023, then when they were looking to replace Mauricio Pochettino a year later and ended up going for Maresca.</p> <p>The main concern around Kompany, who joined Bayern a week before Chelsea appointed Maresca, was whether he was flexible enough. Bayern have had no such complaints. They scored 99 league goals last season and will throw a varied attack at Chelsea. Luis Díaz, the former Liverpool winger, is a familiar threat. Michael Olise, who will test Marc Cucurella on the right, is another of the game’s subplots.</p> <p>The winger has had to graft since leaving Chelsea’s academy when he was 14. His journey has not been simple but the 23-year-old has matured and could easily have ended up back at Chelsea. They tried to trigger his release clause at Crystal Palace in 2023 and were beaten to his signature by Bayern a year later.</p> <p>Olise is one who got away. He has thrived at Bayern, providing goals, assists and dazzling trickery. Chelsea will have to be at their best. Kompany, Jackson and Olise will be out to show them what they’re missing.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The push to build a $945m home for the first AFL team in Tasmania has hit a major hurdle, with the proposed stadium condemned by the state’s planning commission as a “monolithic” blot on Hobart’s landscape and cultural heritage.</p> <p>The damning report comes as the state’s premier, Jeremy Rockliff, admitted on Wednesday that the cost of the development had blown out by almost 20%, to $1.13bn.</p> <p>In its final report released this week, the Tasmanian Planning Commission concluded that the benefits of the stadium at Macquarie Point in Hobart were outweighed by its social, environmental and financial costs.</p> <p>Construction of the proposed 23,000-seat venue was scheduled to begin next year, with the Tasmanian Devils’ first game in the new arena due in 2029.</p> <p>The AFL views the Hobart stadium as a non-negotiable condition for Tasmania’s entry into the competition from 2028, but the development has been criticised on multiple fronts.</p> <p>The Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO), located just 170 metres from the site, commissioned two independent acoustic studies. Both warned that without significant mitigation, sound spill and vibration from the stadium could disrupt performances, recordings and filming activities well beyond the stadium’s 2029 opening.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The TSO declined to comment on Wednesday but said in October 2024 that “there’s no precedent in the world that we know of for a concert hall having a 23,000-people stadium 170 metres from its stage”.</p> <p>The Tasmanian RSL has focused on the impact the stadium’s 54-metre-high dome would have on sightlines of the Hobart cenotaph, Australia’s oldest war memorial.</p> <p>Renderings from Cox Architecture show the stadium dome looming over the site, potentially altering the visual experience of Anzac Day dawn services.</p> <p>The commission sided with the RSL, concluding that the adverse effects on the cenotaph, as well as heritage-listed buildings in Hunter Street, the Royal Engineers Building and the general character of Sullivans Cove, were unacceptable.</p> <p>The report warned of “irrevocable and unacceptable adverse impacts” on the surrounding communities and businesses and questioned the stadium’s ability to activate the precinct outside major events.</p> <p>“The panel does not consider that the stadium building will be iconic, as claimed by the [AFL],” the report concluded.</p> <p>On the financial cost, the commission estimated the project would saddle Tasmania with a $1bn debt, rising to $1.8bn over a decade, far exceeding the state government’s pledged contribution of $375m.</p> <p>With both political parties supporting the proposed stadium, its path through the lower house was assured. However, with the release of the commission’s damning report, major push-back is expected in the independent-dominated upper house.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/02/noise-from-new-hobart-afl-stadium-will-ruin-symphony-orchestras-historic-concert-hall-ceo-fears\">‘No precedent in the world’: Hobart concert hall opposes ‘noisy’ AFL stadium being built 170 metres from its stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rockliff said the planning commission’s report “massively underestimated” the social and economic benefits of the stadium, the Tasmanian Devils AFL and AFLW teams and a “supercharged events industry”.</p> <p>“Stadiums are complex, and this is the reason why across the nation special laws are used to approve them, instead of the traditional planning scheme,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>“It is now time for MPs to have their say. As a growing state, reaching for aspiration and opportunity for young people, we must pursue ambitious projects like that at Macquarie Point.</p> <p>“It will create jobs, boost our tourism and hospitality sector, secure world-class entertainment and keep our economy strong. It is time to get on with the job.”</p> <h2>Transport, noise and access issues</h2> <p>The state Labor leader, Josh Willie, said his party maintainted its support for the Tasmanian taskforce report, released in 2020, that outlined the business case for the team and the stadium being based in Hobart. But Willie said the planning commission’s report had raised “significant challenges” that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>“We need to see a response from the government,” he said.</p> <p>“We want to take our time to consider this report, and I think that’s what Tasmanians would expect from us.</p> <p>“The premier has outlined a number of challenges himself today, whether it’s transport, whether it’s noise, whether it’s access. We’ve got concerns around the financing and engineering of this project. I want to see the premier lifting his game. He needs to take Tasmanians on a journey. Clearly, it has been mishandled to this point.”</p> <p>The Greens’ sports spokesperson, Vica Bayley, said that after the commission’s damning findings, the premier should ditch the plan that would see Tasmanians taxed for the next 30 years to service the debt.</p> <p>“The premier can’t keep pretending his deal with the AFL isn’t a dud,” Bayley said on Wednesday.</p> <p>“On the back of this recommendation, he needs to renegotiate it. Tasmanians want AFL and AFLW teams, but not the stadium.</p> <p>“Labor need to rip up the blank cheque they’ve given the Liberals to build this stadium. They must show they’ve listened to Tasmanians and the planning commission, and finally take a stand against this mega-project that is both a budget bomb and risk to Hobart’s unique characteristics.”</p> <p>An AFL spokesperson on Wednesday said the Devils continued “to make great progress”.</p> <p>“More than 210,000 members have signed up and pledged their support, signifying great momentum and backing for the club,” they said in a statement.</p> <p>“A clear component of the licence bid from the Tasmanian taskforce was a new roofed stadium at Macquarie Point with a capacity of at least 23,000. The AFL’s continued position is that this is a condition for the grant of the 19th licence.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

We are not at war with the mining sector. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/12/lnp-denies-using-cover-of-tropical-cyclone-alfred-to-scrap-independent-review-of-mining-lease-objections-ntwnfb\">We are approving leases and mining approvals</a> far more efficiently and quicker,” he said.</p> <p>The Saraji South mine, an open-cut metallurgical coalmine about 300km north-west of Rockhampton, will be put into care and maintenance – effectively in mothballs – in November.</p> <p>The BMA asset president, Adam Lancey, said the mothballing and job cuts were “necessary decisions in the face of the combined impact of the Queensland government’s unsustainable coal royalties and market conditions”.</p> <p>“The simple fact is the Queensland coal industry is approaching a crisis point,” Lancey said.</p> <p>“This is now having real impacts on regional jobs, communities and small businesses.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>But Bleijie dismissed BHP’s argument that the state’s royalties regime was to blame, saying that “care and maintenance is the cyclical nature of mines in Queensland and the coal industry, it’s not new; it’s not a new phenomenon”.</p> <p>“When the company want to invest, they re-establish the mine and they rebuild it with workers,” he said.</p> <p>Bleijie also described BHP’s decision to conduct a strategic review of the BHP FutureFit Academy in Mackay, an educational facility that trains new miners, as “unAustralian”.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands that current students of the academy will be permitted to complete their training even if the review recommends its closure, but Bleijie slammed the decision.</p> <p>“I think that is unAustralian. I think they should keep investing. They have made billions of dollars from the resources owned by Queensland taxpayers and Queenslanders. And they should keep investing in the future of young people who want a job in a mine or resource sector in Queensland,” he said.</p> <p>The Mining and Energy Union (MEU) accused the company of “using coal workers and communities as pawns in its fight with the Queensland government over royalties”.</p> <p>“Coal prices have come back to more normal levels, but to fear-monger about a ‘crisis’ in coal is misleading and frankly shameful behaviour from BHP,” the MEU’s Queensland president, Mitch Hughes, said.</p> <p>“Our high-quality coal belongs to all Queenslanders, not to BHP. If BHP want to focus on other parts of their business, they should get out of the way and let someone else operate these great central Queensland mines.”</p> <p>The mine has been mothballed before, in 2012, and was reopened in 2020. Hughes said BMA has “form in turning this mine on and off to chase high coal prices, with no regard for the community or workforce impact”.</p> <p>The union said most of the 750 jobs being cut at BMA – which claims to be the largest private sector employer in central Queensland – are in corporate and support roles across BHP’s whole Queensland business, including rail, ports and coal, with about 72 coal production jobs affected.</p> <p>Other mines in the larger Saraji metallurgical coalmine complex will continue operating.</p> <p>Ellen Roberts, the national coordinator of community action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said BHP’s continued moves to expand coalmines in central Queensland exposed “the hollowness of the company’s claims that Queensland’s tiered royalties rate is to blame for its decision to sack workers”.</p> <p>“If royalties really were to blame, BHP would not be trying to build three giant new, climate-wrecking coal projects,” she said.</p> <p>The company has several applications for mine expansions before the state government for development assessment, including two at the same Saraji mining complex. If approved they would permit the company to mine about 110m and 33m tonnes of coal respectively, running until 2045 and 2055.</p> <p>“Federal and state governments should not give BHP approval for new coal projects when it is simultaneously mothballing the mines it already operates,” Roberts said.</p> <p>BHP Mitsubishi Alliance is just the latest mining company to complain about royalties.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/21/qld-state-budget-2022-queensland\">Under the scheme</a>, miners pay a 20% royalty for prices above $175 a tonne, 30% for prices above $225 a tonne, and 40% for prices above $300 a tonne, well above comparable states. The scheme raised more than $10bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/13/queensland-state-budget-2023-speech-announced-delivered-by-qld-treasurer-cameron-dick\">for the state budget in a single year</a> at its peak.

    "content": "<p>The New South Wales government has announced major changes to NSW’s planning system in a bid to speed up housing approvals and meet its target to build 377,000 homes by 2029.</p> <p>“Sydney is the second-least affordable city in the world,” the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said as he announced an overhaul of the 50-year-old Environmental Planning and Assessment Act on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Families, young people, downsizers, are all negatively impacted by the myriad maze of planning regulations … and it’s having a massive impact on our economy and our community.</p> <p>“Between 2016 and 2021, Sydney lost twice as many young people between the ages of 30 and 40 as it gained: 35,000 came to Sydney but 70,000 left. This is the next generation of young Australians, the people that we want writing the next chapter in Sydney and NSW’s history.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The state government has been talking to the opposition during the drafting process, but it is not yet clear whether the reforms will have bipartisan support. The devil will be in the details, but here’s what we know so far.</p> <h2>Don’t sweat the small stuff</h2> <p>The proposed reforms will increase the types of projects that don’t require a development application to be approved by councils.</p> <p>NSW already allows “complying developments” – such as two-storey houses, renovations, dual occupancies and townhouses – to be built without formal council approval.</p> <p>Instead, the development must meet detailed specifications set out in a State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp). These include things like setback from the street and height. The development can then get a tick from a council or certifier that it meets the Sepp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/woollahra-train-station-sydney-city-cbd-eastern-suburbs-line\">Plan to finish forgotten Woollahra train station and build 10,000 homes won’t combat Sydney’s affordability crisis, critics say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes announced on Wednesday would allow projects with minor non-compliance issues to be fast-tracked as well. Councils would need to deal with them within 10 days, or they would be deemed to have been approved.</p> <p>The government says it doesn’t want the planning system “to be sweating the small stuff”.</p> <h2>A middle path</h2> <p>The government plans to introduce a “targeted assessment pathway” for development, where strategic planning and community consultation have already taken place.</p> <p>Proposals that have already been through a public process – for example, a precinct design process – won’t have to go through a full development application (DA) if they have already consulted.</p> <h2>A single door for major developments</h2> <p>At the moment, a development like a new housing estate needs to deal with up to 22 state agencies, the government says.</p> <p>Labor wants a single agency – the Development Coordination Agency – to act as a doorway to all approving agencies such as the planning and environment departments, Sydney Water and the Rural Fire Service.</p> <p>Minns said that sometimes agencies imposed contradictory conditions on developments. The premier cited the example of the RFS saying trees should be cleared to deal with bushfire risk, while the planning department insisted on trees for cooling.</p> <p>The government will also enshrine the Housing Delivery Authority in legislation. This means developers can apply to the planning department to take over approval of big housing developments, worth more than $60m, from councils, as state-significant developments.</p> <p>The planning minister, Paul Scully, said this means the state will have a permanent voice in driving housing in NSW. He said the authority had already declared 240 projects state significant since January, which had the potential to deliver 87,000 homes.</p> <h2>New objects and fewer appeals</h2> <p>The objects of the act will be amended to emphasise housing delivery, climate resilience and proportionality as desired outcomes of the planning system.</p> <p>The government says it will also “update” review processes and encourage disputes to be resolved outside of the land and environment court. Details are vague, but Scully suggested this could include a review by a different council officer.</p> <p>Regional planning panels would be abolished. They were introduced to examine “regionally significant developments” so that transport and services kept pace. They were independent of the minister.</p> <p>Local planning panels, which make decisions on behalf of councils, will remain, the government said.</p> <p>The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, says the Coalition will approach the bill in “good faith” and consider it in the party room. </p> <p>“I can’t emphasise enough how pro-housing, how pro-reform we are,” he said on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breaking News\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/sep/17/on-drugs-by-justin-smith-ruiu-review-a-philosophers-guide-to-psychedelics",
    "description": "<p>What if Descartes had melted his brain on acid? Find out in this mind-expanding exploration of drugs and formal philosophy</p>",
    "content": "<p>This book is a trip. Among other things, it copiously details all the drugs that the US-born professor of history and philosophy of&nbsp;science at the Université Paris Cité has ingested. They include psilocybin, LSD, cannabis; quetiapine and Xanax&nbsp;(for anxiety); venlafaxine, Prozac, Lexapro and tricyclics (antidepressants); caffeine (“I have drunk coffee every single day without fail since September 13, 1990”); and, at&nbsp;least for him, the always disappointing alcohol.</p> <p>The really trippy thing, though, is&nbsp;not so much Justin Smith-Ruiu’s descriptions of his drug experiences, but the fact that they’re written by a&nbsp;tough-minded analytic philosopher, one as&nbsp;familiar with AJ Ayer’s Foundations of Empirical Knowledge as Aldous Huxley’s mescaline-inspired The Doors of Perception. Moreover, they’re presented with the aim of melting the minds of his philosophical peers and the rest of us by suggesting that psychedelics dissolve our selves&nbsp;and make us part of cosmic consciousness, thereby rendering us free in the way the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza defined it&nbsp;(paraphrased by Smith-Ruiu as “an agreeable acquiescence in the way one’s own body is moving in the necessary order of things”).</p> <p>The melting metaphor is apt, since the primal scene of early modern western philosophy came when the 17th-century French thinker René Descartes melted a piece of wax. The&nbsp;lump may change its form, smell, length, breadth, and yet, Descartes supposed, we still claim to know that it is the same piece of wax. The knower&nbsp;can be wrong about all their perceptions involving this wax but not, Descartes argued, <em>that</em> they are thinking: this is the basis of his famous “I think therefore I am” – by&nbsp;means of which the French thinker&nbsp;made us the rational, science‑venerating beings we have&nbsp;been ever since.</p> <p>Smith-Ruiu, discombobulatingly, flips the script on the Cartesian thought experiment: what if, instead&nbsp;of melting the wax, Descartes had “melted his mind” with acid, or one of those hallucinogens starting to&nbsp;arrive in Europe across the Atlantic along with potatoes and tobacco, such&nbsp;as peyote or ayahuasca? What&nbsp;if&nbsp;he had not foregrounded rationality and instead extolled the imaginative powers that, Smith-Ruiu&nbsp;suggests, are&nbsp;unleashed by psychedelics? The&nbsp;west might have ended up seeing&nbsp;the world completely differently, and human beings as “infinite reservoirs of&nbsp;light and wisdom”.</p> <p>There’s more in Smith-Ruiu’s psychedelic experience, one might say, than is dreamt of in strait-laced colleagues’ philosophies. His thinking seems kin to such voguish, mind-blowing movements as Markus Gabriel’s new realism, and Timothy Morton’s implosive holism and object-oriented philosophy. Immanuel Kant claimed the transcendent was by definition behind an impenetrable veil, inferable perhaps but never knowable. We could never, in this world, see God. For Smith-Ruiu, psychedelics might help lift that veil. For that thought alone I’m amazed – and cheered – that he got tenure.</p> <p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that this is not one of those gonzo books typed while the author is out of their gourd. Smith-Ruiu is no Hunter S Thompson. It is called On Drugs but it was not written on drugs (apart, presumably, from some of the prescription meds he details above and the odd espresso hit). “I am as I write, sober, lucid, and entirely focused on the task at hand.”</p> <p>The book ends with a remarkable plot twist (philosophical spoiler alert!).&nbsp;In 2023, Smith-Ruiu attended Catholic mass for the first time in 40&nbsp;years at the church next door to his Paris apartment. His claim here is that&nbsp;the psychedelic experience is analogous to&nbsp;that of ritual worship: ordinary time&nbsp;is interpreted as a&nbsp;distortion, and during mass one might perceive, as he did on mushrooms, something like eternity. Another parallel is that one submits one’s will in church as on a psychedelic trip. He writes: “Psychedelics, like religion, like poetry are among other things an abandonment of the will to go it alone.” Smith-Ruiu is&nbsp;self-aware enough to note how absurd this sounds: that psychedelics have become his gateway drug to the&nbsp;Catholic church.</p> <p>And you don’t even need to take magic mushrooms from some geezer in a Dutch head shop (as Smith-Ruiu did) to melt your mind. He cites the opening of Proust’s novel À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when little Marcel dreamily imagines that he has become some of the things he&nbsp;has been reading about before nodding off – a church, a quartet, the&nbsp;rivalry between François I and Charles V – as an example of everyday&nbsp;psychedelia.</p> <p>That isn’t the only non-pharmaceutical way to expand your consciousness – you could try reading this extraordinary book, whose riches I can only hint at in this review.</p> <p>• On Drugs: Psychedelics, Philosophy, and the Nature of Reality by Justin Smith-Ruiu is published by Norton (£22). </p>",

    "description": "<p>From telling the insurers to accepting you may need to get the experts in, tips on dealing with the deceased’s property </p>",
    "content": "<h2><strong>Make it safe</strong></h2> <p>When someone close to you&nbsp;dies, be it a relative or a friend, practical considerations may be far from your mind. But you could quickly find that you have the responsibility of looking after, then clearing out, their home.</p> <p>How their possessions, property and finances will be dealt with should be outlined in the will, if there is one. This should also name who the executor or executors of the estate are – the people legally responsible for carrying out the wishes of the deceased. They will take responsibility for the property.</p> <p>Before the will is read it is important to ensure that it and other important paperwork such as property deeds, insurance documents and bank statements are kept safe if the person’s house or flat is going to be empty.</p> <p>As soon as you can, empty the fridge of perishable food and dispose of plants and flowers from inside the house. Cancel any regular deliveries such as milk and newspapers. Ensure the property is locked up and retrieve any spare keys from hiding places.</p>    <p>If there is no will, the most “entitled” person can apply to be the administrator. This will be the closest living relative, normally the&nbsp;spouse followed by any children over 18.</p> <h2><strong>Tell the insurer</strong></h2> <p>If the property is going to be empty it is important to contact the insurer once the homeowner dies.</p> <p>You may need to provide it with evidence that you are authorised to administer the property such as a death certificate or a lasting power of attorney document.</p> <p>You may have to take extra steps to ensure it is secure, such as draining the water system, checking any burglar alarm is working and keeping the heating to a suitable temperature during the winter.</p> <p>Most standard home insurance policies don’t fully cover properties left empty for more than 30 to 60 consecutive days. If that will be the case, an extension to the policy might be needed to prevent against fire, theft or flooding for example. The cost of this depends on the insurer.</p> <h2><strong>Sort as you go</strong></h2> <p>When you start the clear-out proper, be methodical and put items into categories. The will may say that some items such as jewellery are to be given to specific people, and so you may want to begin by finding these things.</p> <p>Just Clear, a London-based house clearance company, <a href=\"https://justclear.com/blog/04/15/2025/bereavement-house-clearance-guide/#HowLong\">suggests you work from room to room</a> and put items into categories as you go. You could get some cardboard boxes to sort the smaller things into.</p> <p>Some things such as furniture may have to be sold or auctioned off; others may be sent to a charity shop; things that have no use and are not wanted may only be appropriate for the tip. If in doubt about whether an item has any value, look it up online before you sling it in the recycling.</p>    <p>Even if you aren’t able to remove the items from the property, because probate is being dealt with, you can make an inventory of what is there. Once probate is confirmed, you can distribute the items to family members and friends of the&nbsp;deceased.</p> <h2><strong>Pay for help</strong></h2> <p>There are lots of reasons why you may want to get the experts in to do it for you. Clearing out the home of a loved one can be a daunting task, especially if you are dealing with a lifetime of possessions. Or you may live far away and may not be able to manage the whole thing yourself.</p> <p>House clearance firms specialise in taking the responsibility of emptying a home away from family or friends. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/03/treasure-hunters-the-enthralling-emotional-inside-story-of-a-house-clearance\">Brendan O’Shea, the chief executive of Just Clear</a>, says people sometimes think they can do the job themselves but then find they are swamped, or simply do not have the time.</p> <p>“We get calls from Australia, America – all over the world,” he says. Some people are very good at getting their affairs in order, others are very different. It is all down to the individual, O’Shea adds.</p> <p>“I’ve got clients who are prolonging the clearance process because they cannot emotionally deal with it. They can’t process it in their head. And when they do try to approach it, it gives them anxiety,” he says.</p> <p>Typically, a professional house clearance service should clear the property, taking over the sorting and recycling and, in some cases, moving items to an auction house. It may also sell items on your behalf, taking a commission in the&nbsp;process. You may also be able&nbsp;to&nbsp;get it to take care of cleaning&nbsp;of the property, too, if this&nbsp;is needed.</p>    <p>O’Shea says that an average three-bedroom house – in which one person was living – will take his company a day to clear. This would cost the estate £1,700 (plus VAT) and includes recycling charges, and haulage and labour, among other&nbsp;expenses.</p> <p>In some cases, the clearance turns up valuable items that loved ones did not know were there. O’Shea says his company found two Picasso ceramics in a house in Knightsbridge, London – they subsequently sold for £120,000.</p> <p>For those who believe that items in a home are worth more than they are, he says that auctioning them will show what the market values them at.He says an auction is a good way of finding out how much something is worth. You may think something is a valuable antique, but by taking it to an auction you can find out how much the market will pay for it.</p> <p>He says the low bar for entry to become a clearance company means it “is not a nice industry”. In order to distinguish between companies, look at online reviews for them and how long they have been in the&nbsp;business. Recommendations from local friends or relatives will also help you choose a good company.</p> <h2><strong>Inform organisations</strong></h2> <p>Some organisations will need to be told of the death. Many councils use the Tell Us Once system, which notifies most government organisations in one go. The registrar will give you the details and a number when you register the death. The system will tell HM Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Passport Office and the DVLA among others. You will need the personal details of the deceased, and possibly documents such as passport and driving licence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and optician</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/money-legal/legal-issues/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/\">Age UK</a> says if the council is not part of the service, you will have to contact the organisations yourself. The name of deceased can be put on the Bereavement Register, which removes them from mailing lists and stops advertising mail.</p> <p>You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and optician, as well as any charities to which they may have made subscription payments.</p> <h2><strong>Don’t rush</strong></h2> <p>Dealing with the death of a friend or a loved one does not have to be rushed. The insurer <a href=\"https://www.legalandgeneral.com/insurance/over-50-life-insurance/funeral-planning/clearing-a-house-after-death/\">L&amp;G advises people</a> to clear out a home with someone else and to do it over different days in order to avoid emotional fatigue. Just Clear says it&nbsp;can often take several weeks to sort through the remains of someone’s life and it is vital to give yourself time to reflect.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/bereavement-help-and-support\">Charities are available to help</a>. Cruse Bereavement Support has helplines to help those who have lost someone, while Marie Curie also has a helpline. <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/death-and-wills/dealing-with-the-financial-affairs-of-someone-who-has-died/\">Citizens Advice has advice</a> on the steps that need to be taken after a death.</p>",

For partnered pensioners, the payment will increase $21.40 to $813.90 each a fortnight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>For singles over 22, jobseeker payments will increase by $12.50 a fortnight, to a total of $793.60.</p> <p>You can check the full list off payments and increases on the <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/income-support-payments/resource/indexation-rates-september-2025\">Services Australia website.</a></p> <h2>Is it enough?</h2>  <p>The social services minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Australia’s welfare system was “ground in fairness”, which is why it is indexed.</p> <p>“Thanks to indexation, millions of Aussies will receive a boost to their payment to help them cover everyday costs like groceries and healthcare,” she said. “The government wants to help take the pressure off when it comes to cost of living.”</p> <p>But anti-poverty advocates argue the small rise in benefits will do little to help elevate the financial struggle millions of Australians are facing, calling for payments to be lifted in line with the Henderson poverty line of $660.72 a week for a single person.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/01/1-july-changes-2025-centrelink-payments-minimum-wage-road-fines-everything-financial-year\">1 July changes: minimum wage, Centrelink payments, parental leave, road fines and everything else coming for the 2025-26 financial year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welfare advocate Jeremy Poxon said CPI indexation does little to help “people in poverty”.</p> <p>“Politicians on both sides boast about indexation to pretend they’re doing something to boost people’s income,” Poxon said.</p> <p>“This is a deeply cynical and insulting exercise, designed to hide the fact that, in reality, government is starving the poor with some of the lowest welfare payments in the OECD.”</p> <h2>What’s happening with the deeming rate?</h2>  <p>The government uses deeming rates to calculate how much money pensioners make from their financial assets after they have retired. This is used to help determine how much their fortnightly pension will be.</p> <p>The lower the deeming rate, the more people can earn from their investments – shares, superannuation and any interest on money in the bank – without it affecting their payments.</p> <p>Deeming rates were cut in Covid, and have been paused ever since, but as part of a push to return them to pre-pandemic figures they will be increasing.</p> <p>“As Australians begin to feel the positive impacts of inflation easing, the government will now gradually return deeming rates to pre-pandemic settings,” a media release from Plibersek said in August.</p> <p>“From 20 September, a deeming rate of 0.75% will apply to financial assets under $64,200 for singles and $106,200 for couples combined. Assets over this amount will be deemed at a rate of 2.75%.</p> <p>“Even with these increases, the deeming rates will remain below historical pre-Covid averages.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<h2>Doc</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Witness</strong></p> <p>While we wait for the US smash The Pitt to reach UK screens, here’s a new medical drama starring Molly Parker as a doctor who suffers amnesia. After a car crash, Dr Amy Larsen forgets everything that happened in the last eight years of her life … including her divorce. She relies on her colleagues (some of whom she has crossed) and teenage daughter (whom she remembers as a nine-year-old) to help fill in the blanks – the good and the bad. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Stranded on Honeymoon Island</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Pour yourself a stiff one for week three of the Philippines-set reality show that takes two shots of Married at First Sight and mixes it with a glug of Love Island to create a sun-drenched but volatile cocktail. The latest wheeze to mess with the various newlyweds is to speedboat in some of their exes – a sure way to stir things up. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Madeleine McCann: Searching for the Prime Suspect</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>It has now been 18 years since Madeleine McCann’s unsolved disappearance but the public hunger for answers remains the same. This documentary focuses on Christian Brückner, who is set to be released from prison with no new charges despite the suspicions of the German authorities. But why can’t they prove anything? <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Donald Trump Show</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>While this series – which uses recent news footage, edited narratively without any voiceover – treats the second Trump presidency as an unfolding drama, its implications are very real and as serious as your life. This time, his willingness to ignore democratic norms extends to sending the National Guard to patrol LA and Washington DC. Terrifying. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Rumour</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong></p> <p>Who is the real Sally McGowan? For all our sakes, let’s hope that Joanna’s obsession finally finds her the answer as the juicy thriller concludes. Her husband starts to worry about her behaviour and she is fired from work, but Joanna (Rachel Shenton) remains undeterred in her quest. It concludes on Thursday. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Mudtown</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Alibi</strong></p> <p>The penultimate episode of this dark Welsh drama sees Claire (Erin Richards) learn some home truths from “the Tony Soprano of Newport”. But if anything’s going to make you uneasy, it may be the sight of Matthew Gravelle – AKA Broadchurch baddie Joe Miller – as a doting dad. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, </strong><strong>9pm, Film4</strong></p>    <p>Soon-to-be national treasure Emma Thompson gives a wonderfully candid performance in Sophie Hyde’s poignant drama about a late-in-life sexual awakening. Her widowed, retired teacher Nancy hires “aesthetically perfect” sex worker Leo (Daryl McCormack) for an afternoon in a hotel room in the hope of discovering a physical pleasure she never knew during her long marriage. There’s much more talking than sex, but the two leads perfectly balance the awkwardness, humour, tension and emotional mic drops that characterise their transactional encounters. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2>Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League Football: </strong><strong>Liverpool v Atlético Madrid, </strong><strong>7pm, TNT Sports 1 </strong>Bayern Munich v Chelsea is on TNT Sports 2.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The “too old, too slow” slight is as old as football. In the AFL era, Hawthorn in 1991 and Geelong in 2011 both played like they were insulted at the idea of being pensioned off. But by today’s standards, the age composition of those two premiership teams shouldn’t have been cause for concern. Michael Tuck was 38 but it felt like he’d been 38 since the early 1980s. Chris Mew was 30 and Gary Ayres turned 31 on grand final day. Within six months of that game, Dermott Brereton’s body was shot to bits. But he was still only 27. Similarly, the Geelong side of 2011 wasn’t the dad’s army that they’re sometimes remembered as, with only five 30 or older and Matthew Scarlett the oldest at 32.</p> <p>The Collingwood team that will run out in the preliminary final really is old. If Jeremy Howe plays, he’ll be the ninth player who is 30 or over. Two more, Jordan De Goey and Darcy Moore, will soon join them. It’s a trend we’re seeing in all sports. Tom Brady retired at 45. Novak Djokovic won a dozen grand slams in his 30s. Serena Williams won nine, including an Australian Open at 35 when she was pregnant.</p> <p>The truly solar stars – Brady, Djokovic, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kyrie Irving, Kelly Slater and Aaron Rodgers – are often fanatical about nutrition, sleep, supplementation and pesky little things like vaccines. Mason Cox (34), with the greatest respect, is no Ronaldo. And Brody Mihocek (held together by masking tape at 32) doesn’t move like Djokovic. But it’s worth looking at what Collingwood is doing here. Is it simply a case of having one last throw at the stumps before a glut of retirements? Are they trained differently to players at other clubs? And do the daily habits of their oldest players rub off on everyone else?</p>    <p>The role Collingwood’s high-performance manager has played in prolonging so many careers cannot be underestimated. Jarrod Wade arrived at Collingwood two weeks after Craig McRae. He’d been working in rugby league for more than half a decade and he was adamant that AFL players weren’t physically resilient enough. He often quoted Wayne Bennett: “You don’t have to feel good to train good.” This was at odds with the conditioning mentality at many clubs, who’d often be hyper-cautious with sore players, especially older ones. Many were shocked by the volume and intensity of his first preseason. But he was more than some old school sadist throwing eggs at the wall and persisting with the ones that didn’t break. He had the right blend of data and intuition. Crucially, he had a core group of self-driven, physically and mentally resilient senior players who ate up the hard work. By halfway through the following season, they were mowing teams down in final quarters.</p> <p>More than anything, he had Scott Pendlebury. Earlier this year, the 37-year-old did a podcast with Mark Howard, an off-season-in-the-life type arrangement that provided some insights into why he’s so durable and so good. When he wasn’t in the sauna, he was having an afternoon nap. When he wasn’t doing cold plunges, he was doing mobility exercises. You can’t help but wonder how many professional athletes, especially 37-year-old fathers, could adhere to that kind of regime.</p> <p>But Pendlebury relishes it. One of Novak’s former coaches referred to the tennis player’s “continuity of obsession”. Like the Serbian champion, the overwhelming impression was that none of this was a chore for Pendlebury, that he loved optimising every hour, every calorie and every kilometre.</p>    <p>Listening to a man itemise his hot/cold routine is just about the most boring thing a grown adult can do. But it’s the tedious, meticulous stuff in late October that allows him the full expression of his game in September. And it’s a joy to watch him play in moments like that – to watch him conducting a game, to watch him compute and solve the game’s problems, and to navigate its chokepoints. The similarly ageless Patrick Dangerfield leaves divots, bruises and trauma. Pendlebury doesn’t leave a trace. He hovers above the game, popping in where he sees fit, like a cat hopping on a lap.</p> <p>A few days before the 2023 grand final, he did a podcast with the journalist Jay Clark and Ross Lyon. Just sitting in a chair and sipping from a water bottle, he radiated the kind of energy you often see in experienced, emotionally regulated athletes on the eve of competition. He looked like a man who’s spent the past six months sauna-ing, cold-plunging and analysing stoppages. He looked like the least likely footballer imaginable to play the game in his head before he ran out.</p> <p>Lyon saw it too. “You look like a title fighter,” he laughed. “Lean, dog hungry, ready to go.” That’s Pendlebury and that’s Collingwood right now – hungry, wily and yes, old, a team raging against the dying of the light.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from Guardian Australia’s free weekly AFL email, From the Pocket. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">To get the full version, just visit this page and follow the instructions</a></strong></em></p></li> </ul>",

The Guardian will eliminate two-thirds of its emissions by 2030 and reduce our impact on nature</strong></h2> \n<p>Since 2020, our company greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 48%, putting us well on track to achieve our target of a 67% reduction by 2030. In the last reporting year, emissions fell by 9%.</p> \n<p>The biggest reductions so far in our plan have come from our print business, which now accounts for 64% of our total footprint, compared with 73% in 2020. As our business becomes more digital and more global, emissions from our digital products, IT operations and business travel will account for a larger proportion of emissions.</p> \n<p>We are committed to reducing all areas of our footprint, which is why we have developed a bespoke climate literacy course for our staff to empower all colleagues to take action in their area of the business.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. We will seek to decouple our business and finances from fossil-fuel extractive companies</strong></h2> \n<p>The Guardian has refused advertising from all fossil-fuel extractive companies since January 2020.</p> \n<p>The Guardian is supported by the Scott Trust and the returns from its endowment fund. The fund’s environmental strategy is focused on contributing to a reduction of emissions in the real world and to protecting nature and biodiversity. The fund has made significant investments in environmental solutions, with more than £100m now invested in areas ranging from cutting emissions in manufacturing processes to increasing the resilience of food systems in a warming world. Additionally, the fund has made a commitment to invest at least 3% of its value in natural capital and biodiversity solutions.</p> \n<p>The endowment’s environmental focus builds on work started in 2015 to divest from fossil fuels.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. We will be transparent with our progress</strong></h2> \n<p>We believe transparency is the key to tackling the climate crisis. By sharing our data, our successes and our challenges, we can be part of the global movement to make businesses accountable for their climate and nature impacts.</p> \n<p>In the past year we have:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Published <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/10/24/Sustainability_Report_2023.pdf\">our annual company emissions data</a>, explaining what drives our emissions and where they have risen and fallen</p></li> \n <li><p>Created a digital course, as part of an initiative by the <a href=\"https://sustainablejournalism.net/\">Sustainable Journalism Partnership</a>, sharing examples from experts across the Guardian of how to embed sustainability into journalism and media commercial operations</p></li> \n <li><p>Contributed our time and knowledge to working groups in the advertising industry that are working on better ways to measure the emissions impact of advertising</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>We open ourselves up to scrutiny by independent third parties, such as the <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/\">Science-Based Targets initiative</a> (SBTi) and B Corp, so they can assess the robustness of our targets and our internal policies.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After a cyber-attack rained on its summer, Marks &amp; Spencer is banking on fashion to brighten its autumn.</p> <p>A Prada-esque, crystal-embellished, charcoal V-neck cardigan (£46), a faux leather trenchcoat with a price tag of £90 – £6,810 less than the Burberry version – and a £36 short pleated skirt that offers a wearable take on Charli xcx’s “brat” styling will hit shop floors shortly.</p> <p>“We can be bolder because, while we continue to dominate in the over-55s, we’ve got new customers in the 35- to 55-year-old age range,” said Maddy Evans, the brand’s womenswear lead, at a showcase of the new collection in the run-up to London fashion week, which begins on Friday.</p>    <p>The store is relying on womenswear, which has been ticking upward in sales and credibility for two years, to lead a bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a devastating cyber-attack</a> that affected M&amp;S from April to August and is predicted to have cost the business £300m in profits.</p> <p>Evans said the retailer was aiming for two-thirds newness in store. “That basically means that if a customer walks in to see the new season, two-thirds of it she will never have seen before. The other third is core product – white T-shirts, skinny jeans, black wide-leg trousers, pieces that never go out of stock.”</p> <p>M&amp;S “sense-checked” trends for wearability, Evans added. The return of the miniskirt, as widely seen on city streets this summer, is reflected at the retailer, but “never unwearably short”. “We are shifting out of the midi skirt into shorter lengths, but our customer trusts us to make a short skirt that they feel good in,” she added.</p> <p>The head of womenswear design, Lisa Illis, said knowing which trends to ignore was as important as knowing which to pick up on. Waving to a rail of tonal rose, burgundy and chocolate knitwear, she said: “We avoid harder, sharper colours that are more difficult to wear, in favour of these flattering shades.”</p> <p>Leather – real and faux – features on coats, minidresses and skirts as well as shoes. The store had a hit at the beginning of this year, selling 20,000 pairs of £55 loafers, which offered an affordable take on the key shoe of the “quiet luxury” era. Investment in loafers has been ramped up by 40% for the coming winter.</p> <p>In denim – where high-waisted styles rule – the under-£30 price point remains key, “although we’re seeing more opportunity at £45-£49, when the product is right”.</p> <p>To respond more nimbly to demand, the company has substantially shifted production from China, Vietnam and Cambodia to “nearshore” manufacture in Turkey, Morocco and Egypt.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Witty, foul-mouthed, camp and punky, it was the 00s answer to slick superclubs and the rock patriarchy. As its rough, raw sound returns, the scene’s eyeliner-ed heroes, from Peaches to Jonny Slut, relive its excesses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jonny Melton knew that his club night Nag Nag Nag had reached some kind of tipping point when he peered out of the DJ booth and spotted Cilla Black on the dancefloor. “I think that’s the only time I got really excited,” he laughs. “I was playing the Tobi Neumann remix of Khia’s My Neck, My Back, too – ‘my neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack’ – and there was Cilla, grooving on down. You know, it’s not Bobby Gillespie or Gwen Stefani, it’s fucking <em>Cilla Black</em>. I’ve got no idea how she ended up there, but I’ve heard since that she was apparently a bit of a party animal.”</p> <p>It seems fair to say that a visit from Our Cilla was not what Melton expected when he started Nag Nag Nag in London in 2002. A former member of 80s goth band Specimen who DJed under the name Jonny Slut, he’d been inspired by a fresh wave of electronic music synchronously appearing in different locations around the world. Germany had feminist collective Chicks on Speed and DJ Hell with his groundbreaking label International DeeJay Gigolos. France produced Miss Kittin and The Hacker, Vitalic and Electrosexual. Britain spawned icy electro-pop quartet Ladytron and noisy, sex-obsessed trio Add N To (X). Canada spawned Tiga and Merrill Nisker, who abandoned the alt-rock sound of her debut album Fancypants Hoodlum and, with the aid of a Roland MC-505 “groovebox”, reinvented herself as Peaches. New York had performance art inspired duo Fischerspooner and a collection of artists centred around DJ and producer Larry Tee, who gave the sound a name: electroclash.</p> <p>The lyrics tended to be witty, occasionally foul-mouthed and very camp. The sound had house music, techno, 80s synth-pop and electro in its DNA, but boasted a rough-hewn, punky edge, the latter partly down to attitude and partly down to the era’s technological advances. “It isn’t like today, where you can take an idea to a playable version in five hours on a laptop,” says Larry Tee, “but you could record something releasable in your bedroom, you could get a Juno 106 [synthesizer] and alter the sounds and fry and burn them. I’m convinced the best electroclash tracks happened because people made mistakes, the levels were too loud or there was something wrong.”</p>    <p>It was audibly a reaction to something. In Britain, it felt a world apart from the increasingly slick dance scene of superclubs and superstar DJs. In New York, Larry Tee suggests it was a shift away from “trance and tribal house”. For Peaches, who had recorded her 2000 album The Teaches of Peaches in her bedroom, “lying in bed, smoking weed, masturbating and making beats”, it was music made by “marginalised, queer people … who were fed up with a system that was telling us ‘rock music has to be by four beautiful boys down the line from the Rolling Stones, electronic music has to be completely serious like you’re doing brain surgery while turning buttons’. Where was the punk? And for me, I can’t think of another time in music history where women were so at the forefront – Chicks on Speed, Miss Kittin, Tracy + the Plastics. It’s always like, ‘This dude did this’, you know?”</p> <p>Whatever it was an answer to – superclubs or rock’s traditional patriarchy – electroclash seemed to find an audience quickly. It wasn’t the only music Melton and his fellow DJs played at Nag Nag Nag – as underlined by a new 5CD box set, When the 2000s Clashed, they were equally wont to drop old punk singles, early industrial music or the Neptunes’ exploratory R&amp;B – but electroclash was the club’s sonic backbone, and the night was an immediate success. Boosted by approving reviews first in the gay press, then the style magazines, its initial clientele – “a few old goths and some art students in their mum’s old curtains,” according to Melton – were soon joined by a succession of celebrities: Kate Moss, Alexander McQueen, Pet Shop Boys, Boy George, Björk. Perhaps inevitably, it attracted comparisons to celebrated New Romantic hangout the Blitz. “But there was no door policy, no guest list,” demurs Melton. “I didn’t want any of that exclusivity shit. It wasn’t posey at all, there was more a feeling of abandon. It was very hedonistic.”</p> <p>“It was the epitome of amazingness, this incredible melting pot of every kind of character,” says Concetta Kirschner, better known as rapper Princess Superstar, who turned up at Nag Nag Nag while promoting her 2002 UK hit Bad Babysitter. The club had an immediate impact on her sound. “It gave me a shot of freedom. I felt like there were a lot of tightly defined rules in hip-hop. But after Nag Nag Nag, I felt I could experiment, be whatever I wanted, rap over dance music or crazy new rhythms.”</p>    <p>The newly electroclash-adjacent Princess Superstar had a Top 3 hit with Perfect (Exceeder), a collaboration with Dutch producer Mason, but it was the exception that proved the rule. For all the excitement and press coverage it generated, electroclash noticeably failed to produce a major crossover star, although it wasn’t for want of trying in some quarters. The Ministry of Sound’s record label famously spent vast sums signing New York duo Fischerspooner, but their debut album #1 failed to catch light. “Electroclash didn’t work in hygienic conditions,” offers Mark Wood, a DJ and Nag regular behind the new box set. “It worked in clubs that were dark, hot, grubby, full of smoke, all sorts of things going on.”</p> <p>Peaches, meanwhile, went out on tour as a support to hard rock artists, including Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age: their audiences, she says, were “horrified”. “I think a lot of [electroclash artists] were offered these more traditional tours and thought ‘I can’t handle it’. On the Marilyn Manson tour I was spat on every night, but I rapidly developed some prank skills and some great one-liners.”</p> <p>But in Britain at least, electroclash entered the mainstream regardless, audibly impacting on the way existing pop stars sounded. Sugababes rebooted their career with Freak Like Me, a Richard X-produced reimagining of the old Adina Howard hit backed by the music from Tubeway Army’s Are Friends Electric? Another Richard X mashup, Being Nobody, which melded Rufus and Chaka Khan’s Ain’t Nobody with the Human League’s Being Boiled, was a Top 3 hit for Popstars runners-up Liberty X. You could hear echoes of electroclash in Goldfrapp’s platinum-selling 2003 album Black Cherry, Rachel Stevens’ 2004 hit Some Girls and Madonna’s 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor. Even Fischerspooner ended up on Top of the Pops, in the company of Kylie Minogue, performing their remix of Come Into My World.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was girls, gays and theys – and the music industry didn’t invest in those categories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In America, however, the movement provoked a backlash. “It was unfairly beaten up after three or four years,” says Larry Tee. “Electroclash was girls, gays and theys, the music industry didn’t really invest in those three categories, and I think they were as anxious to kill it as they were disco. I think the reason they wanted to burn electroclash so fast is that it didn’t really include that soccer bro culture, which EDM did.”</p> <p>Nag Nag Nag eventually closed its doors in 2008 – the club that hosted it, Ghetto, was demolished to make way for the Crossrail development. It seemed symbolic of the end of something bigger than electroclash. “It was Soho’s last stand as a grubby nightclub place – that’s all literally gone, everything moved east,” says Wood. “It was around the same time that smartphones arrived, which changed everything too. All that happened around the same time electroclash was being put to bed. Nothing lasts for ever if it’s worth having in pop music.”</p> <p>But recently, Jonny Melton noticed something odd. He was being sent new dance tracks that self-described as electroclash, while club nights, including London’s Shackled By Lust and Bloghouse, also use the term to describe what’s on offer. “That would never have happened before,” he laughs. “At the time electroclash was like goth – no one who was in a goth a band would ever admit to being a goth band.”</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in 2023, Peaches embarked on a tour performing her debut album: it was both rapturously received and attracted an audience noticeably big on twentysomethings too young to remember its release. Princess Superstar, whose “career sort of died” in the 2010s, has watched with baffled delight as her electroclash-era hits unexpectedly enjoyed a new lease of life. First, Perfect (Exceeder) belatedly went gold in the US after it was used on the soundtrack of the 2023 movie Saltburn. Then, last year, her 2008 collaboration with Larry Tee, Licky, unexpectedly went viral on TikTok. “I think they thought it was by Britney Spears,” she says. “So I put a video up like, ‘Hey dudes’ and it all went crazy.”</p> <p>She’s currently making new music, some of it in collaboration with Frost Children, a US duo among a wave of younger artists who bear the influence of electroclash: you can hear its strains in Snow Strippers, Confidence Man and the Dare. Larry Tee, who’s currently planning an electroclash documentary, suggests there’s an influence in the music of both Lady Gaga and Charli xcx’s Brat.</p> <p>The music on When the 2000s Clashed still sounds remarkably fresh. Perhaps that fact that most of it remained underground, never dominating the singles chart or the radio playlists helped; so too does the fact that it’s informed by a lot of ideas that were subsequently mainstreamed: it was gender fluid before anyone talked about gender fluidity, sex-positive before anyone used that term either. “I think the younger generation get it,” nods Larry Tee, “because it was like the resistance: we’ve had enough of homophobia, enough of misogyny. For a moment, the door was open.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.demonmusicgroup.co.uk/catalogue/releases/when-the-2000s-clashed-machine-music-for-a-new-millennium-3lp/\">When the 2000s Clashed: Machine Music for a New Millennium</a> is out on 17 October on Demon/Edsel</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the dead of night over many months, a visitor entered our kitchen and wrote in the wee small hours over the doormat. What to read into its silvery doodles other than “I was here, here and here”? I&nbsp;never crept downstairs to interrupt and spoil its mystery; never saw it or worked out how it came and went.</p> <p>Every night it came without fail, until one parched day of the droughty summer. Over the previous few nights, the kitchen trails of our slug or snail had grown thin, thready and shorter. </p> <p>That evening, we walked over the&nbsp;lawn and the dead grass powdered underfoot. How could anything in need of moisture possibly survive? On the following morning and the ones after, there was nothing on the doormat. Stickiness needs sustenance, and it&nbsp;seemed this little gastropod’s life of slime was over.</p> <p>Now, with the return of rain, it’s back and laying trails. Not those feeble semicolon and comma dribbles of late, but the full spaghetti. Not dead as thought, but roused from aestivation, that improbable process by which slugs and snails all but shut down and sit out adverse conditions.</p> <p>And yet still I fret.

Is there dearth under darkness and what might be the wider ramifications?</p> <p>Outside the kitchen door, a morning downpour has brought forth a small battalion of banded snails. A shower is not enough to draw them from the lavender and on to the path; it takes a full soaking&nbsp;to flush them out, and each grazing mollusc appears to be drowning in its own meniscus. Except that they push on, riding through the waves over the concrete meadow, in colours and patterns many and various. Some with shells of cooking-apple green, others rose pink.

    "description": "<p>With his Sundance film festival and institute, Robert Redford used his considerable power to bring generations of talented film-makers to a bigger audience</p>",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-oscar-winning-actor-and-director-dies\">died at the age of 89</a> on Tuesday, will rightly be remembered as one of Hollywood’s finest leading men, a true-blue movie star and assured actor who was, to quote my mother and surely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">many others</a>, “very, very handsome”. His many iconic performances – in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Way We Were, The Sting and more – certainly left an indelible mark on American movies. But he should perhaps be remembered more for his work behind the camera, as the country’s greatest benefactor of independent cinema.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\">Robert Redford: the incandescently handsome star who changed Hollywood forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through his Sundance film festival and non-profit institute, Redford lent his considerable star power and funds to American independent film, and created what is still its most secure and enduring pillar of support. He provided maverick, cutting-edge film-making with a freewheeling marketplace and crucial buzz, helping to launch the careers of a true who’s who of critically acclaimed directors across generations. With Sundance, Redford played the role of mentor, patron, champion of the small and scrappy, benevolent godfather of independent cinema. It’s through Sundance, rather than his films, that Redford became, as the Black List founder Franklin Leonard <a href=\"https://x.com/franklinleonard/status/1967954426414669848\">put it</a> on X, “arguably the film industry’s most consequential American over the last fifty years”.</p> <p>Redford founded the Sundance Institute, named after his character in the 1969 film, in 1981, as a means to support risk-taking voices outside the Hollywood studio system. The mission was loose, but grounded in the then 44-year-old actor’s real frustration with the movie business. “We started this with no rigid expectations,” Redford told the critic Roger Ebert at an early iteration of the film festival in 1981. “I have no idea what this will turn out to be. I know that it’s getting increasingly hard to get a movie well distributed in this country unless it has the potential to make millions of dollars.” As an alternative experiment, Redford invited 10 screenwriters to develop their low-budget scripts at a cabin in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, where the reclusive star had purchased land and made his home.</p>    <p>The tiny Sundance Institute grew into a small festival after Redford purchased the struggling Utah/US film festival in 1984. By 1989, when Steven Soderbergh’s Sex, Lies and Videotape premiered at what had become an annual January gathering in Park City, the Sundance film festival (as it was renamed in 1991) represented the creative vanguard. Some of the most influential and enduring films of the 1990s came out of the festival – Reservoir Dogs, Before Sunrise and The Blair Witch Project, as well as the documentaries Hoop Dreams and Paris Is Burning.</p> <p>The festival has built a reputation as a pipeline of diverse talent; top directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Richard Linklater, Chloé Zhao, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Nicole Holofcener, David O Russell, Darren Aronofsky, the Daniels and Celine Song have all been nurtured at some point in their early career by Sundance. In 2022, Coda, directed by Sian Heder with a $10m budget, became the first festival premiere to win the best picture Oscar. “Coda came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” its star Marlee Matlin posted on X. “And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford.”</p> <p>Alongside its renegade narrative features, the festival has also become the go-to destination for hot-button documentaries, particularly those grappling with tough, timely subjects. The <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/tv-documentaries-ethical-standards.html\">documentary streaming boom</a> arguably began at the festival in 2017, when Netflix purchased Icarus, a film on the Russian doping scandal that went on to win the Oscar – Netflix’s first – for a then staggering sum of $5m. For several years after, the festival was a hot marketplace for documentaries large and small. Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Brooke Shields and Michael J Fox debuted films about them in Utah; documentaries on such figures as Christopher Reeves, the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Hillary Clinton generated international headlines and commanded ever-larger sums. Though the market has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/01/documentaries-oscars\">cooled</a>, the festival remains an incubator for pressing documentaries – this year saw films on Florida’s stand-your-ground laws, abysmal Alabama prisons and US book bans in schools – as well as awards. Institute-supported documentaries have <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/sundance-institute-has-long-history-of-oscar-winning-documentaries/\">won a total of 20 Oscars</a>; all but one of last year’s best documentary nominees premiered at the festival.</p> <p>With mainstream acclaim come major celebrities, and with celebrities come crowds, sponsors and influencers. Starting in the 2010s, the festival has been as synonymous with celebrities in trendy winter wear, long lines and pop-up brand houses as independent film. After years of logistical issues – what once drew a few hundred cinephiles to the mountains now courts upwards of 85,000 visitors every January – the festival announced earlier this year that it would relocate in 2027 to Boulder, Colorado.</p>    <p>But the institute has remained true to Redford’s founding mission. According to Sundance, more than 11,000 early career artists have received support since its founding, in the form of grants, labs, intensive programs, mentorship and fellowships. I personally know film-makers and writers who have applied to the lab, considered the pinnacle of early-stage mentorship, an imprimatur of taste and trust. And since the establishment of its Native American and Indigenous program in 1994, the non-profit remains one of the pre-eminent supporters of Indigenous film talent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/sep/02/its-a-completely-new-day-the-rise-of-indigenous-films-and-tv-shows\">too-long ignored by institutional Hollywood</a>. The program’s grants, labs and community have helped launch the careers of Chris Eyre (whose film Smoke Signals premiered in 1998), Reservation Dogs’ Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi.</p> <p>In his later years, Redford often groused about the mainstreaming of the festival to which he devoted nearly half his life; “I want the ambush marketers – the vodka brands and the gift-bag people and the Paris Hiltons – to go away forever,” he told a reporter during the 2012 festival. It is true that the festival is not the iconoclastic upstart it once was, and that the festival produces a few imitative “Sundance movies” – spare, underwritten dramas with beautiful vistas and natural light – every year. But the impact of Sundance – in time, in space, in mentorship, money and community – is incalculable to the landscape of American cinema. Redford’s goal, as he said in his 2002 honorary Oscar speech, was to “make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive”. With 40 years of stewardship at Sundance, Robert Redford has done more than most to ensure that it will.</p>",

The man had been due to be on a flight to France at 9am on Wednesday.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, halted his removal after a decision came through during the court hearing that his claims to be a victim of trafficking required further investigation.</p> <p>The ruling is a significant blow to the government because many of those due to be removed under the scheme are potential victims of trafficking. Because they have only recently arrived in the UK they have not had an opportunity to have their trafficking claim fully investigated nor to obtain expert medical and psychological reports.</p> <p>The Home Office argued against halting the removal, saying that the man could get further evidence to support his trafficking claim from France. On Tuesday evening, Sheldon said he was “going to grant a short period of interim relief”.</p> <p>The judgment came after a decision from the national referral mechanism, which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking, and the invitation from the body for the man to make further representations.</p> <p>In his oral ruling, Sheldon said: “It seems there is a serious issue to be tried with respect of the trafficking claim and whether or not the secretary of state has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.</p> <p>“In my view there’s a serious case to be tried as to whether or not the removal decision is lawful. If there is a reasonable suspicion he has been trafficked that would amount to a statutory bar for removal, at least for a short period of time.”</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/no-10-denies-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-is-shambles\">Downing Street denied that the returns deal with France was in chaos</a> after plans to forcibly remove from the UK people arriving in small boats were abandoned on Monday and Tuesday. The prime minister’s spokesperson was forced to deny that the latest delay meant the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">agreement</a> was a “shambles” when asked by reporters.</p> <p>A government source said the first flight was expected to take off this week.</p> <p>Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, which is supporting detainees earmarked for removal to France, said: “We welcome the high court decision to halt this man’s flight so that details of his case can be considered. We are in contact with people detained for the one-in, one-out scheme, the vast majority of whom are torture and trafficking survivors.</p> <p>“The largest group is from Eritrea. Due to the nature of what they have experienced in the countries they have passed through, histories of modern slavery and sexual abuse are recurring.”</p> <p>Ministers agreed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/first-people-detained-one-in-one-out-asylum-deal-uk-france-immigration\">one-in, one-out pilot scheme</a> with the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat crossings so far this year.</p> <p>The first detentions of migrants took place last month as the deal came into force and they have been held at an immigration removal centre pending their removal from the country.</p> <p>Under the arrangement, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.</p> <p>Sonali Naik KC, representing the unnamed man, told the court on Tuesday he faced a “real risk of destitution” if he was put on a flight to France. She said there was a “serious issue to be tried” and that the man risked destitution in France, something the judge said he did not believe would be the case. The court heard evidence that about a third of asylum seekers in France were not accommodated and given a daily allowance of €7.50.</p> <p>Kate Grange KC, for the Home Office, said it was important for the agreement with France to go ahead because of the continuing risk to life of Channel crossings. “Serious injury and death, including of children, from small boat crossings in the English Channel is a grave social and political concern at the present time,” she said.</p> <p>The Tories said Labour’s returns deal with France was “another failed gimmick” after a scheduled deportation was blocked following a last-minute legal challenge.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a British national on suspicion of the murder of the Kenyan woman Agnes Wanjiru, who was found dead in the grounds of a hotel near an army base in 2012.</p> <p>The high court judge Alexander Muteti issued the arrest warrant earlier on Tuesday in Kenya, with the prosecution telling the court a suspect had been charged with murder, and his extradition to Kenya was being sought.</p> <p>UK-based witnesses will be called on to testify in a future trial, the prosecution said. “The witnesses are in United Kingdom but we will avail them,” the court heard.</p> <p>The office of the director of public prosecutions informed the court that the accused had been charged with the offence of murder.</p> <p>Wanjiru, 21, was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out in the Lion’s Court hotel in her home town of Nanyuki on 31 March 2012.</p> <p>She disappeared that night, with friends and family searching for her, until her body was found months later stuffed inside a septic tank at the hotel.</p> <p>Wanjiru, who worked as a hairdresser, and sometimes sold sex for extra money, had a daughter, Stacey, who was just five months old at the time that she disappeared.</p> <p>It is understood that Kenyan authorities will begin extradition proceedings, with the intention that the soldier will face charges in Kenya.</p> <p>“We have lived with the pain of Agnes’s death for over a decade,” her family said in a statement. “The reports that an arrest warrant has been issued against a UK citizen is a significant moment for us and is incredibly welcome.”</p> <p>Tessa Gregory, the family’s lawyer and a partner at Leigh Day, added: “The family now calls upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible.”</p> <p>If he is extradited, it is believed it will be the first time a current or former British soldier has ever been extradited to another country to face trial for the murder of a civilian.</p> <p>Wanjiru’s death has already been the focus of two inquests and several criminal inquiries.</p> <p>The bar of the Lion’s Court hotel was a popular destination for British soldiers, who were based at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) in Nanyuki, which is about 125 miles north of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>The inquest heard that Wanjiru had last been seen leaving the bar with one or more British soldiers.</p> <p>A suspect was named by several soldiers who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, after an investigation into the murder by the Sunday Times in 2021.</p> <p>Since the newspaper identified a suspected killer, it is understood that Kenyan detectives have flown to the UK several times to question soldiers and ex-soldiers who were in Nanyuki at the time of the murder.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the defence secretary, John Healey, met Wanjiru’s family in Kenya and promised the UK’s “full support” for the investigation.</p> <p>“It was deeply humbling to meet the family of Agnes Wanjiru today,” Healey said in April. “In the 13 years since her death, they have shown such strength in their long fight for justice. I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.”</p> <p>Previously, as shadow defence secretary, Healey had called on the then Conservative government to do more to resolve the case.</p> <p>“Agnes’s death has had a profound and devastating impact on our family,” her relatives previously said in a statement.</p> <p>“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death.”<br><br>“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a spokesperson for the UK government said.</p> <p>“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.</p> <p>“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”</p> <p>No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.<strong> </strong>The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The owner of the ceramics business Wedgwood has said it will freeze production at its factory in Staffordshire for 90 days in a move that will place 70 workers on temporary leave.</p> <p>The shutdown, which the firm’s owner, Fiskars Group, described as a short-term measure, will start on 29 September in response to weaker demand in some of its most important markets.</p> <p>It will also pause factory tours at its World of Wedgwood tourist attraction, with plans to restart them early next year.</p> <p>Wedgwood, which can trace its heritage to the 18th century, makes porcelain and luxury home accessories.</p> <p>It is headquartered in Barlaston near Stoke-on-Trent, where it employs 274 people. The company said it had many more people working globally for the business in markets such as China and Japan, where it has the majority of its stores.</p> <p>The pottery and ceramics sector has struggled in recent years under the pressure of rising costs and energy bills. A number of potteries have collapsed in Staffordshire, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/18/staffordshire-potteries-ceramics-companies-closures-royal-stafford\">the nearly 200-year-old Royal Stafford in February.</a></p> <p>A Wedgwood spokesperson said: “This short-term measure is being taken to address elevated inventory levels caused by lower consumer demand in some of our key markets.</p> <p>“Barlaston and its community are of key importance to Fiskars Group and Wedgwood.”</p> <p>The company said its artisans still used techniques pioneered by founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/01/wedgwood-collection-v-and-a-treasures\">Josiah Wedgwood, who was born in Staffordshire in 1730.</a></p> <p>“This living tradition reflects our commitment to craftsmanship, the value of Made in England and Barlaston’s enduring role in our heritage and operations,” a Fiskars spokesperson said.</p> <p>Fiskars, which employs 6,850 people across its group, also owns Royal Doulton and the Danish porcelain brand Royal Copenhagen, among others.</p> <p>The business, which is listed in Finland, reported net sales of €1.2bn (£1bn) in its 2024 financial year, up slightly from €1.1bn in the previous year. Its pre-tax profit, however, fell by 77% from €79.7m to €18.5m.</p> <p>The group lowered its profit guidance for the year in June, blaming the impact of US tariffs on retailer demand. The US accounts for about 30% of its overall sales.</p> <p>Wedgwood dates back to 1759, when Josiah Wedgwood started as an independent potter in Staffordshire. He invented new ceramic materials such as jasperware and black basalt, and was among the first makers to stamp his name on his product. He was the grandfather of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/16/great-dynasities-the-darwins\">Charles Darwin.</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Manufacturers say new rules on passing on assets threaten investment and future survival of businesses</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p> <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p> <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p> <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p> <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p> <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p> <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p> <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p> <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p> <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>. </p> <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p> <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p> <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p> <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>    <p>A study by CBI Economics found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p> <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p> <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p> <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p> <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p> <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p> <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p> <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p> <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p> <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p> <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Jaguar Land Rover says cyber-attack has affected ‘some data’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p> <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p> <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p> <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p> <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p> <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p> <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p> <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The first three defendants in England and Wales charged with showing support for the banned group Palestine Action have pleaded not guilty to charges under the Terrorism Act.</p> <p>Jeremy Shippam, 72, of Yapton, West Sussex, Judit Murray, 71, of West Ewell, Surrey, and Fiona Maclean, 53, of Hackney, north-east London, will face trial in March next year for allegedly holding placards saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action”.</p> <p>Appearing at Westminster magistrates court in central London on Tuesday, the three all denied the same charge of displaying an article, namely a placard, in a public place, arousing reasonable suspicion that they are a supporter of a proscribed organisation, contrary to section 13 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>The defendants, who appeared before the chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, were allowed to sit outside the dock as two are hard of hearing and hearing loops could not be found for them.</p> <p>Since the ban on Palestine Action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">came into effect on 5 July</a>, 138 people in England and Wales have been charged with showing support for the group, out of more than 1,600 people arrested.</p> <p>The three in court on Tuesday were all arrested at a demonstration in Parliament Square, central London, on the day the ban took effect. They could face a maximum sentence of six months in jail and/or a fine if convicted. They were released in conditional bail until 16 March.</p> <p>A group of protesters gathered outside the court building shouting pro-Palestine slogans, waving flags and carrying placards.</p> <p>The next protest in Parliament Square opposing proscription is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/week-protests-palestine-action-ban-begin-labour-conference\">scheduled for 4 October</a>, ending a week of planned demonstrations beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Negotiations soon to begin on UK’s entry to Safe scheme, which it hopes will secure bigger role for its defence firms</p>",
    "content": "<p>France has proposed limiting the use of British-produced military components in the EU’s €150bn defence fund, in a move that could complicate negotiations over the UK’s entry into the scheme.</p> <p>Four diplomatic sources told the Guardian that French officials had proposed a 50% ceiling on the value of UK components in projects financed through the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) fund.</p> <p>The €150bn loans scheme is part of the EU’s drive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine\">to boost defence spending by €800bn and re-arm the continent</a>. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, lauded the scheme on Tuesday, telling an audience of policymakers in Brussels that the commission had assigned loans to member states in less than six months since the idea was first mooted – “the sense of urgency we need”.</p> <p>The door to greater UK participation was pushed open in May when Keir Starmer and von der Leyen signed an <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eu-uk-security-and-defence-partnership_en\">EU-UK security and defence partnership</a>. Without this pact, the UK could never supply more than 35% of the value of components of any Safe-funded project.</p> <p>Yet the UK still needs to negotiate a technical agreement to secure a bigger role for its defence firms, and the EU could impose limits on British participation. The British government also needs to negotiate a fee to join the scheme.</p> <p>The limits on British inputs were suggested during internal meetings as EU member states prepare a negotiating mandate for the European Commission before talks with Keir Starmer’s government.</p> <p>The UK and commission will negotiate the cost and terms of British entry into Safe in the coming weeks, but first the EU needs unanimity on its position.</p> <p>A large majority of member states oppose restrictions on UK participation, as they want flexibility over defence procurement. One EU diplomat described the proposed 50% limit as “the classic French obsession”.</p> <p>France has long championed the idea of a European defence industry autonomous from the US: it has also argued that since Brexit, Britain can no longer reap the benefits of the EU’s single market.</p> <p>The UK does not intend to apply for loans, which are earmarked for EU member states, but hopes British defence companies will benefit from the spending bonanza. A formal agreement to enter Safe would make it easier for British firms to be part of defence supply chains to provide kit, ranging from small drones, ammunition and infantry weapons to artillery systems with deep precision strike capabilities.</p> <p>A spokesperson at the French permanent representation in Brussels said: “We support the European commission in its efforts to establish the parameters for the UK’s association with Safe. The basis for this is provided by the Safe regulation, which stipulates among other principles that some of the components must come from the EU’s industry.”</p> <p>The UK also needs to negotiate the fee for joining the scheme, intended to cover administrative costs. The EU’s most senior diplomats are due on Wednesday to discuss British entry to Safe, as well as a parallel text for Canada, which also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/canada-eu-defense-trump-us-allies\">recently signed a defence and security pact with the bloc</a>.</p> <p>The European Commission’s spokesperson on defence, Thomas Regnier, said: “The UK is an essential partner and ally for the EU, with whom the president has signed a security and defence partnership in May. They have a very advanced defence industry, we share many common interests, hence our will to sign a win-win agreement to fully associate them to our Safe instrument.”</p> <p>The commission announced that last week 19 EU countries would take out Safe loans. Poland is taking out the largest loan, of €43.7bn, almost one third of the total. France and Hungary will borrow €16.2bn each, Romania €16.7bn and Italy €14.9bn. The EU-backed loans lower the cost of borrowing for many member states and can be spent on supplying national armies or aiding Ukraine.</p>",

Back home, his father flicks through TV channels while his mother counts bags of flour. No one speaks. The silence is broken only by crackles on the radio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9/0_0_1968_2912/676.jpg\" alt=\"A magazine cover with graphic novel-like drawings of an African boy, a line of people queueing for water, the boy running away from two others, someone lying in bed and a city street    \" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma is published in The Continent, a pan-African e-paper </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Edizon Musavuli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By evening, Baraka is sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, looking south to Bukavu and east towards Rwanda, finding no hope in either direction.</p> <p>This is the opening to Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, the first comic by a 31-year-old visual artist, Edizon Musavuli, published earlier this year in the Continent, a weekly pan-African newspaper. The story depicts everyday struggles in Goma through the eyes of a child.</p> <p>Prominent Congolese artists such as Barly Baruti, Fifi Mukuna and Papa Mfumu’Eto, who captured the public’s imagination in comic strips in the past, mainly worked abroad or in Kinshasa, a city more than a thousand miles from Goma. But there are few contemporary comics set in or about the Democratic Republic of the Congo written by Congolese artists.</p>    <p>“I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil,” Musavuli says of his journey as an artist. He began to pursue the craft seriously only after finishing high school, enrolling at the Africa Digital Media Institute in Nairobi. His studies, however, were cut short by financial difficulties.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Art gives hope. It’s something to start with </p> <footer> <cite>Edizon Musavuli</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His first solo exhibition was in January 2020, organised with the French Institute of Goma. “It was a really big exhibition. [And] it was impressive how everyone responded to it,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>But just a year later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/21/children-executed-and-women-raped-in-front-of-their-families-as-m23-militia-unleashes-fresh-terror-on-drc\">brutal M23 militia, backed by Rwanda</a>, resurfaced in eastern DRC and upended Goma’s fragile art scene.</p> <p>“Artists in Goma are really reliant on French exhibitions like that,” he says. “If they’re not around, it will feel like we don’t exist. That’s what’s happening right now.”</p>    <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/m23-rebel-group-goma-drc-democratic-republic-congo-rwanda\">M23 captured Goma</a> in January this year, the city’s creative spaces faltered alongside its economy. “Art gives hope. It’s something to start with, but our situation here doesn’t change. So people [in Goma] are not really interested any more,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>Artists and creativity have long been consigned to the margins of the state agenda. “We are not really something the government prioritises,” he says.</p>    <p>Turning to Instagram, he began sharing personal and collective experiences of Congolese life in the form of cartoons. In one post, recounting his childhood, he captioned an interactive story: “I’m from where you learn to run before you walk.”</p> <p>In one reel, which has since generated more than 10,000 views, he is seen working on an unfinished painting, while gunshots are heard in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A short video of graphic art illustrating the history of the Congo  \">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

The story is charged with political undertones, highlighting how ordinary routines have been stripped away and replaced with constant uncertainty.</p> <p>Yet Musavuli insists the short comic was not meant as explicit political commentary: “I’m not really a political artist or activist [but] I say what people around me are thinking. That’s how I do my art.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We might not have power but not doing anything is so much worse.

    "description": "<p>Music Box Theatre, New York</p><p>Post-late-night, the star makes an exceptional return to the stage in this moderately entertaining comedy of male friendship</p>",
    "content": "<p>By now, September 2025, a certain formula has solidified on Broadway: stage a familiar-ish play, cast well-known film and TV actors, set a limited run and tickets will hopefully sell, or at least command high prices. It’s a commercially strong bet – while most Broadway musicals are failing financially, six plays have already become profitable: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/11/oh-mary-review-cole-escola-broadway\">Oh, Mary!</a> (starring Cole Escola), All In: Comedy About Love (John Mulaney, Jimmy Fallon, et al) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/24/romeo-juliet-broadway-review\">Romeo + Juliet</a> (Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/mar/24/othello-review-denzel-washington-jake-gyllenhaal\">Othello</a> (Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/01/glengarry-glen-ross-broadway-review\">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> (Bob Odenkirk, Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/03/good-night-good-luck-review-george-clooney\">Good Night, and Good Luck</a> (George Clooney).</p> <p>It’s led to some grousing – about ticket prices, about a Hollywood invasion, about the spirit of Broadway. I’m generally agnostic on this – Broadway has always run on star wattage, and screen actors certainly provide some – but it does change how audiences interact with the material. People enter the theater with preconceived notions, certain expectations or, in the case of John Krasinski’s solo show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jun/12/angry-alan-review-john-krasinski#:~:text=It's%20a%20fascinating%20use%20of,straight%20men's%20feelings%20as%20prey.\">Angry Alan,</a> the specter of one very beloved sitcom character. Actors and directors can work with it, subvert it, challenge it, submit to it, but the celebrity factor won’t disappear. There’s no such thing as a blank canvas.</p> <p>Tell that to Marc (Bobby Cannavale), a middle-aged man deeply troubled by his friend’s purchase of an all-white painting in Art, the latest limited-run, starry revival to open on Broadway. Serge (Neil Patrick Harris) sees lines, shadows, depth within the 4ft x 5ft canvas. Marc stares very hard, tries different angles – Cannavale, a two-time Tony nominee, wrings laughs out of this silent effort – but sees nothing but offensive folly in his friend’s $300,000 purchase. Their mutual friend Yvan (James Corden), less professionally successful but more open-hearted, sees whatever is needed to keep his friends agreeable.</p> <p>Yasmina Reza’s French-language play, first staged in Paris in 1994, then Broadway in 1998, is a study of male friendship. Which means that these three longtime friends – 25 years of friendship, we’re told – spend an inordinate amount of time talking about a painting that, at least to a viewer at the Music Box Theatre, appears as a large white rectangle. (Harris’s plaintive Serge, speaking directly to the audience, insists: it is not white!) This would grate – it skirts the edge of wearisome – if not for three solid performances and the timeless insight of Reza’s script, translated here by Christopher Hampton, into men’s coded language of feeling.</p> <p>Indirectness, of course, knows no sex or gender. But part of the magic of Reza’s play, staged here by Scott Ellis (most recently the director of Doubt), is the seamless demonstration of the lengths men will go to avoid speaking emotions plainly, the delicacy with which she writes specifically, identifiably male versions of passive aggression and avoidance. In a tight and uninterrupted 90 minutes set in one apartment – Ellis keeps the setting somewhere in Paris, though David Rockwell’s set evokes antiseptic luxury Brooklyn high-rise – the three actors capably ride a friendship devolution through some moderately entertaining shouting matches and quieter, cutting confessions.</p> <p>Harris and Cannavale make light work of these two politely adversarial aesthetes – the former crisp and tightly wound, the latter swaggering and easily wounded, both a little detestable. But it’s Corden, returning to Broadway for the first time since winning a Tony in 2012 for One Man, Two Guvnors), who steals the show, in a bit of stage image rehab post-Carpool Karaoke and, for the chronically online, Balthazar ban. As both the heart and the court jester for the show, Corden is superb, a perfectly calibrated level of hysterical, sincere and crisp. One blistering monologue sees him ranting, in the voice of three separate characters, for several minutes straight without missing a beat; it was not celebrity compelling the extended applause when he finally collapsed, spent and spittle-covered, into a chair.</p> <p>You can only talk art for so long. All three characters eventually crack open, though not, perhaps, to the degree one would hope, as Serge and Marc still rely on abstractions of taste, influence, ideas. It’s when Yvan crumbles, tearfully admitting the significance of these friends in this life, that the production unlocks some prismatic, elusive sentiment, a color noticeably missing from the canvas. Or maybe that’s just my reading, colored by many a frustrating attempt to pull emotions out of a man. Ultimately with any play, just as painting, you supply your own background and see what you see.</p>",

The argument that mastering AI is a life skill that students need in preparation for the labour market is unconvincing. Our experience is that generative AI undermines teaching and learning, bypasses reflection and criticality, and deflects students from reading&nbsp;original material.</p> <p>Student misuse of generative AI is widespread. Claims that AI helps preparation or research is simply cover for students taking shortcuts that do not develop their learning skills. Assessments are widely channelled through ChatGPT, disregarding universities’ usually feeble guidance and rules. Generative AI results in generic, dull and often factually incorrect output. </p> <p>For example, we asked students to interpret a short article by Henry Ford from 1922. Many answers suggested that the autocratic and racist Ford was developing a “sophisticated HR performance management function for his business” and that he was a “transformational leader”. </p> <p>In many degree programmes, LLMs have little to no practical value.

    "description": "<p>Readers respond to Jonathan Liew’s article about the effects of the toxic debate on immigration and the rise of the far right</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jonathan Liew’s article is a reminder that the immigration debate is never only about policy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/immigration-debate-country-remigration-right\">What is the endgame in this toxic immigration debate: is it friends and neighbours thrown out of the country?, 10 September</a>). It is about the value placed on human lives. He shows how language presented as reasonable or pragmatic often conceals darker intentions. What once felt impossible can be normalised step by step, until the unthinkable is treated as common&nbsp;sense.</p> <p>The strength of his piece lies in how it makes the issue personal. By asking us to picture the knock at the door, the packed bags by the hallway, or the quiet hostility from a stranger on a bus, he shows that this is not about statistics but about neighbours, colleagues and friends being treated as outsiders.</p> <p>This is not unique to Britain. Far-right parties across Europe are pushing “remigration” into the political mainstream, and Britain is not immune. The danger is that a hostile environment rarely stops at the margins. It spreads into daily life, encouraging cruelty and suspicion, making racial abuse easier to excuse and prejudice easier to voice. Even if mass deportations never take place on the scale some imagine, the harm is already being felt.</p> <p>The question Liew poses is simple: if this direction continues, what kind of country will we become and who will have the courage to say “enough” before it is too late.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• Thank you, Jonathan Liew, for speaking with such clarity for me as the son of Caribbean immigrants who came to this country as British citizens at the invitation of the British government in 1962. I was born here, have a UK passport, and have contributed to British society. This is my home. But I am scared that a Nigel Farage-led government would want to enact large-scale repatriation of people like me.</p> <p>For people of colour, this isn’t an exaggeration – it is based on fact. The UK has had a growing tolerance of racism and xenophobia, but this is the recooked racism of Enoch Powell and the National Front of the last century – and it’s getting nasty. The time to be sitting in complicit silence is over. <br><strong>Cllr Mark Blake</strong><br><em>Green party, Haringey, London</em></p> <p>• I found Jonathan Liew’s article sad and troubling. My father was Polish and, growing up in the 1950s and 60s in the UK, I was sometimes worried that I had a foreign name. But nothing was said or implied, and being white meant I was not an immediate target for racists. And then we became, I thought, a more tolerant society, with racism called out and reduced to a tiny minority of bigots. But in 2016 came Brexit, leading to the shameful return of the open racism we see today.</p> <p>Old fears are being renewed, and our spineless leaders seem incapable of standing up against this putrid tide. My only hope is that the majority of people, who are not racist, can bring strong influence to bear on our representatives at all levels, and let our own voices be heard. This must stop.<br><strong>Maria Koval</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• I am white, living in Lincolnshire and married to a first-generation Indian immigrant. In this part of the world, not only has Reform UK captured the hearts and minds of many neighbours, but you can see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/23/members-of-far-right-party-organising-asylum-hotel-protests-across-uk-facebook-posts-show\">Homeland party</a>, with its policy of remigration, gaining strength. Jonathan Liew’s piece so clearly brought home the rising terror that I now feel for my family, and the need to push back more forcefully against support for these policies.<br><strong>Patrick Horton</strong><br><em>Stamford, Lincolnshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p>Kirk’s rise to fame was largely bolstered by being extremely online – and it seems the suspect has that in common</p>",
    "content": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who promises he’ll come back from vacation. Meanwhile, I’m looking at the memes, gaming and internet culture behind the shooting of Charlie Kirk.</p> <p>The bullet that killed conservative activist was inscribed with a message: “Notices bulge OwO whats this?” The online world quickly recognized the reference. It’s a phrase used in internet culture to troll people in online role-play communities, specifically furries (a subculture that cosplays as anthropomorphic animal characters).</p> <p>“The phrase has been popularized not only as a way of making fun of furries and related communities for being cringe, but has also been embraced by furries as a way of owning the meme,” writes <a href=\"https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-the-notices-bulge-owo-whats-this-meme-the-phrase-inscribed-on-the-casing-of-the-bullet-fired-at-charlie-kirk-explained\">Know Your Meme</a>, a website that documents viral phenomena. “Ultimately, the phrase is portrayed in memes as being one of the most cringeworthy things someone could possibly write to another person.”</p> <p>Other bullet casings recovered by law enforcement in Utah also had etched inscriptions that appeared to nod to online gaming and insider memes, which have become part of the intense social media speculation on a possible motive for the killing. One said: “O Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao”, another said: “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO.” The first message refers to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/11/bella-ciao-resistance-anthem-history-meps-strasbourg-viktor-orban\">Italian anti-fascist folk song</a> that has become a gamer reference that’s big in Twitch and Discord circles. The second message is what web culture writer Ryan Broderick calls “just boilerplate edgelord speak” in his <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme?utm_source=www.garbageday.email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme&amp;_bhlid=c1bd8655d3ca168eb692fc88c054fa5a4ec0f5e9\">newsletter last week</a> titled “Charlie Kirk was killed by a meme”.</p> <p>The final inscribed casing that law enforcement released said: “Hey fascist! Catch!” and was followed by an up arrow, right arrow and three down arrow symbols. The arrow sequence appears to reference the video game Helldivers 2, and is a set of commands used by players to<a href=\"https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb\"> release a 500kg bomb</a> in the game.</p> <p>The alleged shooter, Tyler James Robinson, is a 22-year-old from a small town in Utah near the Arizona border. He is accused of killing Kirk at a campus event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired with a “high-powered bolt action rifle” from a distant rooftop.</p> <p>As the suspect was steeped in online culture, so was Charlie Kirk, who was 31. He was at the school on behalf of his conservative youth organization, Turning Point USA. He’d become known worldwide speaking about and debating others, often on his extremist views on race, immigration, gender identity and gun rights. Kirk’s rise to fame was also largely bolstered by being extremely online.</p> <p>As my colleague <em><strong>Alaina Demopoulos</strong></em> wrote:</p> <p><em>A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.</em></p> <p><em>Kirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn’t agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events.

And another by Meta’s former head of security for WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, who alleges the company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/technology/whatsapp-whistleblower-lawsuit.html\">brushed aside major security and privacy flaws</a> in its messaging app, according to the New York Times.</p> <p>In response to my reporting about VR devices, Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing. “These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.</p> <p>One of the first whistleblowers was Sophie Zhang, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang\">brought her findings to the Guardian</a> in 2021. Zhang documented how Facebook allowed political manipulation in more than 25 countries, which led to disastrous circumstances in several places including Myanmar, Azerbaijan and Honduras. Later that same year, Frances Haugen <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiYvVVTuGq2qxCs5kdvOyFVY1Z4AXuXEKPenRX384QOyEkDtDbmmiXcX5FMilM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c4ba92&amp;gaa_sig=Yg19r_tYezZtPdSGgXPGIREbdOvG08JTmaTHaY_m_mA7GAyPbjbtS7D-lpX_9UcukuydsL4laFso7zj_yjB9iQ%3D%3D\">turned over to the Wall Street Journal</a> reams of documentation verifying much of Zhang’s allegations and also bringing to light Facebook’s knowledge of how its social media apps harmed teens.</p> <p>In 2023, Arturo Bejar also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/instagram-facebook-teens-harassment-safety-5d991be1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiXGIQSY3aTBMnlSqMe1XIoujWyaSUlTONbyijuYASrehQ0UAsFa3p-iu_Z2QA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c4bb10&amp;gaa_sig=783wMI0ACofnXrmDHT6ZNwmGbOIG3v_2mO0H8adsx41yApSFzhWSnX3DF3eNjCNF1JgEh9asdDsf7xc0y-FGwA%3D%3D\">went to the Wall Street Journal</a> with evidence that Meta knew its algorithms for Facebook and Instagram were pushing content to teens that promoted bullying, drug abuse, eating disorders<strong> </strong>and self-harm.</p> <p>This year alone, eight more whistleblowers have come forward. Baig and the group of six former and current employees went public last week.</p> <p>US lawmakers are taking the allegations seriously. Politicians as disparate as Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, the democrat from Connecticut, have said they see eye-to-eye when it comes to regulating Meta and other social media companies.</p> <p>“The details in these disclosures are hard to stomach – because they reveal such major risks to kids’ safety, and because they are so painfully familiar. Yet again, Meta is revealed to be willfully misrepresenting abuses on its platforms,” Blumenthal said of the whistleblower claims last week. “‘Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil’ is simply not an acceptable business philosophy.”</p> <p>Blumenthal added that he and other senators were looking forward to pushing ahead with “long overdue reform”.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/google-gemini-ai-training-humans\">How thousands of ‘overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI to seem smart</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/who-is-larry-ellison-richest-person-oracle\">Larry Ellison: Oracle co-founder who overtook Musk as world’s richest person</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/apple-iphone-17\">Apple debuts thinner, $999 iPhone Air at ‘awe-dropping’ annual product event</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/how-to-save-the-internet-by-nick-clegg-review-spinning-silicon-valley\">How to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg review – spinning Silicon Valley</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’</a></p></li> </ul>",

Other production facilities around the world have also been affected, fuelling speculation that it could be weeks until systems are operational.</p> <p>The freeze has also affected suppliers and retailers for JLR, with some operating without computer systems and databases normally used for sourcing spare parts for garages or registering vehicles.</p> <p>Last week, the Unite union warned that thousands of workers in the JLR supply chain were at risk of losing their livelihoods, and urged the government to step in with a furlough scheme to support them.</p> <p>Disruption from the cyber-attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/07/disruption-to-jaguar-land-rover-after-cyber-attack-may-last-until-october\">could last until October</a>.

The carmaker reported that underlying pre-tax profits dropped 49% to £351m in the three months to June. That included a period when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/05/jaguar-land-rover-us-shipments-trumps-tariffs\">company temporarily paused exports to the US</a>.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/02/images-of-new-electric-jaguar-car-leak-out-before-official-miami-unveiling\"> company also faced criticism last year over its rebrand of Jaguar</a>, and its new electric cars are not expected to launch until next year.</p> <p>Chris McDonald, a minister at the business department, said on Tuesday: “We know this is a worrying time for those affected by this incident and our cyber experts are supporting JLR to help them resolve this issue as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“I met the company today to discuss their plans to resolve this issue and get production started again, and we continue to discuss the impact on the supply chain.” </p>",

    "description": "<p>FAA ruled to have satisfied obligations in granting approval for expanded SpaceX operations next to wildlife refuge</p>",
    "content": "<p>A US district court judge on Monday rejected a suit by conservation groups challenging the Federal Aviation Administration approval in 2022 of expanded rocket launch operations by Elon Musk’s SpaceX next to a national wildlife refuge in south Texas.</p> <p>The groups said noise, light pollution, construction and road traffic also degrade the area, home to endangered ocelots and jaguarundis, as well as nesting sites for endangered Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles and for threatened shorebirds.</p> <p>US district judge Carl Nichols in Washington said the FAA had satisfied its obligation “to take a hard look at the effects of light on nearby wildlife”.</p> <p>Donald Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\">executive order</a> on 13 August – titled Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry – that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-order-rocket-launches-musk-bezos\">relax environmental rules</a> for commercial spaceship companies, apparently benefitting Elon Musk. The companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).</p> <p>Private space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the FAA. And, as part of that process, companies are subject to review under Nepa.</p> <p>These environmental reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be enormously disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings. Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks and falling objects.</p> <p>Trump said it was imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase launches “substantially” by 2030.</p> <p>SpaceX has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/hawaii-elon-musk-spacex-rocket-debris\">seeking to increase its rocket launches</a> and landings around the country even as it has been embroiled in the lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. The groups say the FAA did not do a thorough enough environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas.</p> <p>The lawsuit looked at the first launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket in Texas in April 2023. The rocket, which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying six miles (10km) away. The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 1.5 hectares (4 acres) of state park and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs.</p> <p>The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25. SpaceX has also been seeking to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-09/spacex-hopes-to-nearly-double-the-rocket-launches-off-the-california-coast-a-state-panel-likely-to-object\">increase launches</a> of its smaller Falcon rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.</p> <p><em>Dara Kerr contributed reporting</em></p>",

The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p> <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p> <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p> <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 September 2025.

Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p> <p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrissey </strong>adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rachel Vahey, </strong>head of public policy at <strong>AJ Bell, </strong>points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p> <p><strong>Vahey </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p> <p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p> </blockquote> <p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary <strong>Liz</strong> <strong>Kendall</strong> said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/21/britain-is-facing-a-tsunami-of-pensioner-poverty-says-kendall\">Britain is facing a ‘tsunami’ of pensioner poverty, says Kendall</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:28:15.564Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68c90a1e8f084793c7c162af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T07:07:01.551Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK jobs data: political reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The UK’s new Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has spotted some bright spots in today’s labour market reports.</strong></p> <p>He points to a drop in the economic inactivity rate (people neither in work nor looking for a job), which dipped by 0.02 percentage points over the last quarter to 21.1%.</p> <p><strong>McFadden </strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Today’s figures show signs of progress with economic inactivity and redundancies continuing to fall.</p> <p>“But we must futureproof our workforce by giving people the opportunities and skills they need to secure the jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>“It is vital that our £240 million Get Britain Working plan is felt by people across the country, whether it’s through targeted support for young people entering the workforce, or joining up work, health and skills support.</p> <p>“The true strength of the UK’s economy lies in the British people, which is why we are unlocking opportunity in every part of the country to drive forward economic growth under our plan for change.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Daisy</strong> <strong>Cooper</strong>, the <strong>Liberal</strong> <strong>Democrat</strong> Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. </p> <p><strong>Cooper</strong> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c904a68f084793c7c16289\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T06:47:12.509Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JLR production pause extended until Wednesday 24 September</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jaguar Land Rover has extended the shutdown of its car production for another week, as it continues to reel from a disruptive cyber attack.</strong></p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> says it told its staff, suppliers and partners today that it has extended the current pause in our production until Wednesday 24 September.</p> <p><strong>JLR</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p> <p>We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company’s factory lines have already been frozen for two weeks, since JLR’s manufacturing and retailing activities were “severely disrupted” by a cyber incident.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyber-attack-has-affected-some-data\">Last week, JLR revealed the hack had affected ‘some’ of its data</a>.</p> <p>The disruption is hurting the company’s suppliers;

So for us to be on 12 points now is so much more than I expected, especially when we had so many changes in the squad. I think we can do better but not every time we are going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/25/newcastle-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">face Newcastle away</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal at home</a>.”</p> <p>Slot has included Alexander Isak in the squad for the first time after leaving him out for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/14/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">victory over Burnley on Sunday</a>. The striker was not deemed able to play twice in a week after missing pre-season and the head coach wanted him available for the start of the European campaign.</p> <p>“It is 100% sure he will not play 90 minutes, but he is part of the squad,” Slot said. “So it is already a Champions League game to look forward to but if people look forward to his playing time that could mean that could happen tomorrow as well.”</p> <p>Virgil van Dijk has played against Isak numerous times and talked up the Swede’s ability on Tuesday. “He’s a clinical finisher. I think if you look at his finishing skills, heading left, right, top corners, he’s the complete striker at the moment and same you can say from Hugo [Ekitiké]. Very good, very eager, obviously the quality he’s been showing already since, I think, the first session.”</p> <p>Van Dijk said he had spoken to Isak during the international break. “For him it’s obviously about getting as fit as possible, as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, how we do set pieces. So it’s been a good week for him and let’s see tomorrow.”</p> <p>Liverpool have ambitions to challenge for the Champions League after being knocked out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/11/liverpool-psg-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">Paris Saint-Germain on penalties</a> in the last 16 last season. Atlético’s visit is the start of a difficult-looking league stage for Slot’s side, who then travel to Galatasaray and will also face Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, PSV and Inter before Christmas.</p> <p>“I’m confident that we can show Europe that we are a fantastic team, but you have to work for it,” Van Dijk said. “It’s all about the work that you put in, obviously on the pitch but off the pitch as well, in order to be at your best.”</p>",

<strong>Marco Rubio</strong> said as he headed to Qatar on Tuesday that he would ask it to stay on as a mediator in Israel’s war on Gaza, a week after Israeli airstrikes against Hamas leaders in Doha.</p> \n  <p>Rubio expressed pessimism about a ceasefire deal as he flew out from Tel Aviv amid the IDF’s intensified bombardment of Gaza but told reporters that Qatar uniquely could help, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> \n  <p>“We’re going to ask Qatar to continue to do what they’ve done, and we appreciate very much, and that is, play a constructive role in trying to bring this to an end,” Rubio told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.</p> \n  <p>“Obviously they have to decide if they want to do that after last week or not, but we want them to know that if there’s any country in the world that could help end this through a negotiation, it’s Qatar.”</p> \n  <p>Rubio said the US would work with Qatar to finalise a defence agreement soon despite the Israeli military action last week.</p> \n  <p>“If any country in the world can help mediate it, Qatar is the one. They’re the ones that can do it,” Rubio said while departing Tel Aviv for Doha.</p> \n  <p>“We have a close partnership with the Qataris. In fact, we have an enhanced defence cooperation agreement, which we’ve been working on, we’re on the verge of finalising,” Rubio said, without elaborating.</p> \n  <p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> told reporters in Washington that prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> “won’t be hitting” Qatar again.</p> \n  <p>Rubio made no such comments in <strong>Israel</strong>.

It was the first time a president has pursued such action since the central bank’s founding in 1913.

    "content": "<p>Robert Redford, who has died aged 89, was the golden boy of American cinema for more than 50 years. </p> <p>In one respect, with his blond good looks, he conformed to a mythic Californian stereotype, or what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dustinhoffman\">Dustin Hoffman</a> called a “walking surfboard”. However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a>, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p>    <p>Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of an accountant with Standard Oil, and his wife, Martha (nee Hart). The family moved to Van Nuys, California, where Robert went to Van Nuys high school. He was blessed early on with a graceful athleticism, excelling in swimming, tennis, football and baseball, the last of which won him a scholarship to the University of Colorado, where he could also indulge his love for climbing and skiing.</p> <p>But he soon became frustrated by what he called “test-tube athletes”. As the character of the Olympic skier that he played in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdd7W_h3VK4\">Downhill Racer</a> (1969) says: ‘“I never knew what it was like to just enjoy a sport. I was always out there grovelling to win. You begin to fear not winning.”</p> <p>When his lack of attendance at baseball practice led to him losing his scholarship, he left for Europe in 1957. Because he had displayed a certain talent as a caricaturist in high school, he did what all hopeful American artists did: he went to paint in Paris before being forced into the realisation that, as an artist, he was mediocre. On his return to the US, he married his girlfriend, Lola Van Wagenen, in 1958 and studied scenic design at the Pratt Institute in New York.</p> <p>When Redford was told that to really understand the principles of scenic design, he must put himself in the actor’s place, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. “At the Academy I got the space and the opportunity to expand and form myself as an actor, but I didn’t learn to act,” he recalled.</p> <p>None the less, in 1959, he made his professional stage debut on Broadway with a small role as a basketball player in Tall Story, which he repeated uncredited in the feature film version starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\">Jane Fonda</a> the following year. During the try-out run for The Highest Tree (1959), a short-lived play about a nuclear scientist, his first child, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome.</p> <p>He made it big on Broadway in Norman Krasna’s Sunday in New York (1961) and even bigger in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/neil-simon-obituary\">Neil Simon</a>’s hit comedy Barefoot in the Park (1963), which he reprised in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY-uQehpXf0\">screen version</a> opposite Fonda in 1967. He remained in the play for the first year of its four-year run, but never worked in the theatre again.</p> <p>At the same time, he was racking up numerous TV credits, including the callow Don Parritt in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sidney-lumet\">Sidney Lumet</a>’s production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eugene-o-neill\">Eugene O’Neill</a>’s The Iceman Cometh (1960) and a memorable appearance as the Angel of Death in an exceptional 1962 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/18/twilight-zone-your-next-boxset\">Twilight Zone</a> episode called Nothing in the Dark.</p>    <p>Redford’s first credited film role was in the untrumpeted War Hunt (1962), an off-beat little picture, shot in 15 days, in which Pollack also made his screen debut as a performer. They played members of a platoon in Korea, one of whom (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/jul/26/nightmare-on-elm-streets-john-saxon-a-life-in-pictures\">John Saxon</a>) is schizophrenic. He goes out on lone missions and kills the enemy with a stiletto. Redford’s character tries to rescue an orphan from Saxon’s influence.</p> <p>It was three years before he returned to the big screen, gaining some attention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/23/obituary-robert-mulligan\">Robert Mulligan’s</a> Inside Daisy Clover (1965), in which he played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/20/biography.film\">Natalie Wood</a>’s egotistical, bisexual matinee idol husband and for which he won the Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer.</p> <p>This promise was fulfilled in his following films, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/29/arthur-penn-obituary\">Arthur Penn</a>’s steamy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EbbnP9dBmk\">The Chase</a> (1966), in which Redford played an escaped convict whom the fair-minded sheriff (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Marlon Brando</a>) tries to protect from being lynched by the inhabitants of a small Texas town. Although the role required Redford to spend much of the film running through rice fields, he opted for that rather than playing the sheriff, the part he was offered originally.</p> <p>He seemed incredibly relaxed and confident in the early stages of his career, rejecting two roles offered to him by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a> – the younger man in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (eventually played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/24/george-segal-obituary\">George Segal</a>), and Benjamin Braddock in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-graduate-review-anne-bancroft-dustin-hoffman\">The Graduate</a>, because he felt too old for the part, even though he and Hoffman, who made his name from the part, were almost the same age. He also turned down the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johncassavetes\">John Cassavetes</a> role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski\">Roman Polanski</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rosemary-s-baby\">Rosemary’s Baby</a>.</p> <p>Instead, he preferred to co-star with Wood again in Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JX84nAZDX4\">This Property Is Condemned</a> (1966), based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a> play, as a mysterious railway official. Next came Barefoot in the Park, and then one of his best-known roles, Sundance <strong>–</strong> a role passed over by Brando, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/warren-beatty\">Warren Beatty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> – opposite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/27/paulnewman.usa1\">Paul Newman</a>’s Butch Cassidy in one of the most successful westerns ever.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/30/guardianobituaries.film\">George Roy Hill</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> (1969) created at its core an irresistible chemistry between its two male leads as charming outlaws, leading to a string of buddy movies, including the equally successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/22/the-sting-best-picture-oscar-1974\">The Sting</a> (1973) with the same director and stars, this time playing scam artists in 1930s Chicago.</p> <p>Between the two hit movies, Redford made several films, the best being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/19/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Michael Ritchie</a>’s satirical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/26/how-hollywood-predicted-the-year-of-the-accidental-politician\">The Candidate</a> (1972), about a presidential campaign, in which he was well cast in the vapid title role, and Pollack’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=292Oouog8fI\">The Way We Were</a> (1973). The latter, an odd couple romantic comedy with Redford as an upper-crust Wasp who does not take politics seriously, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbra-streisand\">Barbra Streisand</a> as a working-class Jewish leftist uncompromising in her political beliefs, saw them both performing well within their comfort zones.</p> <p>By the end of the 60s, Redford had become one of the world’s top film stars and box-office attractions, with carefully chosen projects to keep alive his screen persona in glossy Hollywood star vehicles. Among the exceptions were movies that satisfied his liberal leanings, especially <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-alan-pakula-1186240.html\">Alan Pakula</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\">Watergate</a> exposé, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/10/all-the-presidents-men-watergate-conspiracy-richard-nixon-woodward-bernstein-redford-hoffman\">All the President’s Men</a> (1976).</p> <p>The perspicacious Redford had bought an option on the book by the Washington Post journalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/carl-bernstein\">Carl Bernstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/26/pressandpublishing.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">Bob Woodward</a> prior to its publication in 1974 for $450,000. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/25/william-goldman-screenwriter-interview\">William Goldman</a>, who had written three buddy movies in a row for Redford – Butch Cassidy, The Hot Rock (with Segal, 1972) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfZhXhCGwEA\">The Great Waldo Pepper</a> (with Bo Svenson, 1975) – was hired to supply another one for the star and Hoffman, delivering a sort of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Bring Down the Government”, as one Washington Post wit described it.</p>    <p>Of the two leads, Redford had the edge, managing to combine a dry humour, a convincing intelligence and a determined idealism. According to Hoffman, the reason the film was a top earner was because “it is what the public always wanted: that beautiful Wasp finally wound up with a nice Jewish boy”.</p> <p>In the 80s, Redford gradually scaled down his acting, appearing in only four films, having taken up producing and directing. At the same time, he established the Sundance Institute on his 7,000-acre estate in Provo, Utah, providing workshops, development resources and support to promising independent film-makers. </p> <p>In 1978, Redford co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival\">Sundance film festival,</a> held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah every January as a shop window for independent cinema, and remained a godfather to it. A passionate environmentalist, he also co-founded the Institute for Resource Management, a forum to encourage land developers and environmentalists to work together.</p> <p>In later acting assignments, he was shown in a noble, almost saintly, light, consistently backlit to turn his golden hair into a saintly halo: as a prison reformer in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVzHtmJR7g\">Brubaker</a> (1980), a mythical baseball player in The Natural (1984), and the English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (though there was no attempt to get the accent),the lover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/29/margaret-atwood-isak-dinesen\">Karen Blixen</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/reel-history-out-of-africa\">Out of Africa</a> (1985).</p> <p>Redford’s first film as a director, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKkcyK1VpGY\">Ordinary People</a> (1980), was a middle-class family drama, elegantly shot though not very original, with a sentimental father-son solution. Nevertheless, the film won Oscars for best picture and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Trc1lkc6Lo\">best director</a> – Redford went on to win an honorary Oscar, too, in 2002 – as well as best supporting actor, for Timothy Hutton, and best adapted screenplay. Its success encouraged Redford to continue directing over the next decades.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuaKVk4hNAY\">The Milagro Beanfield War</a> (1988) was a homespun fable of a New Mexican farmer deflecting water from a housing development to start his own beanfield. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7yeXtBQMU\">A River Runs Through It</a> (1992), shot in Montana (Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for his cinematography), used fly-fishing as a metaphor for life in an understated way; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/dec/14/quiz-show-robert-redford\">Quiz Show</a> (1994) was a gripping account of a television scandal in 50s America, when a winning contestant of a popular programme was exposed as a fraud.</p> <p>Redford directed himself for the first time in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_1dKoCQlxY\">The Horse Whisperer</a> (1998), as a Montana cowboy who cures traumatised horses, a role that fitted him as snugly as his faded denims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">The Legend of Bagger Vance </a>(2000), continued his almost mystic interest in sport with a nostalgic look at golf between the wars, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/thriller.tomcruise\">Lions for Lambs </a>(2007) was a flabbily liberal and verbose response to the Iraq war.</p> <p>He starred in and directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/ricki-flash-wolfpack-company-you-keep-heist-on-the-beach-review\">The Company You Keep</a> (2012), a well-intentioned political drama on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jul/04/artsfeatures2\">Weather Underground</a> 30 years after their terrorist activities. Yet, though one would be hard put to call Redford an auteur, there is no denying that his choice of films reflected his political views and his passion for the American west.</p> <p>From the 90s, the reasons for some of his acting choices were a trifle less clear. In Adrian Lyne’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kA0MydxWUo\">Indecent Proposal</a> (1993), Redford’s character, admitting to advanced middle-age, offers to pay $1m to sleep with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/demi-moore\">Demi Moore</a>, with her husband’s approval. He finally gave in to advancing years at the age of 68 and played a crusty and grizzled rancher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/24/features\">Lasse Hallstrom</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/16/drama\">An Unfinished Life</a> (2005), the sort of role Newman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/clinteastwood\">Clint Eastwood</a> had been playing for years.</p> <p>Never straying too far from his persona of dignified masculinity, Redford continued to be active into his 80s. His solo performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/26/all-is-lost-review\">All Is Lost</a> (2013) as a castaway seaman trying to survive was a tour de force, while he demonstrated his fitness in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/a-walk-in-the-woods-review-robert-redford-bill-bryson\">A Walk in the Woods</a> (2015), and his integrity as the TV anchor Don Rather in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/truth-review-cate-blanchett-60-minutes-george-w-bush-war-record\">Truth</a> (2015). His last substantial role was as the real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker in the comedy drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/06/the-old-man-the-gun-review-robert-redford-sissy-spacek-casey-affleck\">The Old Man &amp; the Gun</a> (2018).</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, an artist, whom he married in 2009 after a long relationship, and three children, Shauna, James and Amy, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1985.</p> <p>• Robert Redford, actor, producer and director, born 18 August 1936; died 16 September 2025</p> <p>• Ronald Bergan died in 2020</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jay Miller’s account of teaching philosophy in prison is powerful and welcome (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/09/teaching-philosophy-in-prison-college-students-inmates\">‘You want to talk about a world of lies?’ Teaching philosophy in prison, 9 September</a>). This kind of “public philosophy”, which includes the excluded, is of profound value, he&nbsp;argues. Remarkably, philosophy in prisons is “A kaleidoscopic assortment of jokes, stories, anecdotes and philosophical insights …” This picture is familiar for the UK charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.philosophyinprison.com/\">Philosophy in&nbsp;Prison</a><em>. </em></p> <p>The puzzle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56yN2zHtofM\">Trigger’s broom</a>, for example, can generate a joyous discussion of identity, time, the rights of work, relativism, freedom and responsibility, and happiness –&nbsp;where the whole room is focused&nbsp;and participating.</p> <p>For such intractable questions, no one in the room has a definitive answer, neither the “professional” philosophers, nor those wondering about Trigger for the first time. So philosophical discussion has an equalising effect – everyone is puzzled, no one is disqualified from having a view, nor from arguing it well. It seems obvious that this kind of work is important for its own sake as well as for its effect on&nbsp;participants. But one feature of the prison population in the UK that Miller does not address directly is the high levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons/prison-education-a-review-of-reading-education-in-prisons\">functional illiteracy</a>.</p> <p>Offering prisoners university courses works for those who read and feel comfortable with writing. But philosophy can be done just by conversation, to include both those with high levels of education and those who have little. Anyone may participate; disagreement itself generates a toleration that manifests itself on the wing; and educational doors open afterwards. Philosophy in Prison does philosophy just by talking, in the anomalous public space of prison, and it matters&nbsp;for&nbsp;anyone in the room.<br><strong>Mary Margaret McCabe</strong><br><em>Professor of </em><em>ancient </em><em>philosophy </em><em>emerita, King’s College London; </em><em>Chair of trustees, Philosophy in Prison</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”</p> <p>Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described by Sydney Pollack, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”</p> <p>According to F Scott Fitzgerald’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-obituary\">Robert Redford obituary</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c993938f0862eec18cf422\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T16:44:10.087Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Film director James Gunn shared a tribute to Redford on Instagram and wrote: “I grew up with his [Redford’s] movies: his quiet, unforced performances and ever-present grace.

It’s got some great 1970s Hollywood moments: doubts about Redford as leading man, Steve McQueen bailing on the project over who would get top billing and daft amounts of money being thrown around by inexperienced producers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Newman was Goldman’s choice from the moment the film was bought, but the casting for Sundance was trickier. Fox initially wanted Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in a 1958 western called <em>Cowboy </em>along with Glenn Ford. Lemmon was not keen on spending a lot of time riding horses again and told them he was not interested. The studio then turned their attention to Steve McQueen and although he liked the script, he dropped out, reportedly in a disagreement over who got top billing.</p> <p>Newman’s wife Joanne Woodward suggested 32-year-old Redford, who had appeared in a few films but was better known as a stage actor. Zanuck, who was a production manager on the film, thought Redford was too lightweight for the role and changed his mind only after seeing raw footage of Newman and Redford together and realising that they had a true chemistry on screen.</p> <p>“I wasn’t that well known at the time and although my agency thought I would be right for the part, 20th Century didn’t want me,”<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/robert-redford-dead-sundance-kid-age-cause-b2582661.html\"> Redford </a>told a television interviewer more than 40 years later. “They wanted Steve McQueen.

I thought he was great.”</p> <p>Redford’s stance on Trump changed over the years. In 2015 he told Larry King: “Look he’s got such a big foot in his mouth, I’m not sure you’re going to get it out. But on the other hand, I’m glad he’s in there.”</p>    <p>He added: “I’m glad he’s in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that’s very needed. Because on the other side, it’s so bland, it’s so boring, it’s so empty.”</p> <p>Four years later during the calls for Trump’s impeachment, Redford’s opinion shifted. “It is painfully clear we have a president who degrades everything he touches,” he wrote in a Washington Post comment piece. “A person who does not understand (or care?) that his duty is to defend our democracy.”</p> <p>He expanded on those thoughts later in the same year, admitting he wanted to “give the guy a chance” when Trump was first elected.

But it was his first pairing with Sting co-star Paul Newman that distils the performer’s essence. Although the movie is unable to fess up to its bromantic longings – did any woman in a buddy movie ever look more like a gooseberry than poor Katharine Ross? – it’s still worth seeing for Redford’s sunny charm. Even then, it seemed to trouble him faintly, as though he was worried we might take him for a himbo. The studio did. “He’s just another California blond,” said one executive. “Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him.” But Newman helped win him the part. Redford got a shock when he saw the first cut. “I said: ‘What the hell is that song doing in there? Raindrops? It’s not even raining. On a bicycle?’”</p> </blockquote> <p>The full top ten is:</p> <p>10. Brubaker (1980)</p> <p>9. The Twilight Zone – “Nothing in the Dark” (1962)</p> <p>8. The Great Gatsby (1974)</p> <p>7.

It spans his early career as an unlikely star and includes his honorary Oscar and the award of his Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p> <p>There are a couple of entries that cover his collaborations with Paul Newman, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (poster above). Here’s an excerpt from Scott Tobias’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford\">50th anniversary piece</a> from 2019:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Right away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford’s taciturn sharpshooter. But he’s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn’t have the stomach for violence; it’s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he’s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He’s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him.</p> <p>Audiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/true-grit-john-wayne-1969-henry-hathaway\">True Grit</a> had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre’s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s. With Ross at the center of a love triangle between friends, the film attempted to bring Jules and Jim to the American mainstream, taking a lesson from the French new wave on how to revivify old Hollywood craft.</p> <p>It still works spectacularly well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full gallery is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-a-life-in-pictures\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c964268f0862eec18cf0e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbradshaw\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T13:22:38.305Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Robert Redford began his career as a blond bombshell at a time when American cinema favoured grit, then turned into a supremely assured director and unlikely keeper of the indie flame, writes Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw in his appreciation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, it wasn’t cool for star actors to be good-looking. The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a> was very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.</p> <p>When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> in 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustaches, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the Jazz Age conmen caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs.

We don’t have enough to support everybody.”</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to three food business owners in LA about the summer of Ice, and how it’s affected their families and businesses.</p> <h2>Juan Carlos Guerra, Taqueria Frontera</h2> <p>It’s Los Angeles … you drive anywhere on the street, you’re going to see pop-ups. You’re going to see street vendors. But it just seemed like a ghost town during that time. No one was out on the street.</p> <p>I was going to open the new Silver Lake location of Taqueria Frontera at the beginning of June. And then the raids happened. It didn’t seem like we should have a celebration or a grand opening.</p> <p>I reached out to Javier Cabral from [the hyperlocal news site] LA Taco, and I said to him, “I want to try to help out. Whatever I can do. Do you know a good organization?” And he said: “Oh, yeah. <a href=\"https://mycielo.org/\">CIELO</a> is a great organization.”</p> <p>I talked to someone at CIELO, Comunidades Indígenas en Liderazgo (Indigenous Communities in Leadership). I was just like: “Taco Tuesday is usually a thing. Is it okay if I set up something saying that all proceeds of our trompo [taco] – which is what we sell the most – is going to be donated towards fundraising for CIELO so they can help immigrant families during this time?”</p> <p>We did Taco Tuesday with a purpose, and we ended up raising $4,000 from selling the trompo that day alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues</p> <footer> <cite>Bulmaro, street vendor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone was pretty supportive about it. And not just that day – a lot of people would come in just to check up on us, on my employees, see how they’re doing, how they’re feeling. There’s no way you could live in Los Angeles without being affected by this. And a lot of my clients were like: “I can’t believe this is going on.” Who doesn’t have a friend or family member or co-worker that isn’t undocumented here in Los Angeles?</p> <p>Street vendors are back out now and more people are outside eating. But I think that it’s still in the back of their minds. Could this happen at any time again? Right now it’s pretty calm, but what happens a month from now if they decide to do it again?</p> <h2>Bulmaro, street vendor</h2> <p>When we started the business, there weren’t many jobs out there. We knew how to make tamales, which is what we sell. Due to the lack of jobs and opportunities, we decided to do what we know how to do. From there, business grew and we started getting more clients, little by little. It’s our sole source of income.</p> <p>Because of the raids, everything stopped. We stopped selling for about a month, without working or anything. We just started working again a little more about two weeks ago. A lot of people don’t go out to buy things anymore because they’re scared. Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues.</p> <p>We haven’t had phone orders, either. We just bring the day’s supply, and sometimes we come back home with tamales or with atol that didn’t sell. It’s never going to be the same as before the raids.</p>    <p>It’s me, my wife and another employee – three of us depend on the business. There’s nothing we can do, we have to keep working. We need to pay rent and bills, even though we’re going outside with fear. There’s no other way. The rent isn’t going to wait. The bills, and the food we need to buy, aren’t going to wait either.</p> <h2>Alejandra Rodriguez, Alex Foods and Cemitas Poblanas</h2> <p>A lot of our customers stopped coming. They were scared because a lot of them are Latino. Even at the local restaurants in the city of West Hollywood, [the workers] have their visas to be here, but they were still scared because of everything that was going on. They were saying that even if you had a visa, even if you had permission to be here, everybody was still getting kicked out. Our sales dropped more than 70%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/13/ice-immigration-raids-food-labor\">How US immigration raids hurt summer pleasures, from berries to barbecues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even on the street, there was nobody walking, nobody coming.

And luckily, we had a little bit of money saved up. Usually, when we leave on trips, customers will still call us to place orders. But no, the whole 10 days we were gone, we didn’t go to work. We didn’t get any calls or people asking us when we were going to come back.</p> <p>I had to let one of my two employees go. I couldn’t afford it anymore. And we’ve just slowly been climbing back. We have customers from the local car washes, and they told us that Ice actually got there at that car wash and took about four people. People are still aware. People are still scared. Any time they see a police officer pass by or a sheriff’s department or just somebody, they would flinch.</p> <p>People are just trying to get to work and come back.

The crowd loudly chanted the name. The focus of this acclamation was not Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, the organiser of the so-called “free speech” march in central London last Saturday.</p> \n<p>They were instead shouting themselves hoarse for Charlie Kirk, the murdered political activist from Cook County in the US state of Illinois.</p> \n<p>It is unlikely that many of the 110,000 to 150,000 protesters estimated to have been on the streets last weekend, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">what turned out to be the largest rally of its type in British history</a>,<strong> </strong>knew much about Kirk before his death at the hands of a gunman at Utah Valley University.</p> \n<p>The UK version of Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which claims to be the “largest Conservative student movement” in the US, has never really taken off in Britain.</p> \n<p>But they were moved to cheer him on Saturday. Clips of an almost entirely white and predominantly male crowd of Britons chanting the first name of the murdered 31-year-old were lapped up on social media accounts said to be US-based, as was the minute’s silence afterwards.</p> \n<p>“Thousands of British patriots just fell silent in honor of Charlie Kirk in London,” tweeted Eric Daugherty, an assistant news director at the conservative Florida’s Voice website (“Honest political reporting to Florida, minus the mainstream talking points.”)</p> \n<p>It is said that when America coughs, Britain catches a cold.</p> \n<p>The reality with this strain of politics is that there is something of a feedback loop between the US and the UK that is proving mutually beneficial to both sides, said Prof Paul Jackson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pride-in-prejudice-9781526156723/\">Pride in Prejudice: Understanding Britain’s Extreme Right</a>.</p> \n<p>Kirk may not have been a household name in the UK but his murder offered validation for a view that a certain outlook on life is under threat. In turn, the scenes on Saturday provided evidence of the righteousness of the cause back in the US.</p> \n<p>There is history to this mutually enforcing exchange of ideas on the extreme right, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>A certain type of US political thought has never travelled well across the Atlantic, notably the Ku Klux Klan, which grew after the civil war in the late 1860s, said Jackson.</p> \n<p>But other ideas have thrived in the past as they do today, including those contained in Madison Grant’s 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, which influenced some European white supremacists, and Henry Ford’s The International Jew.</p> \n<p>It has not all been one way. The Blood &amp; Honour movement, founded by British neo-Nazi and white power music pioneer Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987, led to the birth of Blood &amp; Honour American Division and Blood &amp; Honour Council US.</p> \n<p>That was the analogue age, though.</p> \n<p>In the digital era, particularly in the so-called “counter-jihad” space that now dominates what is loosely termed the far right, the mutual reinforcement of messages is done in real time. Stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another.</p> \n<p>Kirk himself was one of those who picked up on the case of Lucy Connolly, the 42-year-old English woman –married to a Conservative councillor – who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for calling for hotels that were housing asylum seekers to be burned down during last summer’s riots.<strong> </strong>(She was released in August after serving less than half her sentence.)</p> \n<p>“Every day people say: ‘Well someone should go kill Charlie Kirk.’ I don’t like it, but that is protected speech,” he told GB News. “In America, we care what you do and not what you say.”</p> \n<p>It was of a piece with the general claim that free speech is under threat in the UK, confirmed in the mind of the likes of JD Vance by the UK’s Online Safety Act, aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content, which the US vice-president claims has put Britain on a “very dark path”.</p> \n<p>The amplification of certain causes, the repetition of choice phrases, cannot be said to be highly organised, but it is nonetheless powerful.</p> \n<p>The Infowars website, founded by the prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, promoted Robinson’s content about the rally on Saturday, but also that of a series of obscure accounts on X, said to be based in both the UK and the US.</p> \n<p>“Breaking: London falls silent for fallen hero Charlie Kirk,” said one such account with 335,700 followers that described itself as a defender of western values and culture. “The British media hated him. The British people certainly didn’t.”</p> \n<p>Another account promoted by Jones’s site was that of Naomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer linked to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, who is known for her climate change denial and promotion of “great replacement theory” tropes.</p> \n<p>She tweeted images from the rally to her 436,700 followers that included the words: “White children will grow up as patriots from now on. White guilt is over.”</p> \n<p>Brigitte Gabriel, founder of the anti-Muslim movement Act for America, which claims to have 1,000 local chapters across the US, posted on X: “Don’t let the media downplay how massive this is. Millions of patriots in the UK are standing up for free speech.”</p> \n<p>Then there is Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">who appeared via videolink at Saturday’s rally</a>. It would be difficult to overplay the importance to Robinson of the support of one of the world’s richest men, according to analysts including the Hope Not Hate anti-extremist organisation.</p> \n<p>In lifting the ban on Robinson’s content on X and through his own misleading posts framing him as a free speech warrior persecuted by the state, Musk gave the activist a vital leg-up, it is argued.</p> \n<p>Robinson, a former member of the racist British National party, who has a string of convictions to his name including for assault, using a fake passport, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, is said to have been able to build upon his profile in the US, stir up protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers while pushing anti-immigrant messages that circle around a supposed threat of Islamisation to the UK.</p> \n<p>“When you hear people talk about the special relationship between America and Great Britain, this is the special relationship that you’re seeing here,” Robinson said at the rally.</p> \n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd, in turn.</p> \n<p>Musk is not yet believed to have directly funded anyone in the UK, although he reportedly flirted with offering money to Reform, the rising political party on the right that is led by Nigel Farage. But such transatlantic relationships do exist, albeit they tend to remain below the radar. It is a murky soup – but some of the chunkier players can be made out.</p> \n<p>One is the US tech billionaire Robert Shillman, known as Dr Bob, who in 2018 financed a fellowship that helped pay for Robinson to be employed by the rightwing Canadian media website, Rebel Media, now called Rebel News, on a salary of about £5,000 a month.</p> \n<p>Other Shillman fellows have included Katie Hopkins, the English former reality TV star who compared migrants to cockroaches, and Laura Loomer, the American conspiracy theorist referred to by some as the president’s “de facto national security adviser”.</p> \n<p>The rightwing Middle East Forum thinktank, led by the neoconservative academic Daniel Pipes, has paid for foreign speakers to attend Robinson rallies in the past, in addition to funding the activist’s legal defence.</p> \n<p>There are laws against foreign donations in both the US and the UK but the far-right echo chamber is also clearly a useful tool for those seeking electoral success on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>Trump has had no qualms about bouncing off certain British causes, sometimes unadvisedly. He said he was prepared to apologise in 2018 when he retweeted posts from Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP. But he is notably cautious about certain characters.</p> \n<p>Trump, who will be in the UK for a state visit this week, did not comment on social media about Saturday’s rally. He appears to prefer his outriders to do the work at times, including his son.</p> \n<p>When the rightwing activist Kurt Schlichter claimed – falsely – on X that Robinson had been arrested for reporting on a court case in May 2018, Donald Trump Jr retweeted it, writing: “Reason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.”</p> \n<p>In the UK, Farage, who successfully fought for decades for the UK to leave the European Union and is today riding high in the polls with his anti-immigration populism, has sought to keep a sterile gap between himself and Robinson, who he fears is beyond the pale for much of the British public.</p> \n<p>He steps carefully in the digital space, seeking support but without getting too close to the most strident actors, including those in the US. He is notably quite loth to associate himself too much with Trump these days when he is at home in the UK, given the US president’s poor approval ratings among the British public.</p> \n<p>But his long-standing ties to the Make America Great Again movement remain financially advantageous. This week, Farage apologised for breaching parliamentary rules by failing to register a trip to Florida to headline a fundraising event for Trump. He had been the main speaker at the $500-a-head Republican party dinner in Tallahassee in March.</p> \n<p>Farage hopes to benefit from the promotion of anti-immigrant themes in the digital world, including from US commentators, without putting off those with more mainstream outlooks, say insiders. It will be a difficult trick to get away with – as Musk’s criticism of Farage at the start of the year over his lack of support for Robinson illustrated.</p> \n<p>“British people are kind of looking for an international source of inspiration,” said Jackson. “[Then] some of the reason why somebody like Nigel Farage or Tommy Robinson might be of particular interest in the US is because they’ve had a lot of success in their own terms.</p> \n<p>“Tommy Robinson’s social media profile of the last few years has been highly impactful, even more so since [Musk] reversing his ban from Twitter. Nigel Farage’s impact on Britain shortly before Trump’s first presidency can be seen as perhaps providing some blueprints about how to have impact.”</p> \n<p>Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s long-standing press adviser until he left Reform earlier this year, said he believed the American interest in shaping British politics was also instinctive.</p> \n<p>“Trump sees the UK as the spiritual home of the US,” he said. “He sees our traditional political and legal traditions as the spiritual background to America’s right.</p> \n<p>“Musk certainly feels that way. He sees the UK as the spiritual homeland of the concepts of the American Declaration of Independence and its bill of rights and all the rest of it. This is where freedom was born, right? It’s like losing a great-uncle if it falls.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Big pharmaceutical companies have ditched or paused nearly £2bn in planned UK investments so far this year, causing “suffering” to patients, as ministers gear up for discussions with Donald Trump amid a row over drug pricing.</p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-sciences-sector-plan/life-sciences-sector-plan\">plan for the life science sector</a>, a key pillar of the economy, has been thrown into disarray, after US drugmaker MSD’s shock announcement last Wednesday that it would scrap its £1bn London research centre. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/astrazeneca-pauses-200m-investment-in-cambridge-research-site\">AstraZeneca decided to halt a planned £200m expansion</a> of its research facilities in Cambridge.</p> <p>Combined with a scrapped project by AstraZeneca in Liverpool and a shelved Eli Lilly lab in London, four projects worth more than £1.8bn have been pulled or paused this year. In total, decisions over 13 major projects or companies have damaged the UK’s pharma industry since 2022, also including site closures and stock market delistings.</p> <p>Pharma companies have accused the government of not spending enough on new medicines, arguing that there is little incentive for them to develop drugs and test them in a country that does not value innovation sufficiently.</p> <p>More recriminations are expected when MPs on the science, innovation and technology committee question MSD’s UK and Ireland managing director, Ben Lucas, about its decision on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>He will appear alongside AstraZeneca UK president Tom Keith-Roach, Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry chief executive Richard Torbett and representatives of the government, including the science minister Lord Vallance, a former GSK executive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\" data-alt=\"Pharma cancellations map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pharma_site_closures/giv-32554OyNrEsy5J0Y3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens, asked the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d15efe-e802-497a-a995-87ca7fdcbe7b\">to offer drug companies a better deal on pricing</a> when the two met at a private dinner in London recently, the Financial Times reported. The intervention came before Trump’s visit to the UK this week. The US president has criticised foreign nations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/01/australia-pbs-medicine-drugs-prices-trump-tariffs\">“freeloading on US innovation”</a>. Drug prices are much higher in the US and companies have been accused of “price gouging” in the past.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Guy Oliver, the UK head of the US drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), told the Times that, because of “chronic underinvestment” in medicines, the US drugmaker had cancelled 34 partnerships with the NHS in the past year. “There is a human cost to all of this. Patients are really suffering, and have been suffering for many, many years now,” he said.</p> <p>A BMS spokesperson said: <em>“</em>Bristol Myers Squibb agrees with the US administration that the UK pays too little for medicines. As a result of today’s commercial and policy environment in the UK, we have materially reduced the size of our UK organisation over the last four years, and we continue to evaluate our level of investment in the country.”</p> <p>Drugmakers have become more vocal over the UK’s shortcomings since months-long <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/media/news/2025/august/accelerated-review-of-vpag-concludes-without-agreement/\">negotiations over drug pricing</a> broke down in late August, when the health secretary, Wes Streeting, gave companies an ultimatum over his latest “generous” offer – but was rejected.</p>    <p>This means that the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing, access and growth, under which pharma companies pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">continues at a rate the industry says is “unsustainable”</a>. The minimum <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/publications/creating-the-conditions-for-investment-and-growth/\">clawback rate of 23.5% for newer medicines is much higher</a> than payment rates in other European countries.</p> <p>A government spokesperson indicated it was willing to reopen talks but stuck to its previous offer, saying: “Our door remains open to future engagement.”</p> <p>MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would discontinue all research and development activities in the UK, which means 125 scientists based at the Francis Crick Institute and the London BioScience Innovation Centre will lose their jobs. </p>    <p>Also last week, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly said its planned London Gateway Lab, part of a £279m investment, was on hold, “as we are awaiting more clarity around the UK life sciences environment”.</p> <p>Britain’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, which was at the forefront of the government’s efforts to make Covid vaccines available during the pandemic, already pulled the plug on the £450m expansion of its vaccine site in Speke in Liverpool in January after failing to agree a state support package.</p> <p>The French pharma group Sanofi’s UK head of market access, Paul Naish, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">has said substantial investment is now on hold</a>. “This is an intolerable situation for too many [patients] in this country and that is why government needs to work with the sector,” he said.</p> <p>The Swiss drugmaker Novartis is also holding off future investments in UK manufacturing or research, it is understood. Over the past 16 years, it has scaled back its UK operations from seven sites and more than 4,000 employees to one site in London housing 1,200 staff. </p>    <p>Meanwhile, Germany’s BioNTech said its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/1-billion-biontech-investment-sets-way-for-jobs-growth-breakthroughs\">£1bn, 10-year partnership with the UK government</a>, aimed at speeding up trials of its cancer medications, remained on track. Several hundred patients have been treated with experimental cancer immunotherapies through the collaboration, and new research centres are planned in London and Cambridge.</p> <p>The US biotech Moderna, known for its Covid vaccine, opened a new vaccine manufacturing site in Harwell, Oxfordshire in May.</p> <h2><strong>Scrapped/paused investments, delistings and site closures in the UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>September</strong> AstraZeneca pauses £200m research lab in Cambridge (1,000 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September </strong>Merck scraps £1bn London research centre (125 jobs)</p> <p><strong>September</strong> Eli Lilly pauses London Gateway lab, part of £279m investment</p> <p><strong>2025</strong><strong>-26</strong> Haleon closing Maidenhead site (435 jobs)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Indivior: based in Slough, delisted from London Stock Exchange (LSE)</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Verona Pharma: based in London, sold to MSD after delisting from LSE in 2020</p> <p><strong>July</strong> Adaptimmune Therapeutics sells four cell therapy assets to US WorldMeds and cuts UK workforce by 62%</p> <p><strong>June</strong> GSK shuts Ulverston factory (100 jobs) and makes cuts at Barnard Castle in October (200 jobs)</p> <p><strong>January</strong> AstraZeneca scraps £450m investment in Speke, Liverpool</p> <p><strong>January</strong> Rentschler Biopharma closes Stevenage site (30 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2024</strong> Sanofi reduced its Kymab labs in Cambridge (50 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2023</strong> Recipharm closes Queenborough site on Isle of Sheppey (150 jobs)</p> <p><strong>2022</strong> Novartis sells Grimsby site (200+ jobs)</p>",

He had voted for Starmer in the 2020 contest was now “quite unfavourable” about Keir Starmer and summed it up by saying: ‘<em>The leadership needs to be made aware how unhappy the members are with the direction of government and how it’s functioning.

Agnes was the youngest.</p> <p>Agnes lived in Nanyuki for all of her 21 years, and if she ever travelled it was only to visit her sister Cecilia, who lived several hours away.</p> <p>She started her primary education at a school in Nanyuki, DEB primary, and later joined Gakawa secondary school. She enjoyed lessons and her favourite subject was literature. She also loved music; she would often be caught singing or dancing.</p> <p>She enjoyed busying herself in the kitchen and spending her spare time with her extended family. As a sister, daughter and aunt, Agnes was dependable and kind, her family said, and she was also funny.</p> <p>“She was always joking, smiling,” said her niece Esther Njoki. “We were always laughing because of her jokes.”</p> <p>Growing up, Agnes would look after her younger nieces, spending time braiding their hair. Later, she turned her hobby into her career; she began training to be hairdresser in 2010. She finished her course in August 2011. Just a few months later, before she had had a chance to properly start out in her new career, she was dead.</p> <p>While she completed her studies, Agnes was also heavily pregnant. Her daughter Stacey was born on 20 October that year. “Agnes’s feelings about becoming a mum was [that it was] the best feeling ever,” Esther Njoki said.</p> <p>She loved her baby daughter but struggled to provide for her, and like many young women in Nanyuki, Agnes would make extra money from selling sex. Batuk, the British army training base nearby, provided a steady flow of custom.</p> <p>Soldiers would come into Nanyuki to drink and socialise and many would pay for sex with local women, often several in one night, paying them as little as the equivalent of £1 a time.</p> <p>Agnes would go to bars in the town to meet her friends, and dance. The night she disappeared, 31 March 2012, started like many others. She went to the Lion’s Court hotel, a favourite haunt of British soldiers, to meet her friends Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.</p> <p>They remembered her joining them at about 11pm and the three women dancing together. Agnes was drinking a beer that she told her friends had been bought for her by a British soldier.</p> <p>Instead of returning home to her sister, her daughter and her niece as she had every other night, Agnes disappeared. The next morning, her friends and family had not heard from her. They went to the hotel where she had last been seen, and spent weeks searching for Agnes, until her body was discovered two months later.</p> <p>Agnes’s death has had a lasting effect on her family. Stacey was five months old when she lost her mother and will not remember her but has been deeply affected after learning how she died.</p> <p>“We have been having moments where she sees something about her mum and she breaks down,” Njoki said, “and that’s because of trauma.”</p> <p>Njoki and her mother, Rose, have carried the heavy burden of Agnes’s death for 13 years. “You just keep on thinking about Agnes, about the case, and you just feel bad,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s really traumatising, for sure, and saddening, and our hearts [are broken].”</p>",

    "description": "<ul><li><p>World champion says ‘only matter of time’ to reach 9.6sec</p></li><li><p>Seville dismisses effect of Noah Lyles’ mind games</p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>On Sunday night, Oblique Seville became the first Jamaican to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/14/oblique-seville-men-100m-final-world-athletics-championships\">win the men’s 100m world title</a> since Usain Bolt. But it turns out the 24-year-old’s mind is just as quick as his blistering leg speed.</p> <p>In an interview to celebrate his victory, Seville was asked if he were to design a sprinter what would he look like. The questioner expected a long answer. Perhaps Justin Gatlin’s start, Michael Johnson’s mentality, and Bolt’s leg speed.</p> <p>But one word came back from Seville’s mouth almost instantaneously. “Usain.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/gout-gout-world-athletics-championships-200m-heat-preview\">Time comes for Gout Gout to prove himself against sprinting’s best emerging talent | Jack Snape </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s never been anyone like him, has there?” he’s asked. “No,” Seville said. “But I would take his last part of his race and my start. Then you would have the perfect sprinter.”</p> <p>However, there is one issue that Seville disagrees with his hero about. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/i-get-out-of-breath-walking-up-the-stairs-these-days-usain-bolt-admits\">Bolt insisted the current generation did not have the talent</a> to run the 100m in the 9.6sec, like he, Yohan Blake and Tyson Gay once did. Seville, who ran a personal best of 9.77sec to win gold in Tokyo, disagreed.</p> <p>“In my opinion, it’s just only a matter of time before someone is going to run 9.6,” he said. “I don’t think we are far off in this generation. It just takes us time. Because you have to understand, it was the same back then.</p> <p>“No one was running 9.6 until Usain Bolt put his foot in Beijing. So it’s for us now, as a new generation, for us to just meet that step. To prove that we can actually do the same thing that Usain did.”</p> <p>The difference between Seville and Bolt could barely be more pronounced. Both hail from Jamaica but Bolt was 6ft 5in and weighed about 14st, and Seville is 5ft 6in and just 11st 6lb. Seville loves going to church and said he prepared for the 100m final by reading the Bible “which gave me a lot of peace of mind”. Bolt, it is fair to say, had a rather different approach.</p> <p>However, the men share the same coach: Glen Mills. And it was Mills who always believed that Seville could emulate Bolt by becoming the fastest man on the planet.</p> <p>“I realised that I was a fast kid when I was six,” said Seville. “I was running against kids that were bigger than me and I was very competitive. So I showed it at a very early age.</p> <p>“When I just started out with my coach, he said it’s going to take me a few years to get to the podium. And whatever he says, that is what’s going to happen. His words manifested upon me and here I am right now, a gold medallist.</p> <p>“He can be tough at times and he’s a good guy because he’s a very intelligent guy. And I learn a lot from him in and out of sport. He guides me mentally and shows me my career, physically.”</p> <p>Since Bolt left the sport in 2017, the crown of the world champion has slipped, light-fingered, through the hands of Gatlin, Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Noah Lyles. Could Seville, who was one of the favourites for gold in Paris, be the one that holds on to the crown? He hopes so. But he knows it will be difficult.</p> <p>“I have the mentality. But you know that injuries are a part of the sport,” said Seville. “And because of my height and size I cannot make any mistakes. I have to ensure that everything that I do is on point.”</p> <p>That mentality was also strong when the American Lyles tried to play mind games on the Jamaicans before the final. “It doesn’t have any effect on me,” said Seville. “Because over the years I realised that Noah is going to be Noah. And he’s going to talk.</p> <p>“I respect that. It’s good for the sport. It might have worked on other athletes but not me. I came to the world championship for one purpose. To win the gold.” And he did that, all right.</p>  ",

A boundary-laden cameo from Joe Clarke (29) and an unbeaten 30 from Brett Hutton apart, the visiting batsmen struggled to assert their authority.</p> <p>Fisher enjoyed his first five-wicket haul for Surrey since he moved from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> last winter. “We did what we usually do, hunt like a pack,” he said after play. “I felt like I’ve put in decent areas all season, sometimes I’m lacking that little bit of nip but I had it today.” And on watching his bowling partner: “I’m purring at mid-on watching Gus.” Ben Foakes finished with five catches.</p> <p>As the shadows spread over the ground like a rash, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley did what they do, playing a straight and steady bat. Then from nowhere, Dillon Pennington made one spit off the pitch and Sibley got a lick as it passed by. The batter threw his head back in frustration as he had to trudge back to the pavilion, out for 14 with just nine balls left.</p> <p>The high winds which delayed play around all the grounds (except the Riverside, which was affected purely by rain) did so because of the risks to ground staff and spectators in handling flat covers, including the covers lifting staff off the ground, or blowing loose and hitting the crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c922b08f084793c7c16363\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scores on the doors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>Division One</strong></h2> <p><strong>Riverside:</strong> Durham v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire\">Worcestershire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Taunton:</strong> Somerset v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire\">Hampshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>The Oval:</strong> Surrey 43-1 v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nottinghamshire\">Nottinghamshire</a> 231</p> <p><strong>Hove:</strong> Sussex v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\">Yorkshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Edgbaston:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc\">Warwickshire</a> v Essex <em> </em></p> <h2><strong>Division Two</strong></h2> <p><strong>The County Ground:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/derbyshire\">Derbyshire</a> v Glamorgan <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Bristol:</strong> Gloucestershire v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonshire\">Northamptonshire</a> <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Old Trafford:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire\">Lancashire</a> v Middlesex <em> </em></p> <p><strong>Grace Road:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestershire\">Leicestershire</a> v Kent </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c7defb8f086519d3272613\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:51:59.669Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning</strong> from The Oval where the Hobbs gates are open, the sky is periwinkle, and Surrey are on top in this crucial Championship arm wrestle.

    "content": "<p>First Tokyo witnessed the spectacular. Then came a divine act of Faith.</p> <p>In the women’s 400m, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran one of the fastest times in history, easing down, to raise the question of whether one of the oldest – and most controversial – track and field records might fall later this week.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards another standout female of her generation, Faith Kipyegon, underlined her status by speeding to a historic fourth 1500m title with such grace and distance that it took the breath away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both women have long stood tall in athletics’ pantheon. What they do in the coming days could reinforce their case to be considered as the greatest female athlete of all time.</p> <p>McLaughlin-Levrone, of course, already holds numerous gold medals and world records in the 400m hurdles. But now, suddenly, she has the 400m gold and possibly even the world record of 47.60 sec set by Marita Koch in 1985 in her sights too.</p> <p>The American showed that by running 48.29 sec in Tuesday’s semi-final – smashing her personal best by nearly half a second – and then promising to run faster in Thursday’s final.</p> <p>“This race definitely gives me confidence for the final,” she said. “I didn’t expect to run this fast today. And I still have more to show.”</p> <p>That sounds ominous for Koch, who has long been alleged to be part of East Germany’s state-sponsored doping programme, in books and newspaper articles. When asked about it by the BBC in 2014, she replied: “I don’t have to prove anything to myself. I have a clear conscience. I can only repeat myself … I never tested positive, I never did anything which I should not have done at that time.”</p> <p>Koch did acknowledge the fact that the record would ultimately be overtaken, though, saying that “at some point, that time will come”. It could even be on Thursday .</p> <p>However, McLaughlin-Levrone will not have things completely her own way given that the Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and the former world champion Salwa Eid Naser are running well.</p> <p>They will be joined in the final by Britain’s Amber Anning, who ran 49.38sec to automatically qualify. “I’m in such great shape,” she insisted.</p> <p>Paulino is even more confident, promising: “God and I will make history here.”</p> <p>The 31-year-old Kipyegon has already done that. On Tuesday she matched Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four world 1500m titles.</p> <p>With 300m to go Kipyegon, who broke her own world record earlier this year, looked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/australias-jess-hull-takes-1500m-bronze-after-brave-race-against-kenya-legend-faith-kipyegon\">under threat from the Australian Jessica Hull</a>. But then she applied the afterburners and the race was put to bed long before she crossed the line in 3min 52.15sec.</p>    <p>Hull, who had promised she would give it her all and try to win gold faded badly but clung on for bronze. Another Kenyan, Dorcus Ewoi, took silver. Now Kipyegon has a moouthwatering 5,000m clash of the titans to look forward to against the 10,000m world champion, Beatrice Chebet.</p> <p>“Being able to defend my title and to win a fourth gold feels really special,” said Kipyegon, who held four fingers up as she crossed the line. “This sport drives me. I need to push myself in order to be the best.</p> <p>It was another bad night for Britain with Matt Hudson-Smith, the Olympic and world silver medallist, going out of the men’s 400m at the semi-final stage, along with Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon. Reardon pointed to a long break outside the stadium as a factor in finishing last. </p> <p>“After the first 50m I just felt the tightening of my hamstring and pain,” he said. “You warm up to get yourself ready, and when you’re delayed for that long outside in the stadium, in the elements cooling down every second. It’s not really helpful.</p> <p>To make matters worse, World Athletics also reprimanded the British team after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with ‘100% Jesus’ on it during the semi-final of the 100m. The marketing of religious and political slogans is banned during competition by the governing body’s rules.</p> <p>“We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences,” read a World Athletics statement.</p> <p>It also emerged that a group of leading athletes will consider legal action if they are not paid by the end of the September for racing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/21/michael-johnson-grand-slam-track-misses-vital-village-fete-feel-athletics\">Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track</a>. Multiple athletes are still waiting on prize money after competing in the first three rounds, before the cancellation of the planned final event in Los Angeles. Johnson did not respond when approached for comment.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there was gold for New Zealand’s Hamish Kerr in the men’s high jump and for the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/usas-cordell-tinch-goes-from-toilet-paper-factory-to-110m-hurdles-world-champion\">Cordell Tinch in the 110m hurdles</a>, while there was better news for Britain in the men’s 800m as Ben Pattison and Max Burgin looked comfortable in qualifying for Thursday’s semi-finals.<br><br>Burgin, who won his heat in 1:44.73, looked comfortable until just after he gave an interview to the BBC and then threw up – something he often does after races. “Standard fare for me,” he said later, smiling.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jacob Bethell is ready for England to “chuck me in the deep end” as he prepares to lead the side for the first time against Ireland on Wednesday, making him the country’s youngest men’s captain.</p> \n<p>With Harry Brook rested for this quickfire three-match Twenty20 series in Malahide, just north of Dublin, the 21-year-old steps in to continue his brisk rise in international cricket. Bethell made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/11/travis-head-helps-blast-australia-to-t20-liftoff-against-inexperienced-england\">his England debut last September</a> and impressed in his first Test series against New Zealand at the end of the year. Yet to seal a regular place in the red-ball XI, he has become an automatic pick in Brendon McCullum’s white-ball teams.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">Ireland’s near-empty cricket summer in stark contrast to England’s slate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Baz gave me a ring and said I was going to be skipper,” said Bethell. “Not a whole lot has been said of why I’ve been chosen for the role. I don’t know the exact thinking of those who are in charge. I guess it’s maybe just a bit of trust, and showing a bit of faith. It will be nice to see how I go under pressure, and I’m sure that the guys that have made the decision would like to see that as well.</p> \n<p>“I like when things come at a fast pace, it tends to get me up and about. So I like those situations, doesn’t mean that they always work. But hopefully this one does.”</p> \n<p>Even with plenty of experienced names in the squad to face Ireland, Bethell’s ascension is in line with the management’s wilder impulses when it comes to selection. He will have to fall back on his previous experience of leading England Under-19s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e30692bd-17ee-4abf-bc7f-406957216e62\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ireland&nbsp;</b>Paul Stirling (capt), Ross Adair, Lorcan Tucker (wkt), Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Ben Calitz, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Barry McCarthy, Matthew Humphreys, Craig Young</p>\n    <p><b>England&nbsp;</b>Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wkt), Jordan Cox, Jacob Bethell (capt), Sam Curran, Tom Banton, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Adil Rashid, Luke Wood, Sonny Baker</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“A very young one,” replied a smiling Bethell when asked what type of captain he is. “The main thing I’ve looked up to in captains I’ve had previously is how they manage people. Not every tactical decision you make is going to work, but it’s managing the boys well so they feel you’re backing them. I’ve got no preconceived ideas of how I’m going to be.”</p> \n<p>Bethell has found form with the bat since he was announced as captain last month, having hit his first professional century in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">third ODI against South Africa</a> less than a fortnight ago. “I didn’t play for a while and maybe lost a little bit of rhythm, but felt that rhythm come back about midway through the Hundred so it’s great to be back feeling good.” He did not get dragged into any detailed Ashes talk: “My head’s firmly screwed on to this series.”</p> \n<p>Harry Tector and Paul Stirling “are the two main threats with the bat” for Ireland, said Bethell. The hosts enter underprepared having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/16/ireland-cricket-england-dublin-malahide-t20-series\">not played since June</a> – a completely different story to England – and will be without the whippy left-arm pace of Josh Little, on the mend from a rib injury. Yet the only completed T20 meeting between these two sides brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/ireland-stun-england-at-t20-world-cup-to-throw-super-12s-wide-open\">an Irish victory in Melbourne</a> at the World Cup three years ago, a reminder that it may not be all smooth for Bethell over the coming days.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the wake of the Trump administration’s announcement that it will overturn the rule which underpins virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee has launched an investigation into a suspected lobbying push that led to the move.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Senate environment and public works committee sent letters to two dozen corporations, including oil giants, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations. The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/31/trump-epa-endangerment-finding\">said in July</a> that it will unmake.</p> <p>The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/oil-donations-republicans-trump-anti-environment-bill\">Republicans who backed Trump’s anti-environment bill have accepted over $105m from big oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”</p> <p>Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.</p> <p>“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.</p> <p>It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.</p> <p>Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.</p> <p>The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched, and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.</p> <p>Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/climate/epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-proposal.html\">reported</a> that groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.</p> <p>When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.</p> <p>“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.</p> <p>Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.</p> <p>“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”</p> <p>Two environmental non-profits <a href=\"https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/0kdlw6oq5v8hsvj152eqx01b0qn74uuq.pdf\">have sued the Trump administration</a> for “secretly” convening a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/climate-science-trump-administration\">climate contrarians</a> to bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.</p> <p>The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/trump-air-climate-pollution-regulation-100-days\">war on the environment</a> by the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.</p> <p>“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.</p>",

government faces new questions about its response to last week’s Russian drones incursion</strong>, amid media reports that a house in the village of Wyryki damaged that night may have been hit not by a Russian drone, but by a missile launched from a Polish fighter jet sent to intercept it.</p> \n  <p>The report, first published by <a href=\"https://www.rp.pl/wojsko/art43015001-polska-rakieta-uderzyla-w-dom-na-lubelszczyznie\">Rzeczpospolita</a> daily and later confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetwiadomosci/to-rakieta-z-polskiego-f-16-zniszczyla-dom-w-wyrykach-prezydent-reaguje/kfjvs6b,79cfc278\">Onet</a>, included <strong>a suggestion that the missile’s targeting system malfunctioned on launch, but its in-built safety system prevented it from arming and exploding.</strong></p> \n  <p>Today’s media claims prompted <strong>the National Security Bureau, reporting to the opposition-aligned president Karol Nawrocki, to urge the government to “immediately clarify” what happened.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The government’s response focused on stressing Russia’s overall responsibility for the attack,</strong> which triggered the military reaction, without focusing on the details or confirming the reporting.</p> \n  <p>Poland’s <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> did not take questions from reporters when he appeared at a media briefing announcing plans on submarine procurement earlier today, but he responded to media reports on X, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the damage to the house in Wyryki falls on the authors of the drone provocation, that is, Russia.</strong> The appropriate services will inform the public, the government, and the president about all the circumstances of the incident after the proceedings are completed.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em><strong>“Hands off Polish soldiers.”</strong></em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>My definition of a Russian sockpuppet is someone who tries to remove responsibility from Russia</strong> for the consequences of the drone provocation against Poland.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Poland’s deputy foreign minister <strong>Marcin Bosacki</strong>, who represented Poland at the UN security council meeting on the incident last week, said:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“<strong>All responsibility for the losses resulting from the Russian provocation of sending 19 military drones into Poland falls on Russia </strong>– whether the damage was caused by the drones or by the missiles intercepting them, used IN DEFENCE by Polish and allied armed forces.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The <strong>Polish ministry of defence issued only a brief statement saying that “the relevant state authorities are conducting a full investigation</strong> into the events following Russia’s aggression.”</p> \n  <p>“<strong>However, it is already clear today that Russia is responsible for the provocation and its consequences,</strong>” it said.</p> \n  <p>It later added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Regardless of the final conclusions of the state authorities, <strong>the destroyed house in the town of Wyryki will be rebuilt at the state’s expense.</strong>”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In its statement, <strong>the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/DowOperSZ/status/1967964049133428873\">sidestepped</a> the question about what happened, insisting instead that it provided the relevant authorities with “all available information, without any omissions.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c987448f080f2d1dcf1d06\"

programme “is unlikely to be achieved” with <strong>a “disconnect” between pledges made in Brussels and what happens on the ground.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Some 32 of the world’s 44 least developed countries (LDC) are in Africa</strong>, with Haiti, the only one categorised as such in the Caribbean are with eight countries in Asia including Cambodia and two in the Pacific classed as LDCs.</p> \n  <p>An in depth investigation by the court of auditors published today looked at <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Cambodia</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It found <strong>simple issues had arisen inhibiting its efficacy including training of public servants rather than business people.</strong><br><br>In Malawi, <strong>the EU found that a programme it had backed for farmers and small businesses was not backed by local banks involved.</strong> Instead they “only gave loans to big clients they had already worked with”.</p> \n  <p>Between 2017 and 2022 the EU and its member states allocated €17.2bn through the Aid for Trade programme to the world’s least developed countries, “a fraction of the overall €105.8bn sent to other developing countries”, the court of auditors said. </p> \n  <p>It also pointed out that the share received by the least developed countries declined from 18% of the Aid for Trade programme, to just 12% in 2022.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c97e8f8f080f2d1dcf1c91\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kiran-stacey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

defence.</strong></p> \n  <p>“We are not ready for either a Russian attack or an attack by another nation,” he added. “I’ve been saying this for a long time. <strong>I think it’s our job to put this

significantly increase defence spending over the next decade, even if the policy is extremely unpopular among Italians.</p> \n  <p><strong>In 2024, Italy’s defence spending was just 1.5% of output – at the lower end of the 32 Nato members.</strong> The country has committed to increasing this to 5% by 2035.

to do so.</strong></p> \n  <p>“<strong>If you’ve got drones that are putting Polish lives at risk, then Nato will take the action to take them out,</strong>” Healey said, adding the Typhoons were part of a broader mission “to defend Nato airspace”.</p> \n  <p><strong>Over the weekend, Romania became the second Nato ally in eastern Europe to detect a Russian drone crossing into its airspace in a week</strong> – and Healey said the Typhoons mission would extend operations to the country if deemed necessary.</p> \n  <p>He said: “They are deployed as part of the Nato Eastern Sentry air policing. <strong>What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato.</strong> That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”</p> \n  <p>There was <strong>no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate.</strong> </p> \n  <p>Healey said: “<strong>There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point.</strong> It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c92a828f084793c7c163a0\"

substance, the more reforms, and this is a point I made some times, the more we push [for] reforms, the more private capital will step up and the less public money we will need.”</p> \n  <p>“Of course, <strong>this path will break longstanding taboos, but the rest of the world has already broken theirs.</strong> For Europe’s survival, <strong>we must do what has not been done before</strong>, and refuse to be held back by self imposed limits,” he says.</p> \n  <p>He stresses the EU needs to “move beyond broad strategies and back-loaded timelines,” and need “concrete dates and deliverables.”</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“European citizens are <strong>asking that their leaders raise their eyes from their daily concerns</strong> towards their common European destiny

change elsewhere,' Draghi says as he urges EU to move faster on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, <strong>Mario Draghi – of the Draghi report – is speaking now</strong> and he is not exactly as positive as von der Leyen.</p> \n  <p>He talks about <strong>the need for the EU to move faster, be more agile, and match the pace of change elsewhere.</strong></p> \n  <p>He says that having his plan means that “Europe’s citizens and companies value the diagnosis, the clear priorities and the action plans, but they also express growing frustration” with the pace of change.</p> \n  <p><strong>“</strong>They are disappointed by how slowly the EU moves. <strong>They see us failing to match the speed of change elsewhere.</strong> They are ready to act, but fear governments have not grasped the gravity of the moment,<strong>”</strong> he says.</p> \n  <p>He adds that <strong>“too often, excuses are made for our slowness,”</strong> with some portraying it as the EU’s strength or respect for the rule of law.</p> \n  <p>“I think <strong>that’s complacency.</strong> Competitors in US and China are far less constrained even when acting within the law. <strong>To carry on as usual is to resign ourselves to falling behind,</strong>” he warns.</p> \n  <p>“<strong>A different path demands new speed, scale and intensity.</strong> It means acting together, not fragmenting our efforts. It means focusing resources where impact is greatest. It means delivering results within months, not years,” he argues.</p> \n  <p>On AI, he also strikes a more cautions tone, saying that it “depends on the orchestration of at least four other technologies” in cloud, supercomputing, cybersecurity and fibre satellites.</p> \n  <p>He says that Europe is falling behind the US and China on large foundation models, and sees lower AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>He stresses that “more ambition is needed” to “remove barriers to scaling up new technologies,” as he calls for more support from member states to move faster.</p> \n  <p>Draghi also takes about the AI Act being “another source of uncertainty,” suggesting that the next stage of codes of practice on high risk AI systems should be “paused until we better understand the drawbacks” as he called for “ex post” assessment to drive enforcement.</p> \n  <p>On industrial policies needed to respond to the rise of economic nationalism and protectionism, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“States are using every tool at their disposal to advance their interests. <strong>So far, Europe’s response has fallen into two traps, uncoordinated national efforts or blind faith that market force will build new structures.</strong> The first can never deliver scale. The second is impossible when others distort markets and tilt the level playing field.”</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><em>Ouch, ouch, ouch.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c919958f0807088ffe78cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:10:05.436Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU's von der Leyen praises bloc's progress on competitiveness</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As I mentioned earlier, <strong>the EU’s von der Leyen is speaking now in Brussels on “one year after the Draghi report.”</strong></p> \n  <p>Painting a rather rosy picture, she argues that <strong>Europe “is not only a challenger, but a leader in many fields that will define that race” on innovation,</strong> including computing power and AI adoption.</p> \n  <p>She insists that <strong>Europe “is not playing catch up”</strong> like it was during the rise of the Internet, but is “among the frontrunners.”</p> \n  <p>But on a slightly more critical tone, she says that <strong>Europe “needs to capitalise on our strengths”</strong> as she pointed out that the bloc’s “single market is far from being completed” and this needs to change to help companies grow.</p> \n  <p><strong>“It should not be easier to find a fortune across an ocean than across a European border, and we have started to address these barriers,”</strong> she says, stressing plans to progress reforms by 2028.</p> \n  <p>She also <strong>talks about the progress on cleaner energy</strong>, even as she admits that “our energy prices remain still far too high, too volatile, too disparate across Europe” with more to be done on interconnectors and grids across the continent.</p> \n  <p><strong>Von der Leyen also talks about the need to reduce Europe’s dependencies,</strong> particularly on China. “With the right policies, we can shore up our security,” she says.</p> \n  <p><em>I’ll keep monitoring her speech for key lines.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c918138f0807088ffe78c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-16T08:02:12.817Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 3,500 drones launched at Ukraine this month, Zelenskyy says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> <strong>Zelenskyy said that Russia has launched more than 3,500 drones and nearly 190 missiles against Ukraine so far this month.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>“There have also been provocations against our partners,”</strong> he said on X, refering to recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania.</p> \n  <p>“This is <strong>precisely the kind of aerial terror against which Ukraine is calling for joint defence</strong> – so that no one has to scramble combat aircraft in haste and feel Russia’s pressure on their borders.”</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>“Now is <strong>the time to implement the joint protection of our European skies</strong> with a multi-layered air defense system. </em></p> \n   <p><em>All the technologies for this are already in place.

    "description": "<p>Videos of frontman Ken Casey confronting rightwing provocateurs at the band’s gigs have gone viral, attracting new fans and new safety worries. He wants to lower the temperature – and see other bands speaking out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Backstage at the Rock la Cauze festival in Victoriaville, Canada, where Boston punk-rock institution Dropkick Murphys are headlining, founding bassist/singer Ken Casey is experiencing an uncharacteristic moment of anxiety.</p> <p>“We have concerns about going back over the border tonight,” he says, gravely – not for the illicit reasons touring musicians usually fear border crossings, but because Casey’s regular on stage rants against Donald Trump have gone viral. “We’re not worried about being arrested,” he adds. “But we have a show in New York tomorrow. Are we gonna get harassed or held up? We used to come over that border and they’d be, ‘Dropkicks! Come right through!’ But what’s it going to be like now?”</p> <p>By “now”, Casey means during the second Trump presidency, which has brought the political element always present within Dropkick Murphys’ bolshie, Pogues and Clash-influenced bruisers to the fore. The group’s resistance has found its sharpest expression at their shows, where their anthem <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=first+class+loser+dropkick+murphys&amp;oq=first+clas&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgoIARAuGLEDGIAEMgoIAhAAGLEDGIAEMgYIAxBFGDkyCggEEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBggHEEUYPdIBCDIxMTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:8c8bcc3d,vid:AjvNrF-v8AY,st:0\">First Class Loser</a> is accompanied by videos depicting Trump and former chum Jeffrey Epstein, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4ggwyWEMI\">Casey’s skirmishes with a vocal minority of Maga Dropkicks fans</a> in the mosh pit have lit up social media. He admits these fans often provoke the worst in him. “How do you know if someone’s in a cult? They hold up a hat all fuckin’ night,” he rages in one clip.</p> <p>“People tell me, ‘You didn’t use-ta soapbox like this’,” he says on our video call, gathering steam. “Well, we didn’t use-ta be in the midst of an authoritarian takeover!”</p> <p>Dropkick Murphys are still commanding big blue-collar crowds as they approach their 30th anniversary in 2026. Over the years they’ve scored numerous US Top 10 albums, Bruce Springsteen collaborations and a platinum-seller in the form of civic anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw\">I’m Shipping Up to Boston</a>, boosted by its appearance in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed. But their value system, Casey says, hasn’t changed since the now seven-strong band formed with the aim “to be a voice for working people”. Class and the labour movement are key to the 56-year-old’s identity. “My father died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandfather, a labour organiser who instilled in me the value of a union. In the Boston suburb where I was raised, everyone owed their lives to a union job. It put a roof over our head.”</p>    <p>The Boston of Casey’s youth was heavily Irish-American. “The English love to call us ‘plastic paddies’, but I’ve never thought of myself as Irish – I’m <em>Boston</em> Irish, the people that fought against the most Wasp-y, keep-the-Irish-down place that ever existed,” he says, referring to how Irish refugees fleeing the great famine of 19th-century were targeted by anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant groups and scorned by the English Protestant Puritans who had settled America. “To go from those trenches to positions of power in city hall, on the railroad and in the utility companies led to my generation being able to have the middle-class life.”</p> <p>He pauses for a second, but he’s not finished: Casey would make a great labour organiser himself. “When that’s your story, you need to be willing to aid the culture that’s coming next. One immigrant culture can’t close the door behind them, especially not in America. We’re all immigrants here.”</p> <p>A tearaway in his youth, Casey quit drink and drugs before he reached 21, “because otherwise I’d be in prison,” he says. “I had a big problem as a teen.” He ploughed his energies into the hardcore punk scene surrounding Boston venue the Rathskeller, AKA the Rat. “Punk-rock was the soundtrack to my friggin’ mayhem. I was a rebellious kid, I liked the underdog vibe.” In 1996, now booking shows at the Rat, a co-worker bet him $30 he “didn’t have the balls to start a band on three weeks’ notice”. Never one to back down from a wager, Casey formed Dropkick Murphys.</p> <p>His identity was stamped all over the group. Before they even used Celtic instrumentation – the Dropkicks are the rare punk band to field a bagpiper – he says the embryonic Dropkicks “sounded like [1960s Irish folk group] the Clancy Brothers meets the Ramones – the delivery, the melodies, the lyrical content. It just naturally poured out of me.”</p> <p>Their beginnings were hardscrabble: pressing their own singles, booking their own shows and touring in an old Boston transit bus, for reasons of poverty and pride. “We peeled the roof off under a low bypass,” he grins. “We toured for two more years with that roof open like a convertible. When it rained, I held an umbrella over the driver.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d8SzG4FPyM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9d8SzG4FPyM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Dropkick Murphys: Rose Tattoo – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>By the 21st century, they had become staples of the US punk-rock circuit, their annual St Patrick’s Day shows among Boston’s hottest tickets, performing and recording with their heroes. “We play Billy Bragg’s There Is Power in a Union over the PA every night before we go on stage,” Casey says. “He opened our St Patrick’s show last year with it and then played Worker’s Song with us. Afterwards, he said, ‘I felt like I was in the fuckin’ Clash for three minutes!’” Springsteen, another member of the Dropkicks’ extended family, recorded their Rose Tattoo for a charity single after the Boston Marathon bombing, and sang Peg O’ My Heart with Dropkicks in Boston, “back when my grandmother Peg was still alive”, says Casey. “He came on with her for the encore – we had to pry her off Bruce’s arm to get her off the stage. I’m almost shocked a guy of that level was so down-to-earth. But he’s always had an affinity with punk. Bruce still walks the talk.”</p> <p>“Walking the talk” matters to the Dropkicks; their merch is made in the US by union-approved manufacturers, while their <a href=\"https://www.claddaghfund.org/\">Claddagh Fund</a> supports non-profit organisations across Boston. “We were pretty beloved in our city, whether people liked our music or not, because we gave a lot back to the community,” Casey says. Not any more, however. “Now a lot of people in my circles say ‘Fuck Dropkick Murphys’,” he adds, lantern jaw clenching. “Although never to my face. They despise me and the band.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s clear that, for Casey, the political is personal. His sense of betrayal regarding “the many rank-and-file union members who are now Trump voters” is palpable. “They don’t think Trump’s coming for the unions, but he’s coming for the unions, trust me. I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. It’s about total control for the rich. It’s class war.”</p> <p>What is the magic spell Trump has managed to cast over a demographic who were until recently, Casey says, “in lockstep with Dropkicks’ beliefs”? “Trump offered them a chance to say out loud things people used to have to whisper to their friends,” Casey spits. “Racism, cruelty, jokes about disabilities. A lot of white people in America believed whites will not be in control any more, especially after Obama. This is their last, desperate grasp to hold control.”</p> <p>The Dropkicks have met this grim moment with records that have transformed their previously cartoonish riot music into something more sober, biting and heartfelt. Two acoustic albums – 2022’s This Machine Still Kills Fascists and 2023’s Okemah Rising – set unrecorded Woody Guthrie polemics to their music. “Woody’s grandson Cole told his mom Nora, ‘Grandpa would’ve liked these guys’,” Casey beams proudly. “It made us better musicians, doing it all acoustic. But that left us with a hunger to go electric and be a punk-rock band again.” Which brings us to this year’s <a href=\"https://www.kerrang.com/album-review-dropkick-murphys-for-the-people\">For the People</a>, which opens with Who’ll Stand With Us? A key lyric: “The working people fuel the engine / While you yank the chain.”</p>    <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrxVX3iNvhY\">viral clip from a recent show</a>, Casey bets a fan in a Maga shirt $100 that it wasn’t manufactured in the US; it was, inevitably, manufactured in Nicaragua, and Casey swapped the offending garment for a union-made Dropkicks T-shirt.</p> <p>“If America is ever going to go back to some semblance of normal, we have to bring the temperature down, we need to be able to talk to each other,” Casey says, referencing that night. “I talked to that guy afterwards, and he said, ‘I don’t let politics get in the way of family, and I consider you family’. I could have jumped down his throat, but he seemed open to reason.” He pauses. “That’s rare for Maga, though. Other days, I’m like, ‘Fuck this, I don’t even want to know these people, if this is how they think and behave’. Do I want to have a dialogue with these people? No. I’m just hoping the fever will break. I don’t need them to have a ‘come to Jesus’ moment on the difference between right and wrong – I just need them not to support what’s happening.”</p> <p>Does he fear blowback for his outspokenness, like that suffered by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/-late-show-stephen-colbert-wins-emmy-cbs-cancellation-rcna231276\">Stephen Colbert</a> – or worse?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/21/deftones-singer-chino-moreno-ive-got-hundreds-of-drawings-of-myself-in-my-house\">Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unlike Stephen, we have no parent company, so we can say what we want,” he says. “Regarding our safety … whatever,” he snarls, disdainfully. “I’ll never have a security guard or anything like that. But you gotta keep your head on a swivel a little bit. Back in the day, we always had a Nazi element gunning for us, but you could see them coming. Now you don’t know who’s who. I’m not sure what’s keeping other people quiet, though, especially in punk-rock. Where’d everyone go? They had the balls to speak out against Bush back in the day. But Bush didn’t have an army of trolls that come after you. Speaking out against Bush wasn’t going to cost you half your fanbase, potentially.”</p> <p>In his darker moments, Casey reckons “within a year, this country’s gonna fall on its face, and people are gonna feel the pain: recession, inflation, unemployment. There’s nobody coming to save us.” He says he feels “no excitement or happiness” in the group’s anti-Trump screeds winning them newfound fame. “But maybe there’s a slight sense of validation,” he adds. “I talk to the fans every night. One night, an immigrant told me, ‘I moved here, and my partner is American, we have children, and I live in fear of being deported. My own friends have turned on me, they say I’m taking American jobs.’ He was actually in tears at the end. But he said, ‘I feel like someone is speaking on my behalf’. From the earliest days of this band, we wanted to be involved in something that mattered. So we are. I wish it was a different subject and not quite so important, but …”</p> <p>He sighs. Maybe the border tonight will be a shitshow, but it won’t change how the Dropkicks operate in this darkest of moments. “We’re sticking our neck out and getting a lot of negative attention,” he adds. “But if we don’t do it now, it might be too late.”</p> <p>• For the People is out now on Dummy Luck Music/PIAS. <a href=\"https://dropkickmurphys.com/tour/\">Dropkick Murphys’ European tour</a> begins 15 October at Alcatraz, Milan</p>",

    "description": "<p>‘Sobering and concerning’ that Axel Rudakubana had searched X for Australia knife attack, inquiry told</p>",
    "content": "<p>A lawyer said it was “sobering and concerning” that the Southport attacker probably viewed footage on social media of a stabbing in Australia by a teenage boy just 40 minutes before carrying out his own crimes.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.southport.public-inquiry.uk/\">inquiry is being held</a> into the circumstances and events leading up to the attack by Axel Rudakubana, then 17, on 29 July 2024 in which he murdered three young girls and attempted to murder eight children and two adults.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the inquiry, outlined what would be explored and the questions that would be asked during the course of the inquiry, being held at Liverpool town hall.</p> <p>Moss said a notable feature of the “extremely cowardly” attack was that it was “specifically targeting women and girls”.</p> <p>He said the inquiry would establish a timeline of Rudakubana’s history and “interactions with various state systems including criminal justice, education, social care and healthcare”.</p> <p>Questions will also be asked of Rudakubana’s parents and of the social media companies Meta and X.</p> <p>Moss referred to Rudakubana as AR throughout his submission, and described him as a “prolific internet user”.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that the teenager had deleted his browsing history on his laptop before carrying out his crimes. But evidence showed he used another tablet to search on X for a knife attack by a teenage boy on a bishop in Australia.</p>    <p>The search led him to posts on X likely to have shown the actual act of stabbing, Moss said.</p> <p>“The inquiry has made a statement request of X about the fact that the act of a stabbing would have been viewable on its platform apparently to a 17-year-old boy,” he said.</p> <p>“It might, perhaps, be thought to be both sobering and concerning, in terms of online harms, that almost the last thing AR did before committing these dreadful crimes was to search for, and possibly view, material on Twitter in relation to a stabbing carried out by another boy aged under 18.”</p> <p>Moss said Meta, which owns Instagram, and X had been asked for “information about AR’s use of their platforms and we await their substantive responses”.</p> <p>Rudakubana travelled by taxi from his home in Banks to a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance class for children in Southport, where he committed his crimes. The inquiry was shown the pink-coloured advert for the class, which was “bound to appeal more to girls than boys”, Moss said.</p> <p>Apart from one man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/man-stabbed-tackling-southport-killer-scene-horror-jonathan-hayes\">injured in the attack</a>, it was a “notable feature” that all the other victims were female, he continued.</p> <p>The killer was jailed for life with a minimum term of 52 years in January at Liverpool crown court, after admitting the murders and attempted murders, described in court as “sadistic”.</p> <p>One part of the inquiry will be Rudakubana’s internet use and purchase of weapons, posing as an adult and using a false name. Moss said: “AR’s purchase of weapons is important because it will highlight vulnerabilities in the law against the purchase of knives, crossbows and machetes.”</p> <p>Rudakubana also bought seeds through Amazon, which he used to make a “crude preparation of ricin”, Moss said.</p> <p>He said the inquiry had requested detailed statements from Rudakubana’s parents “and will seek to explore their awareness of AR’s online orders and the items that AR stored in his bedroom and the living room of their home”.</p> <p>A central theme of the inquiry would be which bodies or agencies “took ownership” for intervening to address the risks that Rudakubana had demonstrated in his behaviour before the crimes.</p> <p>Before Moss spoke, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Adrian Fulford, promised to do everything “humanly possible” to answer the questions of bereaved families and victims.</p> <p>On Monday, the inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/15/southport-attack-inquiry-hears-parents-memories-of-their-daughters\">heard harrowing testimony</a> from the parents of the three murdered girls – Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.</p> <p>Impact evidence has also been heard from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/girl-saved-sisters-life-by-shielding-her-from-southport-attacker-inquiry-hears\">families of the other children</a> present on the day and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/southport-attack-inquiry-testimony-dance-teachers\">injured adults</a>.</p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The claim is central to rationales for arming Israel even as leading human rights groups decry genocide in Gaza</p>",
    "content": "<p>More than nine months after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza\">Human Rights Watch</a> issued reports that concluded Israel was committing genocide – and more than a month since key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/28/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-say-israel-based-human-rights-groups\">Israeli human rights groups asserted</a> the same – the American political establishment remains in rigid denial while horrors continue nonstop in Gaza. Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats in Congress still support massive US arms shipments to Israel, so they certainly can’t admit that the weaponry is making genocide possible.</p> <p>Central to rationales for arming Israel is the claim that it is the nation of “the Jewish people”.</p> <p>When the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke via video to a conference in Jerusalem three months ago, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=gw27xba40xE\">declared</a>: “There can be no nuanced separation of hatred of Israel and hatred of the Jewish people.” Rubio added: “Those who call for the destruction of Israel are calling for the destruction of the Jewish people.” Last month, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, reinforced the same message while visiting Israel, where he reportedly <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-08-04/ty-article/.premium/u-s-house-speaker-says-west-bank-rightful-property-of-jewish-people-at-settler-confab/00000198-7541-d3a7-af9e-776713fe0000\">said</a> that the West Bank is “the rightful property of the Jewish people”.</p> <p>Such rhetoric – equating Israel with all Jews and Israel’s future with theirs – is an effort to sanctify Israel and shield it from criticism by brandishing the charge of antisemitism.</p> <p>Fusing Israel with “the Jewish people” is a key propaganda technique. The fact that it’s so ubiquitous makes it no less ridiculous, or dangerous. A comment attributed to Voltaire applies: “As long as people believe in absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities.”</p> <p>And atrocities continue with no end in sight. Israel <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-182-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem\">has persisted</a> with methodical – and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/01/gaza-israeli-killings-of-palestinians-seeking-food-are-war-crimes\">clearly intentional</a> – killing of Palestinian civilians not only with bombs, missiles and bullets but also with <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israels-use-starvation-weapon-war-has-pushed-gaza-breaking-point\">starvation as a weapon of war</a>. Blockage or <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/september/israels-siege-now-blocks-83-of-food-aid-reaching-gaza-new-data-reveals\">extreme constriction</a> of humanitarian aid has been the norm. All summer, Israel has ignored the United Nations <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164076\">warning</a> issued in June that food intake in Gaza had dropped far below “survival” level. By then, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq0gy82wjo\">said</a> conditions there had become worse than “hell on earth”.</p> <p>Ironically, the country that we’re told is the ultimate target of antisemitism is now, in reality, the world’s most powerful <em>cause </em>of antisemitism. By insisting that it is the embodiment of Jews all over the world, the state of Israel seeks to associate Jews everywhere with its systematic <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-ehud-olmert-thinks-his-country-is-committing-war-crimes\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/opinion/israel-gaza-holocaust-genocide-palestinians.html\">genocide</a> in Gaza along with <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/attacks-on-palestinians-intensifying-in-occupied-west-bank-un-rights\">deadly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-ethnic-cleansing-forced-displacements-gaza-human-rights-watch-rcna180098\">ethnic cleansing</a> of Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/03/tragedy-foretold-and-stain-our-collective-humanity-special-rapporteur-warns\">in the West Bank</a>.</p> <p>The Israeli government, esteemed by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n90g6v9qo\">dwindling number</a> of Americans, conflates itself with Judaism and “the Jewish people” in a marketing pattern so familiar that it blends into the wallpaper of media echo chambers. The crux of pro-Israel messaging is to promote a set of false equations: Israel = Jews. Support for Israel = support for Jews. Denunciations of Israel = antisemitism. And a functional subtext of those equations is this one: Israeli government = impunity.</p> <p>During the 1980s, when activists in the United States and elsewhere targeted apartheid South Africa with non-violent campaigns for boycotts, divestment and sanctions, those actions did not provoke charges of being anti-white. In this century, the nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has targeted Israel, a country condemned as an apartheid state by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution\">one</a> human rights organization after <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid\">another</a> after <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/\">another</a> – and BDS supporters, even if Jewish, routinely face accusations of antisemitism. In Congress, the accusers include many liberal Democrats. The American Jewish Committee is one of many sizable groups that have long been <a href=\"https://www.ajc.org/news/bds-is-antisemitic\">flatly declaring</a> that “BDS is antisemitic”.</p> <p>Six decades ago, as a child going to Hebrew school, I couldn’t have imagined that the Jewish faith and reverence for Israel would become so manipulated. When I asked neighbors to put coins into a blue-and-white can so more trees could be planted in Israel, little did I know that the Israeli government would relentlessly kill, maim and terrorize Palestinian civilians in the name of protecting Jews. Nor did I have any inkling that the dignity and spirituality of Judaism would be twisted and desecrated by Israel with policies of genocide.</p> <p>One of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/\">Basic Laws</a>, enacted in 2018, says: “the State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people,” adding: “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” This is codification of standard assertions from the Israeli government and its ardent boosters doing all they can to hijack Judaism – claiming to speak for the world’s Jews, whether they like it or not.</p> <p>Increasingly, they don’t. <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-american-jews-are-turning-away-israel\">Polling</a> shows <a href=\"https://jcpa.org/survey-among-american-jews-over-51-support-for-bidens-decision-to-withhold-arms-shipments-to-israel/\">major opposition</a> to core Israeli policies among Jewish people in the US.</p> <p>All too often, US government officials amplify the senseless trope that Israel is the guarantor of safety for Jews worldwide. Speaking at a Hanukkah party at the White House in December 2023, former president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/user-clip-were-there-no-israel-there-wouldnt-be-a-jew-in-the-world-that-is-safe/5097513\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, there wouldn’t be a Jew in the world that is safe.” The remarkable assertion, which met with loud applause and cheers, was hardly a one-off. Three months earlier, Biden had <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-roundtable-discussion-with-jewish-community-leaders\">said</a>: “Were there no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It’s the only ultimate guarantee.”</p> <p>The US Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, writes in his new book Antisemitism in America: “There is a special and almost indescribable pride that comes from knowing, despite all the horrors, that after two millennia of wandering the desert, the Jewish people would finally return home.” It’s a classic conceit of claiming to speak for “the Jewish people” and insisting that Israel is their actual homeland – no matter where they live on the planet.</p> <p>The biggest Jewish organizations in the US automatically extol the Israeli government, regardless of what it does. And, as Peter Beinart <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/opinion/israel-state-jewish.html\">wrote</a> this year: “American Jewish leaders don’t just insist on Israel’s right to exist. They insist on its right to exist as a Jewish state. They cling to the idea that it can be both Jewish and democratic despite the basic contradiction between legal supremacy for one ethno-religious group and the democratic principle of equality under the law.”</p> <p>More insidious is the unspoken assumption that, after all is said and done, Jewish lives are intrinsically much more valuable than other lives in general and Palestinian lives in particular, while Israel’s destiny is transcendent. It’s a mindset that Beinart decries in his new book Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: “No matter how many Palestinians die, they do not tip the scales, because the value of a Palestinian is finite and the value of a Jewish state is infinite … Worshipping a country that elevates Jews over Palestinians replaces Judaism’s universal God – who makes special demands on Jews but cherishes all people – with a tribal deity that considers Jewish life precious and Palestinian life cheap.”</p> <p>Such worshipping of Israel fuels the pernicious concept that “the Jewish people” are synonymous with Israel. Any such claim can only be destructive, especially with Israel shamelessly engaged in ethnic cleansing, mass murder and genocide.</p> <ul> <li><p>Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

He was also booked in connection with images on his cellphone depicting child abuse, said state authorities, who took Zinn into custody after he was released from a hospital that was treating him for a medical condition.</p> <p>Documents filed in Zinn’s case by UVU campus police allege that he began screaming, “I shot him – now shoot me,” in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s killing at Utah Valley University (UVU) on 10 September. Video of officers holding Zinn down was widely circulated online, leading some to believe that authorities had quickly arrested a suspect in the killing of the conservative political activist.</p> <p>Then, when asked by an officer where the gun used to kill Kirk was, Zinn allegedly replied: “I am not going to tell you.” Police contend that Zinn subsequently admitted that he was not the shooter and did not know who was – and he purportedly claimed that he had acted how he did to draw attention away from the real killer in hopes of becoming “a martyr” for Kirk.</p> <p>Zinn was later brought to a hospital and told officers he was “glad he said he shot the individual so the real suspect could get away”, according to police documents.</p> <p>He allegedly was reluctant to let investigators look at his phone, saying he used the device “to look at child sexual abuse material”, local sheriff’s deputies wrote in a separate report, as the Utah news outlet <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/51373320/man-claimed-to-shoot-charlie-kirk-to-draw-attention-from-the-real-shooter-police-say\">KSL</a> noted. A search of Zinn’s phone allegedly confirmed there were more than 20 images depicting child abuse, including of minors believed to be about 5 years old – as well as explicit messages about sexual acts.</p> <p>Ultimately, authorities arrested Zinn on counts of obstruction of justice linked to the aftermath of Kirk’s killing and sexual exploitation of a minor for the alleged content on his phone.</p> <p>Police announced the arrest of Kirk’s actual suspected killer on Friday after a two-day manhunt. He has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, of Washington county, Utah, about 260 miles south of UVU.</p> <p>Zinn has a history of criminal charges and convictions in Utah over the previous three decades,<a href=\"https://ksltv.com/local-news/utah-man-who-falsely-claimed-he-shot-charlie-kirk-booked-into-jail/819948/\"> according to KSL</a> and other local media reports. Notably, in 2013, he was arrested on allegations that he asked Salt Lake City, Utah, marathon organizers if he could help set up bombs at the finish line.</p> <p>The deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds of others had been days earlier.</p> <p>Citing information from a district attorney whose office had previously prosecuted him, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Zinn was “politically conservative, leaning libertarian”.</p> <p>On Monday, a judge ordered Zinn be held without bail, according to online court records. Robinson is expected in court Tuesday to face formal murder charges.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/young-climate-activists-lawsuit-trump-fossil-fuels",
    "description": "<p>Group of activists, who range in age from seven to 25, include plaintiffs who won landmark climate case in Montana two years ago</p>",
    "content": "<p>Youth climate activists are taking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> to court this week over its anti-environment agenda.</p> <p>In a two-day hearing in Missoula, Montana, starting Tuesday, the young activists, who are between seven and 25, will argue that a federal judge should block three of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump’s</a> pro-fossil fuel executive orders.</p> <p>The hearing, which follows the filing of litigation in May, will mark the first time a federal court hears live testimony in a youth-led constitutional climate case.</p> <p>The lawsuit specifically targets executive orders declaring a “national energy emergency” and aiming to “unleash American energy”, and another April order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the most polluting and costliest fossil fuel. Those actions, they will say, constitute unlawful executive overreach and violate the state-created danger doctrine, a legal principle meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens.</p> <p>“At a time when we need to reduce fossil fuel reliance, the federal government is actively setting us back with these executive orders designed to unleash fossil fuels,” Georgi Fischer, a plaintiff in the case, told the Guardian. “It’s incredibly important for us to fight back against these unconstitutional attacks on our rights to life and liberty.”</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment, as well as the six agencies named as defendants. Alyse Sharpe, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, said: “We don’t comment on litigation.”</p> <p>The litigation was filed by non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order\">notched a landmark win</a> in the lawsuit Held v Montana, when a judge ruled that Montana’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated a group of youth plaintiffs’ rights under the state’s constitution. Some plaintiffs in the new federal litigation, including Fischer, were also challengers in the Montana case.</p> <p>“If the Held v Montana case taught me anything, it’s that our voices and stories can be incredibly powerful and so I’m hoping the court listens to us and understands how our lives and our futures are being harmed by these unconstitutional executive orders,” Fischer said.</p> <p>During the hearing this week, some of the plaintiffs will speak. They will be joined on the stand by five expert witnesses and six fact witnesses, including Columbia environmental economist Geoffrey Heal, Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor Mark Jacobson, global ecology expert Steven Running, and John Podesta, former White House senior advisor on clean energy under Joe Biden.</p> <p>“I’m proud to speak on behalf of these young plaintiffs about the devastating impact of these executive orders,” Podesta said in a statement. “The plaintiffs make a compelling case that these orders will only make the climate crisis worse, putting at risk the health, safety, and economic well-being of these young people as well as their families and communities.”</p> <p>The federal government will not call any witnesses.</p> <p>Last month, the federal government moved to dismiss the youth plaintiffs’ case. In an unusual move, Montana and a coalition of 18 other states plus Guam also called for <a href=\"https://www.publicjustice.net/states-guam-intervene-climate-lawsuit-trump-adminstration-fossil-fuels-executive-orders/\">the lawsuit’s dismissal.</a></p> <p>The lawsuit could face an uphill battle in court. A previous federal climate lawsuit filed by Our Children’s Trust ended in a denial from the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032425zor_q8l1.pdf?ref=climateinthecourts.com\">supreme court this year</a> after being filed a decade earlier.</p> <p>“These are always uphill battles, especially under a Trump administration determined to tilt the scales toward fossil fuels, but the constitution is clear: no president can sacrifice children’s rights and futures to prop up one industry,” said Mat dos Santos, Our Children’s Trust’s general counsel. “A victory would mean that even presidential power has limits, especially when children’s lives, health, and futures are at stake.”</p>",

I’ve worked so hard for it this year so I was able to hold on in that last 20m or so.”</p> <p>Like she did in her semi-final, Hull started the race behind the pack.

Reece Holder also had a valiant showing in the men’s 400m, finishing third in his semifinal but not quite delivering one of the two next fastest times that would have booked him a place in the final.</p> <p>After four days of competition, Australia has won two medals, both bronze, and sit 22nd in the medal tally. Victory in the men’s high jump by Olympic champion Hamish Kerr gave New Zealand their second gold, and their 14-strong team is now fourth in the medal tally behind only the United States, Kenya and Canada.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/nicholas-grimshaws-architecture-eden-project",
    "description": "<p>As well as the Eden Project, Grimshaw’s ambitious and audacious work on railway stations, airports, sports complexes and supermarkets could elevate even the most mundane experience</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/eden-project-architect-nicholas-grimshaw-dies-aged-85\">Eden Project architect Nicholas Grimshaw dies aged 85 – news</a> <br></p>",
    "content": "<p>‘I asked for the eighth wonder of the world and I got it,” declared Tim Smit, co-founder of the Eden Project designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, who has died at 85. In a Cornish china clay quarry, a cluster of geodesic domes resembling monumental soap bubbles enclose conservatories housing luxuriant plant eco-systems. Completed in 2000, it was one of Grimshaw’s most ambitious and audacious projects, seemingly springing from the mind of a science fiction novelist rather than an architect.</p> <p>But however thrillingly futuristic Grimshaw’s buildings appeared, they were grounded by an avid interest in engineering and craft, and how historic precedents could be transformed and adapted for the modern era. Instead of using glass for the Eden Project’s domes, Grimshaw employed gossamer-light foil cushions.</p> <p>When passenger rail services through the Channel tunnel first began operating in 1994, the British end was marked by a new international terminus at London’s Waterloo Station. Grimshaw conjured a radical reimagining of the Victorian iron and glass train shed that his 19th-century predecessors would immediately recognise. The inspiration for the roof’s asymmetrical arched form, a design feat made all the more complex by being curved on plan, was the skeleton of a human hand. Intricately pin-jointed to accommodate the deflection imposed by trains, a glazed roof vault encased platforms in a delicately transparent cocoon. Underneath, a sleek, airport-style concourse whisked passengers up to the platform.</p>    <p>Though it endured a forlorn period after Eurostar switched its operations to St Pancras in 2007, it has since been incorporated back into the main station as part of a major refurbishment, so that commuters heading for the home counties can experience the same frisson as those original Paris-bound adventurers.</p> <p>Hi-tech architecture was often calculated to appear at its best in a mechanistic, depopulated state, but Grimshaw’s output of stations, airports, trade fair halls, sports complexes and even the odd supermarket, civilised and elevated the everyday experience of catching a train or going shopping.</p>    <p>Part aircraft carrier, part aircraft hangar, Sainsbury’s Camden superstore (1988) was a muscular, metallic armature that brought a touch of Mad Max to the weekly shop. Grimshaw even designed a new kind of ramped travelator that locked on to shopping trolleys to convey customers down to the basement car park. It was characteristic of his attention to detail and confidence in technology to solve the most quotidian of problems.</p> <p>Early standout projects included Oxford Ice Rink (1984), a daring, column-free structure suspended by a cat’s cradle of cables from two towering masts and clad in silver panels more commonly used in cold stores. The Financial Times print works (1988) invigorated a bleak part of London’s terraforming Docklands by putting the<strong> </strong><em>ballet mécanique</em> of newspaper production on public view inside an immaculately engineered glass box. Passersby could watch the FT emerge each day in a Heath Robinson-style tableau of whirring machinery and pink newsprint.</p>    <p>Commissioned to design the British Pavilion for the 1992 Seville Expo, Grimshaw devised an elegant, modular structure topped by a rippling cockscomb of solar panels. These provided the energy to power a wall of water which cooled the pavilion and its visitors in Seville’s searing summer heat. The headquarters for the Western Morning News (1993) was conceived as a futuristic galleon in full sail on a hillside outside Plymouth, while in Berlin, the Ludwig Erhard Haus (1998), designed to house the reunified city’s Chamber of Commerce, was suspended from a ribcage of parabolic steel arches, hoisted into position as theatrically as the timber frames of a medieval barn.</p> <p>Railway stations were a recurring theme. After the success of Waterloo, Grimshaw went on to revitalise London’s Paddington (1999), stripping away accumulated accretions to reveal the engineering puissance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Latterly, towards the end of his career, his firm was given the herculean task of sorting out London Bridge, once described by John Betjeman as “the most complicated, muddled and unwelcoming of all London termini”. Where there was dinginess and disorder there is now clarity and connection, expressed in a cavernous new concourse and a concerto of escalators and lifts. Even Betjeman might be able to find his way around.</p>    <p>Another much larger London infrastructure project, the Elizabeth Line, won last year’s RIBA Stirling prize, shared with design team collaborators Maynard, Equation and AtkinsRéalis. “Descending into the colossal network of tunnels feels like entering a portal to the future, where the typical commuter chaos is transformed into an effortless experience,” said RIBA president Muyiwa Oki.</p> <p>Grimshaw was always keen to point out that technology evolves and circumstances change, but the trick is to produce architecture that is agile and adaptable. This was perhaps most persuasively demonstrated by the successful 2019 remodelling of the Herman Miller furniture factory to house the Bath Schools of Art and Design. Originally completed in 1976, when Grimshaw was in partnership with Terry Farrell, the archetypal slick industrial shed is now another kind of factory, an incubator for the processes of creation, making, experimentation and learning, showing that buildings could – and should – have second lives.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Giddy romantic fantasy sends its two commitment-phobe leads on a magical road trip through their pasts that may lead them back to love</p>",
    "content": "<p>Korean-American auteur <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3226379/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1\">Kogonada</a> has until now been known for his intriguingly complex, cerebral essayistic movies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/05/columbus-review-kogonada-john-cho\">Columbus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/21/after-yang-review-what-to-do-when-your-ai-robot-child-goes-wrong\">After Yang</a>, whose emotional content, though potent, isn’t immediately obvious. Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars. This is a musical without musical numbers (without its own musical numbers, anyway) and a romantic comedy mostly without comedy – an imbalance it shares with most romcoms in fact. The screenwriter is Seth Reiss, co-author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/the-menu-review-ralph-fiennes-celeb-chef-horror-comedy-cooks-nasty-surprises\">the (much chillier) drama The Menu</a>, with Ralph Fiennes as a scary chef.</p> <p>What Kogonada and Reiss are offering is a likably, if obtusely uncynical, heart-on-sleeve wish-fulfilment spectacular, which gradually retreats from its initial, borderline insufferable self-awareness. Or maybe it’s just that you get used to it. We are plunged into a woozy daydream as multicoloured as a ball pit in a kids’ play centre, all about love, relationships and the overwhelming importance of being open and risking emotional hurt to find the One. This involves coming to terms with your past and how you feel about your passionately remembered parents who are either dead or at any rate don’t tactlessly appear on screen in their present elderly form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoRfTjfh91o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YoRfTjfh91o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell play Sarah and David, two mind-blowingly attractive single professionals who meet and warily flirt at the wedding of mutual friends; when Sarah’s rental car breaks down afterwards, they wind up sharing David’s and go on a road trip together away from unhappy commitment-phobia and towards self-forgiveness and love.</p> <p>But that’s not the half of it. The rental car agency, run by two uber-zany comedy characters played by Kevin Kline and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (the latter dropping F-bombs and doing a wacky German accent that she snaps out of while musing on how we all perform roles), has given David a special 90s vintage Saturn with its own mystical GPS which guides the couple to various magic doors in the landscape. They go through these to primal scenes of their past: to encounters with their respective parents, to a Canadian lighthouse where David once epiphanically realised he wasn’t having an epiphany, to a modern art gallery which Sarah’s late mother loved in her too-good-to-be-true way and which they now visit (for some reason) in the pitch darkness with a torch, to two separate hospitals which might somehow be the same hospital, and to David’s high school where he fell unrequitedly in love with his leading lady while performing in their Broadway-level production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, in the film’s best scene.</p> <p>Kogonada’s previous film After Yang had distinct touches of Charlie Kaufman in its futurist drama about a family who have an intense emotional connection with the secondhand AI humanoid robot they buy as a companion-sibling for their adopted daughter. And this film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well … or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge’s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no.</p> <p>When recognisably real things happen they stand out very sharply. Sarah, on a capricious whim at the wedding, asks David to marry her and, after a moment in which you think David is going to take her up on it, to indulge this fantasy, he appears to think better of it and instead says coldly: “You’ve destroyed some men, haven’t you …” And when Sarah and David arrive at David’s high school and Sarah realises everyone thinks David is the teenager he was then, she asks his drama teacher how old he thinks she is, and he replies “40” – an outrageously ungallant estimate which infuriates her. But there is also sweetness and charm, not disenchantment, in the breath-holding competition to which Sarah challenges David in the car – a game her mother liked.</p> <p>The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.</p> <p>• A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is out on 18 September in Australia, and on 19 September in the UK and US.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It doesn’t have to be miserable. We asked experts how best to start training your new (or old) best friend</p>",
    "content": "<p>My family has never been closer to the brink of collapse than when we got a puppy. We spent hours reading articles and watching videos about puppy training, and were constantly arguing about the right way to potty train him or get him to stop barking.</p> <p>Every new piece of information seemed to contradict what we’d already learned – never scold him! Scold him! – but one thing was certain: make one wrong move and you will ruin your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/dogs\">dog</a> and your life forever.</p> <p>We had fallen into a common trap.</p> <p>“The No 1 mistake people make [when training] is thinking, I have to make my dog be perfect and sit all the time, instead of remembering why we got a dog and that we’re meant to have fun together,” says Amanda Gagnon, a zoologist, behavior consultant and dog trainer in New York City.</p> <p>Training is how a dog and a human learn to communicate with each other and build a relationship, says Gagnon. This is essential to a dog’s safety and happiness, but it doesn’t need to be a joyless chore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/28/its-all-about-tone-of-voice-three-dog-trainers-on-how-to-beat-behavioural-problems\">‘It’s all about tone of voice’: three dog trainers on how to beat behavioural problems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We talked to experts about how to start training your dog – in a way that won’t make you lose your mind.</p> <h2>Manage expectations</h2> <p>Between social media, Lassie reruns and basic perfectionism, humans can sometimes have unrealistic standards for dogs.</p> <p>“A lot of people get stuck on the Instagram-perfect dog that is always happy and never has negative emotions,” says Alex Sessa, the owner and head trainer of Peach on a Leash in Atlanta.</p> <p>But dogs are individuals with different personalities and needs. Maybe you wanted a dog that accompanies you to the farmer’s market every Saturday, but crowds make your dog feel stressed.</p> <p>That’s not a problem, says Sessa – people just need to adjust their expectations accordingly. “That’s still a great dog. There’s nothing wrong with the dog that doesn’t want to go everywhere with us,” she says.</p> <p>And expecting your dog to always be perfectly calm can lead to greater behavioral trouble down the road, says Gagnon.</p> <p>“When we don’t give our dogs outlets to express themselves as dogs – meaning barking and running and being bananas in general – those needs get suppressed, and when that happens, it’s like a powder keg that’s going to explode at any moment,” she says.</p> <h2>Give them time to settle in</h2> <p>Whether you’re bringing home a puppy or an adult dog, experts agree it is important to give them plenty of time to acclimate.</p> <p>“Don’t jump into too much obedience right away,” Sessa says. “We don’t want the dog to immediately feel like we’re barking commands at them and asking them to do a million things.”</p> <p>Adult dogs in particular can take up to three months to settle into a new home and show their true behavior pattern, says Ciera Moberg, a certified dog behavior consultant and co-founder of Instinct Dog Behavior &amp; Training in Washington DC. The way your dog acts the first day you bring them home might be completely different than the way they act on day 30.</p> <p>Once your dog is comfortable and you have a better understanding of their personality – what they enjoy, what makes them nervous – it will be easier to figure out how you want to focus your training.</p> <h2>Figure out what commands your dog really needs</h2> <p>Most people don’t need to teach their dog as many commands – some trainers call them cues – as they might think.</p> <p>“You only absolutely need two cues,” says Gagnong. “You need ‘sit’, and you need ‘come’.”</p> <p><strong>Sit. </strong>When a dog is sitting, “there are very few behavioral problems they can exhibit,” says Gagnon. “This is about getting them into a calm position.”</p> <p>To teach a dog to sit, say the word and then use a treat to get them into a sitting position, Gagnon says. Usually this can be done by showing them a treat and then moving it over and slightly behind their head, so when they track it with their nose, their head moves up and back and their rear drops.</p> <p><strong>Come.</strong> A recall cue is essential for safety. “Teaching a dog to come when called is about preventing them from running off into the road or into a dog fight,” says Gagnon.</p> <p>To teach a dog to come, you start by standing close to them, saying the cue, and giving them the treat when they come to you. Then you take a step back, and do the same thing. Over time, you call the dog from a greater and greater distance.</p> <p>Moberg says she also likes to teach dogs “touch”, where their nose presses into the palm of your hand.</p> <p>“It allows you to move the dog without having to physically manipulate their body,” she says.</p> <p>To train this, say the cue, hold an open hand out at snout level, and when your dog touches it with their nose, give them a treat. Repeat.</p> <p>Besides basic safety commands, think about training functionally, Sessa says. What is important for you and your dog’s life together? Maybe your dog never needs to be able to lie down, but they need to be able to walk well on a leash. “So focus on that,” says Sessa. “There’s no one-size-fits-all training regimen.”</p> <p>There’s no need to spend hours on training. Sessa says she usually suggests her clients work with their dogs for no more than 10 to 15 minutes a day.</p> <h2>For puppies: socialize, socialize, socialize</h2> <p>A lot of people think socializing a puppy means introducing them to as many other dogs as possible, says Gagnon. It’s actually a much broader task. “It’s about introducing them to everything that’s going to be a part of their world in a positive way,” Gagnon says.</p> <p>If you live in a loud, busy city, for example, it is important to help your puppy get used to loud city sounds. But don’t overdo it.</p> <p>“It’s not good socialization to take a puppy and put it down right next to a jackhammer,” says Gagnon. If a puppy seems scared or like they’re trying to hide, it is important not to push them or make them uncomfortable.</p> <p><strong>More from How to start:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/02/how-to-start-meditating\">How to start meditating</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training\">How to start weightlifting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/16/the-dreaded-b-word-how-to-start-budgeting\">How to start budgeting</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/20/how-to-start-sunning\">How to start running</a></p></li> </ul> <p>“You can put them two blocks away from the jackhammer and give them a treat while they’re hearing that sound, and that’s good socialization.”</p> <p>“Food is a great way to help your puppy feel better about things,” says Sessa. For example, if they’re meeting new people, have the strangers toss them a treat. “That helps them create a positive association,” she adds.</p> <p>Experts also suggest enrolling your dog in puppy classes or puppy social hours. However, poorly managed puppy groups can do more harm than good. A well-run class, Sessa says, will be small, have the dogs separated by size and collect the dogs’ vaccine records. It should also be moderated by a certified dog trainer.</p> <h2>Know when to call in a pro</h2> <p>At-home training can be beneficial, but in some situations, it is best to get help from a trainer.</p> <p>“If there’s anything dangerous, if there have been bites that have resulted in punctures, call a professional,” says Gagnon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/05/how-to-start-habit-activity-expert-tips\">How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something new</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s no need to wait until your dog is fully grown. In particular, if a puppy is having issues with biting, Gagnon suggests reaching out to a trainer, even just for a single session. Remote options are often available. “Half an hour online or with phone support can be relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of an aggression problem down the road,” she says.</p> <p>Professionals can also be helpful when dealing with anxious dogs, because anxiety “can be so case specific”, says Gagnon. For instance, you might think your dog is suffering separation anxiety, but your dog could be stressed about something else. A trainer can observe “and tell you what you’re dealing with”, Gagnon says.</p> <p>Finally, it’s important to pick a qualified behavior consultant or dog trainer. Sessa recommends looking for professionals who are credentialed with the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC).</p> <p>New dog owners can easily become overwhelmed by all the information and training options available, Sessa says. “Try not to get too caught up with what you’re seeing online. Those people haven’t interacted with your specific dog.”</p>",

He told journalists: “Israel categorically rejects the libellous rant published today by this commission of inquiry.”</p> <p>Israel has rejected the charge of genocide, citing its right to self-defence after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, andtook 251 hostages. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 64,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.</p> <h2>What the report says</h2> <p>To count as genocide under the 1948 UN genocide convention, adopted after the murder of 6 million Jewish people in the Holocaust, at least one of five acts must have occurred. The UN commission accuses Israel of committing four. It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses and doctors, verified open-source documents, reporting by media and NGOs, and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began.</p> <p>In the <strong>first category</strong><strong> of killing</strong>, the commission quotes UN reporting that as of 15 July 2025, at least 46% of Palestinians killed in Gaza were women and children. The commission also cited reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">the Guardian</a> based on Israeli intelligence that 83% of those killed in Gaza were civilians.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Israel has used heavy unguided munitions with a wide margin of error in densely populated residential areas … The number of bombs used by Israel since 7 October 2023 is extraordinary even in comparison to other world conflicts.</p> <p>Palestinians in Gaza were attacked in their homes, at hospitals, in shelters (including schools and religious sites), during the evacuations and in designated safe zones. At times, civilians, journalists, healthcare professionals, humanitarian workers and other protected persons were directly targeted and killed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission highlighted the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/im-so-scared-please-come-hind-rajab-six-found-dead-in-gaza-12-days-after-cry-for-help\">five children</a> when their family car was targeted near a petrol station in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City on 29 January 2024, noting that Israeli security forces fired on an ambulance, “preventing access to the victims”.</p> <p>It also pointed to casualties that resulted from tight restrictions on humanitarian aid – especially medicine and medical equipment – from entering Gaza, quoting an obstetrician who spoke about deaths of pregnant women he had treated, whom he referred to as “indirect victims of war”.</p> <p>The commission describes at length the killing of 15 paramedics by Israeli forces in southern Gaza in March and “notes the consistent pattern of conduct demonstrated by the Israeli security forces in the aftermath of attacks, in that they have often denied and shifted responsibilities until evidence that contradicts their narrative surfaced”, also pointing to an acute lack of accountability.</p> <p>The report said Israeli authorities knew of the high numbers of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023 but “did not intervene to change the means and methods of warfare employed [but] persisted over time and caused even more Palestinian deaths”.</p> <p>“The Commission therefore finds that the Israeli authorities intended to kill as many Palestinians as possible through its military operations in Gaza since 7 October 2023 and knew that the means and methods of warfare employed would cause mass deaths of Palestinians, including children,” it says.</p>    <p>Turning to the <strong>second category</strong> <strong>of acts that qualify as genocidal, causing serious bodily or mental harm</strong>, the commission highlighted the mistreatment of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqldpyn5ng6o\">Palestinian detainees</a> by Israeli security forces and mass displacement which, it said, “has caused serious and irreparable physical and mental harm to Palestinians in Gaza who have lost their homes and have been forced to live in inhumane conditions”.</p> <p>In the <strong>third category</strong><strong> of deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</strong>, the report noted that much of Gaza had been rendered virtually uninhabitable, that huge numbers of bakeries, schools, cultural sites and religious landmarks had been completely destroyed, and that attacks on hospitals had led to a collapse of the healthcare system. It also highlighted the recent declaration by respected UN-backed monitors of famine in parts of Gaza.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Considering the evidence in totality, the Commission has found that Israeli authorities were aware of the high probability that their military operations, the imposition of a total siege … and the destruction of housing and of health systems and facilities would lead to the physical destruction of Palestinians, in whole or in part, in Gaza … The Commission therefore finds that Israeli authorities knowingly and deliberately inflicted such conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.</p> </blockquote> <p>The section on the <strong>fourth category</strong><strong> of imposing measures intended to prevent births</strong> is more concise, and focuses largely on the high proportion of casualties who were children, and the attack in December 2023 against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15npnzpd08o\">al-Basma IVF clinic</a>, Gaza’s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed about 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.</p> <p>“It is reasonable to conclude that the Israeli security forces knew of the function of the clinic and intended to target it and destroy the reproductive material within,” the report concludes, adding that “the widespread and systematic targeting of children is part of a strategy to destroy the biological continuity and future existence of the Palestinian group in Gaza”.</p>    <h2>Intent</h2> <p>International law experts say that it is often difficult to support genocide charges because of the requirement to prove intent, or even in some circumstances, sole intent.</p> <p>The commission concluded that statements by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other officials were “direct evidence of genocidal intent”.</p> <p>The report cited his letter to Israeli soldiers in November 2023 comparing the Gaza operation to what the commission describes as a “holy war of total annihilation” in the Hebrew Bible.</p> <p>The report also named the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant.</p> <p>Navi Pillay, the South African former judge who is the most senior of the report’s three authors, headed a UN tribunal for Rwanda where more than 1 million people were killed in 1994.</p> <p>“The commission concludes that statements made by Israeli authorities are direct evidence of genocidal intent [and] also concludes that the pattern of conduct is circumstantial evidence for genocidal intent and that genocidal intent was the only reasonably inference that can be drawn from the totality of the evidence,” she told reporters on Tuesday.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Creative director Stuart Vevers appeals to gen z audience with ‘down-to-earth pieces’ for New York fashion week</p>",
    "content": "<p>New York fashion week is proving a particularly perplexing time for brands as they continue to grapple with <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/luxury-market-faces-first-slowdown-study-estimates-decrease-1237927288/\">a global slowdown</a>, leading many to question what luxury even means today.</p> <p>For some consumers, it is always going to be about a gleaming five-figure handbag. For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.</p> <p>However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.</p> <p>Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.</p>    <p>Welcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.</p> <p>On the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/the-lyst-index/the-lyst-index-q2-25/\">Lyst Index</a>, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/tapestrys-sales-rise-on-popularity-of-coach-brand-5744f87f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjWn5B7_FiKqywF7GVXo6XIdrBjmyxniTJN94yYGfC6xLGwm1_yWqoKvkoWKgc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c8d290&amp;gaa_sig=NOFi37IP8xHfJGqWZcxkkw24UUiGqcLcT7Mc_xbeA4g9afi9RLQkiMEU9b6RIaeN915EO4WcjFcD29omMaMy4g%3D%3D\">$1.43bn since January</a>. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.</p> <p>While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”</p> <p>Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”</p> <p>Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.</p> <p>Coach is also leaning into its 84-year history. Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.</p> <p>Lopez has used previous catwalks to highlight issues including immigration and homophobia. This time around, he said he wanted to “pay tribute to the syncretic spirit of the Dominican Republic”. Lopez, who is a third-generation Dominican, played with texture using feathers and beading to add depth to bodysuits and tailoring. He described the collection as a confrontation of “the brutal legacy of slavery – how it fractured bodies, families and futures – yet simultaneously birthed radical forms of creativity, expression and resistance”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Engineer whose recommendations after the Ladbroke Grove train crash led to improved safety on the railways</p>",
    "content": "<p>When David Davies, who has died aged 89, was asked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/21/lord-prescott-john-prescott-obituary\">John Prescott</a>, the then deputy prime minister and transport secretary, to undertake an inquiry into the safety system on Britain’s railways after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/05/the-ladbroke-grove-rail-disaster-lessons-to-be-learned-20-years-on\">Ladbroke Grove train crash of 1999</a>, the BBC could not conceal its excitement. The report said: “Sir David Davies may not be a household name, but he is among the few people that the term genius can be applied to without overstatement.”</p> <p>Davies – known universally as Den, taken from his initials – probably enjoyed this description. Aged 12, while at Llandaff Catholic school in Cardiff, he knocked on the headmaster’s door to complain he was not being intellectually challenged and asked, successfully, to be moved up to the next class. He went on to a glittering career in industry and academia.</p> <p>Consequently, described by his colleagues as utterly unflappable and always calm, he did not hesitate to take on the task offered by Prescott, which came at a crucial time in the midst of something of a national panic about the state of the railways. The Ladbroke Grove disaster, in which 31 people died, was the worst accident on the railways since 1988 and the second major crash caused by a train going past a red signal, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/21/keithharper\">Southall two years previously</a>. There was widespread concern among the public that the railways were not safe and that not enough was being done to improve the situation.</p> <p>Fortunately, Prescott avoided a kneejerk response to public outrage, and instead put his trust in Davies, who had the relevant experience for the job. He was not only at the time the president of the <a href=\"https://www.raeng.org.uk/\">Royal Academy of Engineering</a>, a fairly new national academy whose creation had been at the behest of Prince Philip, but he had also worked in British Rail’s research department in the late 1960s and was familiar with the workings of the railway. His approach was meticulous and at the time controversial.</p> <p>His report, published in early 2000, was a thorough assessment of the two main technologies that were capable of reducing the risk of drivers failing to stop at a red signal. At the time, the newly privatised railways were introducing a fairly simple Train Protection &amp; Warning System, which was very effective but did not prevent certain types of overrun, notably if trains were going particularly fast. However, because the alternative system, Automatic Train Protection, was several times more expensive and would take far longer to install across the network, Davies strongly recommended the former, arguing that it would ultimately save more lives because of its rapid implementation.</p>    <p>The intervening quarter of a century has proved that he was right. The number of signals passed at danger on the railways has been reduced dramatically and, while there has been the occasional near miss, there has been no major accident involving signalling on the railways since then. His approach, of getting a good system implemented quickly rather than a perfect one brought in more slowly, was proved to be a brilliant judgment.</p> <p>Davies later briefly chaired an organisation called Railway Safety, which was set up to promote safety issues, and he focused on the poor state of much of the fencing protecting the tracks. This came to the fore after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/28/selby-rail-crash-driver-fate\">the 2001 Selby train crash</a>, when a Land Rover tumbled down an embankment and caused two trains to collide, killing 10 people.</p> <p>Born in Cardiff, to Sarah (nee Samuel) and David Davies, an estate agent, David Jr studied electrical engineering at the University of Birmingham, and was awarded his PhD in 1960; he later joined the staff. He met his future wife, Enid Patilla, there, but waited seven years before proposing to her as, he revealed later, he wanted to make sure he could provide for his future family. After several academic posts, notably at University College London and Loughborough University, where he was vice-chancellor, he became chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence in 1993, and the following year was knighted.</p> <p>While his Ladbroke Grove report was his most publicised work, it should not overshadow Davies’s remarkable achievements in scientific research, which was the source of the BBC’s approbation. His research work was varied, covering work in antenna arrays, radar, signal processing and optical fibres.</p> <p>It was the developments in the last of these that were particularly groundbreaking, as he invented fibreoptic sensors, which could provide sensitive measurement of quantities such as strain or temperature, and could even be the basis of a kilometre-long microphone with high dynamic range. All this was despite the fact that fibreoptic cables were at the time being championed in telecommunications for their insensitivity to disturbances and therefore unable to be used in this way. His research opened up a huge potential market for the wide use of fibreoptics.</p> <p>Consequently, for this work he won the Rank prize for optoelectronics in 1984. He later also won the Institution of Electrical Engineers’ Faraday medal in 1987. He served on the committees of many national bodies, including the BBC engineering advisory committee and the Royal Society’s science inquirycommittee.</p> <p>Enid died in 1990. In 1992 he married Jennifer Rayner, a chartered surveyor. She survives him, as do his two sons, Michael and Christopher, from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter, Ruth.</p> <p>• David Evan Naunton Davies, engineer and government adviser, born 28 October 1935; died 19 August 2025</p>",

    "description": "<p>Data public health experts say is worrisome will reportedly be presented to ACIP later this week before vote on shots</p>",
    "content": "<p>US health officials are reportedly planning to release data on child deaths and serious side effects they would attribute to Covid-19 vaccines, raising alarm among public health experts who say the publicly available data does not support these claims and the report may lead to increased anti-vaccine sentiment.</p> <p>Independent advisers for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) later this week plan to revisit recommendations for Covid shots as well as vaccines for measles and hepatitis B.</p> <p>The move is part of a larger effort to cast doubt on vaccines and reduce access to them, said David Gorski, a professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University who has <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/david-gorski/\">tracked</a> anti-vaccine activism for decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/cdc-leadership-loss-experts-alarmed\">‘Americans should be alarmed’: Experts say loss of expertise at CDC will harm US health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is a longtime anti-vaxxer who continues to make sweeping, controversial changes to the US vaccine program, Gorski said.</p> <p>“RFK Jr wants to take away your vaccines,” he said.</p> <p>Officials are looking at 25 reports of pediatric deaths following Covid vaccination, apparently stemming from the crowdsourced database known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/\">reporting</a> by the Washington Post.</p> <p>Yet years of data and research show that Covid vaccinations are safe and effective.</p> <p>“Covid vaccination involved much larger numbers of people receiving vaccines than we’ve had for anything in history,” said Anne Schuchat, a former principal deputy director of the CDC.</p> <p>Using VAERS to cast doubt on the safety of vaccines is a decades-long anti-vax tactic, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16452357/\">research</a> has shown a spike in reports related to litigation, Gorski said.</p> <p>While the system can help discover red flags, Schuchat noted it can’t be used to demonstrate causality.</p> <p>“Anybody can report into it,” she said – including patients, family members, lawyers, friends and people on social media. One doctor successfully submitted a report on his transformation into the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060427200248/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism\">Incredible Hulk</a>.</p> <p>The child deaths report is expected to be presented at the meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) later this week.</p> <p>Staff at the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process”, said Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson, in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>“Until that is shared publicly, any of this should be considered pure speculation.”</p> <p>ACIP will vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth, and Covid vaccines – and it will also hold votes for the Vaccines for Children program, which provides shots to nearly half of children in the US.</p> <p>It’s not clear what the ACIP votes will entail, but experts believe some of the shots may be restricted and others may lose their recommendation, which would affect insurance coverage – especially from Medicaid and Medicare.</p> <p>“If it’s not on the CDC recommended schedule, then insurance companies don’t have to pay for it,” Gorski said. “Federal government programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not pay for it, the Vaccines for Children program will not pay for it. Now, insurance companies might decide to pay for it anyway, at least within the FDA guidelines, but there’s no guarantee that they all will.”</p> <p>On Monday, days before the ACIP meeting is set to begin, HHS announced five more advisers, some of whom have a history of troubling statements on vaccines and infectious disease.</p> <p>There are other safety systems to flag side effects, like the Vaccine Safety Datalink, that are confirmed by medical records and also provide comparisons to understand if an unanticipated adverse event is linked to vaccines, Schuchat said. It’s not clear if the report will pull from these sources.</p> <p>“We are getting the data that was never made available before, including adverse event data,” Marty Makary, head of the FDA , told CNN earlier this month.</p> <p>Those possible adverse events include “young people who have died from the Covid vaccine”, he added. “And we’re going to make that available to the medical community in full transparency, because this is the question that Americans are asking.”</p> <p>Kennedy’s team at HHS reportedly requested full access to VAERS, including the ability to modify the database.</p> <p>“We allowed them to have read access but would not give them write access,” said Peter Marks, the former vaccines chief at FDA.</p> <p>Reports of death, especially among children, would be “the top priority” for health officials, said Gorski.</p> <p>Any reports of serious side effects are investigated by officials at the CDC and FDA, said Schuchat.</p> <p>“There is a deep look into the death of a child or particularly worrisome reports,” she said.</p> <p>Now, the FDA seems to be reopening these reports. It’s not clear whether the FDA is doing anything differently with these investigations now, or how they would reclassify deaths as vaccine-related.</p> <p>“Anything’s possible,” Schuchat said. “We’re in new territory right now.”</p> <p>FDA could also temporarily pull the licenses of Covid vaccines while it investigates potential events, or it could add a black-box warning about the purported risks of the vaccine.</p> <p>Yet the FDA recently granted full licensure to Covid vaccines <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/drdemetre.bsky.social/post/3lynsfagw4s24\">without raising concerns</a> about credible safety issues.</p> <p>Changes to the CDC’s recommendations could instead limit the vaccines until most people can’t access them, Gorski said. “My fear is that within a year, the Covid vaccines will be gone, for all intents and purposes.”</p> <p>Anti-vax officials seem to view the Covid shots as a “test case” or a template for restricting access to other vaccines, Gorski said, before adding that the hepatitis B vaccine currently given at birth may lose its recommendation as soon as this week.</p> <p>More than 1,000 current and former HHS employees have called for Kennedy’s resignation because of moves like this – including Schuchat.</p> <p>“It’s really scary, the actions he’s taking and the people he seems to be trusting,” she said of Kennedy. “This person has so much authority right now.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a tough week for Labour, Donald Trump is touching down for a state visit. Let’s hope the PM can stomach it</p>",
    "content": "<p>Quick update on Keir Starmer’s government of “national renewal”: having just lost his deputy and housing secretary over her failure to pay the required stamp duty, the prime minister has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">lost his US ambassador</a> over his known close association with a known paedophile sex trafficker. Hang on – he’s now also lost his director of political strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/senior-starmer-adviser-paul-ovenden-quits-over-offensive-diane-abbott-messages\">relating some dirty jokes</a> about Diane Abbott.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an increasing number of people think the solution to all this is Andy Burnham taking over, suggesting the current Greater Manchester mayor could run in a parliamentary seat that has only notionally become free because the previous Labour MP was suspended from the party after being found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/10/labour-was-told-about-vile-whatsapp-group-more-than-a-year-ago-says-ex-councillor\">sent messages</a> hoping a couple of constituents would soon be dead/“mown down”, and is now apparently “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLVgxUGIodU/\">off sick</a>”. On top of which, we’re having the Americans round. US president Donald Trump touches down in the UK tonight on the eve of the most hideously ill-starred dinner party since the vomiting scene in Triangle of Sadness. I don’t think the nation could possibly feel any more renewed.</p> <p>It’s been a few days since Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein were held up in front of the public using the hazmat tongs, and the more I’ve thought about them, the more I come back to one of the more obscure lines. Writing in apparent anguish on the eve of Epstein’s incarceration in 2008, Mandelson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/peter-mandelson-messages-jeffrey-epstein-disturbing-and-sickening-says-minister\">opines to him</a>: “It just could not happen in Britain.” Maybe he was right, unwittingly or otherwise. Britain is very, very good at a sort of institutionalised looking away. Maybe Mandelson was – unwittingly or otherwise – characterising something grim about this country that pious old Keir Starmer would no doubt be hugely affronted to be caught up in. Except, the prime minister <em>is</em> caught up in it – in fact, he’s at the very centre of it. He is the one who looked away.</p> <p>It’s hard not to feel there is something necrotic and beaten about a government whose leader would appoint someone he knew had been very close to Epstein, who the entire world by that point knew was – and forgive me for repeating the words – a paedophile sex trafficker. Association with him was already known to be such a horror show that the late Queen Elizabeth II had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/chucked-under-royal-bus-prince-andrews-demotion-shows-institutions-ruthlessness\">sack her own son</a> for it. And there is something worse about Starmer’s horrifying lack of curiosity even as the facts closed in, right till the bitter end, with No 10 dithering for staggeringly long last week over a set of quite the most disqualifying emails, while Starmer fannied about defending Mandelson at the dispatch box.</p> <p>This was, of course, the other dispatch box to the one at which Sir Keir plied his holier-than-thou trade in opposition. There’s an old online rule that declares that if you tell someone off for their spelling or grammar, you will always end up making your own howler while you’re doing it. Starmer spent his years in opposition telling off the Tories at every turn, instead of – for instance – coming up with a creative and coherent plan for growth. Inevitably, we now seem to be strapped in to watching him and his administration warrant a daily telling-off, as offences and immoralities mount up. Why does this keep happening to him, etc?</p> <p>As for Epstein, we know that at the time Mandelson was writing to him telling him to fight for early release, police in Palm Beach, Florida had identified 36 girls<strong> </strong>who the “financier” had sexually abused. Yet for all the many years of grim and grotesque revelations, it still feels as though we know remarkably little about him. Who was he, this mysterious paedo Gatsby, and where did all his money come from?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/peter-mandelson-keir-starmer-labour\">It’s over and out (again) for Mandelson, but how many political lives does Starmer have left? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly after his death, New York magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/hedge-funders-have-some-thoughts-on-what-epstein-was-doing.html\">ran a fascinating story</a> in which real hedge-funders expressed pointed bemusement over how Epstein made his money, since none of them had really had any dealings with him. As one big hedge-fund president, Doug Kass, put it: “I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested. Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.” As Kass had said to a journalist: “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” Or as another hedgie remarked: “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” And yet Epstein had made no noise at all in the financial world. They could barely find one investor. Their general theory was that the “hedge fund” was simply a cover for a blackmail scheme.</p> <p>Perhaps most amazing, really, is the fact that Epstein will be a ghost at the feast tomorrow night for more than one attender, as Trump continues to butch out his long and close association with precisely the type of evildoer his Maga followers are convinced runs the world. Epstein is a guy who really does fit the very template of their darkest conspiracy theories – rich and powerful, involved in the trafficking of minors, connected in a network of some of the most powerful people in the world. This is all the sort of stuff they’ve been going on about for years – yet who should keep rearing his head in the story, but their own beloved president.</p> <p>Isn’t it intriguing how many of them (currently) just can’t bring themselves to believe it? Something to discuss over the starter tomorrow night at Windsor Castle, perhaps, as long as everyone can keep their food down.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "<p>A play by the Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/29/black-panther-actor-chadwick-boseman-dies-of-cancer\">died of cancer aged 43</a> in 2020, is to receive its UK premiere next year.</p> <p>Deep Azure was written by Boseman in response to the death of Prince Jones, his fellow college student at Washington DC’s Howard University, who was killed in 2000 by a police officer. The play was first performed in 2005 in the US and will be staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in February, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/02/chadwick-boseman-theatre-black-panther\">‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick Boseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fynn-Aiduenu described the play as “incredibly poignant in speaking about the injustices of police brutality and the unwinding nature of grief, but also the gorgeous brilliance of our Black Souls and exploring every hue they can express on a stage”. He said that Boseman’s love of Shakespeare and hip-hop combined in a “layered, ghostly epic that I have been given the privilege and duty to fully realise”.</p> <p>Boseman was best known for his performance in the title role of Marvel’s Black Panther, and was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10514222/?ref_=nmawd_awd_1\">Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</a>, based on August Wilson’s play. But before he rose to fame as an actor, he had shown himself to be a promising playwright.</p> <p>The director Derrick Sanders, another Howard University alumnus who commissioned Deep Azure, told the Guardian in 2020 that Boseman took the elements of hip-hop culture – graffiti, DJing, rapping, breakdancing – “and combined them into a narrative form. The storytelling would move it in and out of hip-hop, almost as a precursor to Hamilton.”</p> <p>Boseman studied Shakespeare at Oxford University with the British American Drama Academy in 1998. He had wanted to make a film of Deep Azure before his Hollywood career exploded. Daniel Banks, who directed the play at the <a href=\"https://www.folger.edu/folger-theatre\">Folger theatre in Washington DC</a>, said that it was “written as a ritual of community healing”. The killing of Jones by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000 was also covered by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates in the 2015 book Between the World and Me. In 2006, after a civil trial, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/25/AR2006092501456.html\">damages were awarded</a> to Jones’s young daughter for his wrongful death.</p> <p>Deep Azure will run from 7 February to 11 April in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the indoor candlelit venue run by Shakespeare’s Globe. It will be performed alongside a new production of The Tempest (17 January to 12 April) directed by Tim Crouch, who will play Prospero alongside Naomi Wirthner (How to Train Your Dragon)<em><strong> </strong></em>as Ariel.</p> <p>Crouch is the creator of a series of acclaimed Shakespearean dramas presented from the perspective of the plays’ minor characters, including I, Caliban and I, Banquo. He said he had “been given the keys to the most interesting theatre in London. The spaces at the Globe are not anonymous black boxes that try to disappear as soon as the play begins. They are companions to any work that happens in them; good companions which support and contribute to the stories that they house.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The year is 2125 and an AI-powered hologram of Elon Musk is CEO of The World, Inc. Nation states are defunct and “citizens” an outdated concept. Now people function more like non-voting shareholders of heavily armed corporations. Anyone who dares to criticise Lord Musk is sentenced to death in a burning Tesla.</p> <p>This isn’t my poor attempt at science fiction (apart from some creative licence around the AI Musk and Tesla executions). Rather, it’s a simplified approximation of the world Curtis Yarvin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html\">Silicon Valley’s favourite thinker</a>, wants to usher in. Yarvin, whose “dark enlightenment” ideas have influenced the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552\">Trump administration</a> and political kingmakers <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2022/05/the-strange-and-terrifying-ideas-of-neoreactionaries\">such as Peter Thiel</a>, believes super-rich elites should have dictatorial powers; universities and the press shouldn’t hold any sway; and the hoi polloi should suck it all up.</p> <p>Musk is not a straightforward disciple of Yarvin, but both believe governments should be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-trumps-reign-fits-curtis-yarvins-blueprint-of-a-ceo-led-american-monarchy-what-is-technological-fascism-256202\">treated as corporations</a> and share disdain for liberal democracy and “woke” institutions. Both also have a raze-and-rebuild approach to the world. Indeed, long before Musk launched his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Yarvin devised <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/08/curtis-yarvin-doge-musk-thiel/\">Rage</a>, a plan to “retire all government employees”. Yarvin, by the way, wasn’t impressed with Doge (he compared it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner) because it didn’t grab enough power.</p> <p>I bring all this up because, as Musk vies for a larger role on the world stage, it’s imperative we’re clear about what he’s trying to achieve. The billionaire, who spent <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">more than $290m</a> (£210m) influencing the US election, is increasingly taking his political meddling worldwide: he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/canada-election-elon-musk-justin-trudeau\">inserted himself into Canadian politics</a> earlier this year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/elon-musk-afd-germany-mainstream-far-right\">helped boost</a> Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk spent January posting about grooming gangs in the UK and turned his attention back to the country over the weekend, appearing via video at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">far-right rally</a> in London. Musk called for a “change of government” and said: “Violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” A man who was born in South Africa but emigrated to the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/canada-musk-petition-revoke-citizenship-00205964\">by way of Canada</a> wants Britons to be terrified of foreigners.</p> <p>So what’s the end goal here? Is Musk being guided by a Yarvinesque ideology or is this just what happens when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/elon-musk-trump-drug-use\">industrial amounts of ketamine</a> the billionaire is reported to have consumed interact with the world’s largest ego?</p> <p>While a God complex may be at play, a politics of chaos appears to be Musk’s short-term goal. It feels increasingly as if the tech mogul is trying to stoke civil unrest and destabilise democracies worldwide so he can accumulate more power. In his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">new year address</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">Robert Habeck</a>, Germany’s vice-chancellor at the time, came to a similar conclusion, calling Musk’s support for the AfD a “logical and systematic” play to weaken Europe. “A weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power,” Habeck said.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s weaknesses – his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">approval rating</a> is dismal – certainly seem to have captured Musk’s interest. Musk may not have an ideology as developed as Yarvin’s, but it does feel as if he’s attempting to become de facto CEO of the world, with deputies around the globe. It’s not inconceivable that Musk could effect regime change in Britain. And I’m not sure the government is taking this threat seriously enough. At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-palestine-action-the-ban-on-gaza-activists-must-be-overturned\">pensioners are being arrested</a> for waving “Palestine Action” placards, the response to Musk’s calls for people to “fight back or … die” at a protest where 26 police officers were injured could have been somewhat more forceful. Starmer should impose sanctions on Musk, not just wag his finger at him.</p> <p>What’s really at issue here, however, is the system that produced Musk and enabled his meddling. A healthy democracy should have safeguards in place that ensure a handful of super-rich individuals can’t usurp the political process. Those safeguards were removed from the US in 2010 with the supreme court’s <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\">Citizens United ruling</a>, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and in effect allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Britain has nowhere near the amount of money sloshing through its politics as the US does, but an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/30/uk-political-donations-dark-money\">analysis last</a> year found dark money is rife: almost £1 in every £10 donated to British parties and politicians came from unknown or dubious sources.</p> <p>Musk is odious, but he is right that Britain is under threat: if we don’t fight to conserve democracy, it will die. However, the foreigners we should worry about are not desperate people on small boats, they’re billionaires with rocket ships.</p> <p><em>• </em>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Kipyegon delivered a gun-to-tape run that destroyed the field as she came home clear in 3 minutes 52.15 seconds. The world record holder matches Hicham El Guerrouj (1997-2003) by claiming four world 1,500m golds and she will also go for a second world 5,000m title later this week.

Orlando Bennett ran a personal best 13.08 to win silver, while his fellow Jamaican Tyler Mason took the bronze in 13.12, which matched his previous best time.

Should she win, the three-time Olympic and three-time world champion will draw level with Hicham El Guerrouj, who won this race at this meet on four occasions, and at 31, it’s incumbent upon us to savour her while we still can.</p> \n  <p>Or, in other words, Mondo needs to budge up, because there are others planning to take out a des res inside our heads.</p> \n  <p><strong>Action starts: 7.35pm local, 11.35am BST</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div>",

Deals involving Nvidia, the world’s largest AI chip maker, and OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI assistant, are anticipated.</p> <p>But campaigners have said a wave of massive new computer warehouses will crank up Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on finite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/22/ai-data-centre-power-consumption\">power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/17/ai-boom-environment-agency-cannot-predict-future-water-shortages-england-data-centres\">water resources</a>.</p> <p>If allowed, the Thurrock complex will include up to four datacentres on “grey belt” land part-occupied by a former speedway and stock car track.

Google’s planning application stresses this remains a “minor adverse and not significant impact when compared to the UK carbon budgets”, but campaigners disagree.</p> <p>“Google’s planned facility in Essex will produce carbon emissions several times higher than those of an international airport,” said a spokesperson for Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology. “But this is just one of many ‘hyperscale’ datacentres that US big tech wants to impose on the UK – in pursuit of their own profits and regardless of the cost to our environment.</p> <p>“Starmer’s government needs to stop bowing to the Trump-big tech agenda and start standing up for the interests of the UK public – otherwise we will all be paying for the tech giants’ datacentres, whether in terms of soaring energy bills, dwindling water supplies or a heating planet.”</p> <p>Datacentres now <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-01-27/debates/7D94F44D-EA1F-4D0F-87A8-2B5BCFD00DEF/InternetActivityEnergyUse\">consume about 2.5% of the UK’s electricity</a>, and demand on the grid is expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report\">to increase fourfold by 2030</a>, according to the House of Commons library.</p> <p>The British government does not believe datacentres will have a significant impact on the UK’s carbon budget because of its ambitious targets for electricity grid decarbonisation. Rather it is worried that without massive investment in new datacentres, the UK will fall behind international rivals, including France, resulting in a “compute gap” that “risks undermining national security, economic growth, and the UK’s ambition to lead in AI”, according to a July research paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.</p> <p>Other important datacentre projects include a £10bn scheme on the site of a former coal-fired power station near Blyth in Northumberland that was granted planning permission in March. It is poised to be at the heart of a UK-US deal involving Nvidia and OpenAI. It was also reported at the weekend that Google is in early-stage talks about building a mammoth datacentre on Teesside.</p> <p>Bain &amp; Company, a global business consultancy, said on Monday that AI and datacentres could account for 2% of global emissions and 17% of industrial emissions by 2035, with the impact highest in countries where fossil fuels still dominate power generation.</p> <p>Google declined to comment on its planning application for the Thurrock site. On Teesside, it said: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The thinking behind Sainsbury’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">£1bn-plus purchase of Argos back in 2016</a> wasn’t entirely other-worldly. The big idea was that, by putting Argos general merchandise shops within Sainsbury’s supermarkets, both chains would benefit via a customer crossover effect. But the problem was also screamingly obvious: why volunteer to step in front of Amazon’s non-food steamroller?</p> <p>Simon Roberts became chief executive of Sainsbury’s in 2020, replacing Mike Coupe, the architect of the Argos deal, and immediately indicated where he stood. His “food first” strategy wasn’t quite a declaration that he viewed Argos as inessential to the day job of competing with Tesco et al, but it wasn’t far off.</p> <p>Thus nobody was surprised by Sainsbury’s confirmation on Saturday that it was considering an approach for Argos from JD.com, the enormous Chinese retailer. The identity of the would-be buyer was logical – JD.com <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/19/currys-shares-soar-china-jd-com-takeover-battle-elliott\">publicly flirted with the idea of bidding for electrical chain Curry’s last year</a> and is still thought to be keen on a splashy entry into the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">Sainsbury’s talks to sell Argos to Chinese retailer JD.com collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunday, however, brought news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/sainsburys-talks-sell-argos-chinese-retailer-jdcom\">the talks were off</a> already because, said Sainsbury’s, JD.com would only engage on “materially revised terms and commitments”. In negotiation-speak, that’s like calling the other side a bunch of time-wasters. The talks look properly dead. Everybody knows Argos isn’t worth what it was in 2016, but it’s still a substantial business.</p> <p>There is still a possible upside to the messy weekend saga for those Sainsbury’s investors who view Argos as unwanted baggage. The mere fact of talks suggests Argos has not become so enmeshed in Sainsbury’s infrastructure that the business could never be separated and sold.</p> <p>Of the 664 Argos shops, 461 are within a Sainsbury’s store, so a divorce would still be tricky. But more and more of Argos’s trade is going online, so perhaps there is still somebody out there who would want the 200-odd rump stand-alone shops, allowing Sainsbury’s to take back its store space to put to better use.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s doesn’t reveal Argos’s profits, but <a href=\"https://corporate.sainsburys.co.uk/media/s4giiar0/j-sainsbury-plc_more-argos-more-often_nl24-2.pdf\">the detail-free charts</a> it occasionally publishes suggest margins are slim (certainly slimmer than in the supermarkets) and have been getting slimmer in recent years. On the other hand, turnover at Argos is almost £5bn and digitalisation has happened, so perhaps there is still an appeal for somebody.</p> <p>For Roberts, Argos is best viewed as a low-level headache. Its presence is annoying for shareholders who would prefer a pure grocery-only story, especially now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/20/natwest-buy-sainsburys-bank-deal\">Sainsbury’s has sold most of its bank</a>. But the core supermarket business isn’t obviously being distracted – and the weekend update confirmed this year’s expectations on operating profit and cashflow, which helped the share price. The worry is more the medium-term one that, one day, the demand on Argos to stand on its own feet internally will become impossible to maintain.</p> <p>It would have been better if Argos had never been bought in the first place because the competitive pressure in non-food is relentless. But it is still fair to turn down offers at silly prices. Roberts has a couple of years to find an alternative – either a self-help fix of Argos or a sale on respectable terms. The task is not easy, but nor should it be impossible.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dancer and later chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet who took leading roles at the Wallace Collection and then Strawberry Hill House in London</p>",
    "content": "<p>Derek Purnell, who has died aged 71 of a brain tumour, had a career focused on the arts and heritage encompassing both performance and administration. He had a true sense of purpose and the ability to inspire his colleagues, and always took an interest in their work.</p> <p>In 1991 he took up the position of chief executive of Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB), working alongside Peter Wright, the artistic director, and from 1995 with David Bintley. In a tribute, Bintley noted that the decade he worked alongside Purnell at the BRB was “the happiest and most fulfilling of my professional life”. Having danced with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, the touring wing of the Royal Ballet, for a decade from 1973, and having become a dancers’ union representative, when Purnell retired from performing he trained in arts administration at City, University of London. </p> <p>He then returned to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, where he managed the company’s 1988 tour to Asia, and was given the task of organising the relocation of the company to Birmingham to make its home at the Hippodrome. Knowing the working conditions dancers aspired to having danced at theatres with less-than-ideal backstage facilities, he ensured appropriate studios and custom-built facilities were provided there. </p>    <p>He became a valued ambassador for Birmingham as a place to work, reassuring the dancers and staff who would be leaving London. In 1990 the move was complete, and the company became Birmingham Royal Ballet. Purnell also played a leading role in securing BRB’s independence from the Royal Opera House.</p> <p>In 2005 he moved from Birmingham to a small village in Norfolk, and began a career as a freelance consultant. He helped to promote the arts in the county and worked with Norfolk Dance. During this period he suffered with and recovered from from throat cancer. </p> <p>When the opportunity to join the Wallace Collection as director of public engagement arose in 2014, he moved to London. At this museum housing fine art in Manchester Square, off Oxford Street, he championed collaborations between art, music and dance and encouraged the development of outreach programmes. </p> <p>Three years later he became chief operations officer. He missed being involved with events, so in July 2020 he became director of Strawberry Hill House and Gardens, Twickenham. Strawberry Hill, Horrace Walpole’s 18th-century gothic house had been lovingly restored in the decade from 2004 and Purnell knew he had to balance preserving the building and keeping it alive. </p> <p>He enjoyed being involved in making new acquisitions and loans; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/may/07/catherine-de-medici-1561-portrait-to-return-to-london-mansion\">a portrait of Catherine de Medici,</a> whom Walpole admired, was added to the gallery, and a fishtub from Walpole’s collection – in which his cat was said to have drowned, inspiring Thomas Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.thomasgray.org/texts/poems/odfc\">Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes </a>– was also displayed.</p> <p>Purnell supported a range of exhibitions both in the house and online, including one on gothic toy theatres, and community activities in the garden.</p> <p>Born and brought up in Bristol, Derek claimed that the port city aroused his curiosity about history. He was the younger of two sons of Betty (nee Cornish), an office worker, and John Purnell, who worked for Rolls-Royce. Derek was educated at Monks Park comprehensive, where he enjoyed the benefit of inspiring teachers of English and art; he also studied ballet, taking classes with Bettie Vowles.</p>    <p>At 16 he was accepted into the Royal Ballet upper school, from where he graduated to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet in 1973. He was a versatile performer whose height was an advantage. At one performance he would mime older characters including the Duke of Courland in Giselle or the Russian Merchant in Léonide Massine’s La Boutique Fantasque, at the next he revealed his technical skills in the pas de six from Les Rendezvous, the Gypsy Girl’s Lover in The Two Pigeons, Lysander in The Dream and even a Tomato in Pas de Légumes – all ballets by Frederick Ashton. </p> <p>Purnell was also noted for dancing choreography by George Balanchine. While a leading dancer in the corps de ballet, he was chosen for the male lead, partnering Vyvyan Lorrayne, in Concerto Barocco, of which the Times critic wrote: “Derek Purnell in the slow movement supports her with a wholly admirable reticence, almost achieving the illusion that it is Bach’s music rather than his arms causing her to soar above the stage.”</p> <p>In 1974 he married Elizabeth Cunliffe, a dancer and Benesh movement notator, with whom he had a daughter, Louise. That marriage was dissolved, and in 1982 he married Aileen Morrison, a viola player who worked with many orchestras. They met when she was playing with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet orchestra. Their daughter Kirsty now teaches on several dance outreach programmes.</p> <p>Purnell retained his love of dance, serving as a governor of the Royal Ballet, and was active on several committees, including serving as vice-chair of the board of trustees of the Royal Academy of Dance. In 2024 Purnell was on the verge of taking up the position of executive director of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.</p> <p>He is survived by Aileen and his two daughters.</p> <p>• Derek James Purnell, dancer and arts administrator, born 5 April 1954; died 2 August 2025</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/giant-rock-hudson-james-dean-elizabeth-taylor-epic-family-drama",
    "description": "<p>Hudson, Dean and Elizabeth Taylor make a thrilling trio in this decades-spanning saga set on a scorching Texan ranch</p>",
    "content": "<p>“I think Rock Hudson worked best with a big background,” says film historian Steve Hayes in a biography of the Hollywood heart-throb, “in a big melodrama against a big landscape”. It doesn’t get much bigger than George Stevens’ three-and-a-half-hour epic Giant, starring the towering Hudson – who stood 6ft 5in at the height of his fame.</p> <p>Adapted from Edna Ferber’s 1952 bestseller of the same name, Giant is a film of great conscience and scale, tracing multiple decades of a southern family reckoning with social and political tailwinds on their ranch. Often described as the national movie of Texas, Giant actually begins further east in the state of Maryland where Jordan “Bick” Benedict Jr (Hudson) has journeyed to buy a horse fit for his 595,000 acres of land. There he meets and quickly marries debutante Leslie Lynnton, played by a young Elizabeth Taylor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elMP6PqGBo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/elMP6PqGBo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Without second thought, the well-mannered, equestrian flower of the east – a clear case of typecasting for Taylor, who earlier won hearts as a teenage horse-whisperer in National Velvet – leaves it all behind for a life saddled at Bick’s side on his grand cattle ranch under the flaming Texan sun.</p> <p>“Hot? It was about 120 degrees in the shade!” Taylor <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?si=7L1PbtXSjClZrgxh&amp;v=pV2HaQtqy4M&amp;feature=youtu.be\">said of the storied summer shoot</a>, which took a horrific turn when co-star Mercedes McCambridge was seriously scarred after make-up melted into her skin, burning her neck. Ironically, it’s McCambridge’s Luz, Bick Benedict’s spinster sister, that is most at home in these scorching conditions. Early in the film, Luz hosts an outdoor barbecue on a sweltering day to welcome her new sister-in-law to the community, which includes the avoidant ranch-hand Jett Rink – played by Giant’s true star James Dean. Luz’s friendly hazing sees Leslie faint before the entire town. As an easterner, her blood is “too thin” for Texas.</p> <p>Yet from the moment of her arrival, Leslie’s presence brings about an important shift in the town. Unlike her husband, she shows basic respect for Mexican workers on the ranch – her progressive instincts no doubt a reflection of the political upbringing she received as an upper-class girl in the more progressive Maryland.</p>    <p>In the many years it spans, Giant endeavours to form a political picture of the south, from early debates between the newlyweds over the status of Texas as a “stolen state” to the penultimate scene where Bick brawls with a small-business owner refusing service to a Mexican family. The great accomplishment of the story is that it is one where a man of great stature admits that he was wrong.</p> <p>The other primary thread in Giant<em> </em>is the making of another man – Jett – into an emperor. With his humble beginnings as a worker on Bick’s station, Jett comes into a great fortune when he discovers the small share of the ranch bequeathed to him by the late Luz sits above an oil well. His realisation is a moment of spectacular eruption: the well ejaculates suddenly, spraying his humble plot with glorious black grease. Jett is going to be a very wealthy man – the consequences of which become clear as the years tick by and characters age.</p> <p>Early in the casting process Stevens made the unusual decision to hire actors in their 20s as his three leads, each of which would go on to play their characters in middle age during Giant’s second act. In his transformation, Hudson, who was 28 at the time, wore a 50-pound belt as padding around his waist. He and the 23-year-old Taylor wore substantial make-up to create the illusion – and yet it was Dean, as a greying oil tycoon, that transformed most convincingly. The actor refused the same cosmetics as his co-stars, arguing that “a man of 45 shows his age in thoughts and actions, not in wrinkles”. Dean’s performance – informed by his time in Texas with real cowboys – is a masterclass in swagger, down to Jett’s speech pattern and the way he wears his big hat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/13/hooper-the-film-that-turned-the-stuntman-into-a-movie-star\">Hooper: the film that turned the stuntman into a movie star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a reliquary of three of Hollywood’s brightest stars, Giant also imagines an alternate history where Hudson, Taylor and Dean were allowed to age alongside one another. Hudson died of Aids in the mid-80s, becoming one of the first beloved public figures associated with the disease. Fans across the world were shocked to find their hero reduced to a sick old man, sadly more sick than he was old. Needless to say, James Dean never aged beyond Giant. He famously crashed his race car in California shortly after filming was complete. Taylor was the only one who survived well into the 21st century in a life defined by both richesse and heartbreak, alternatingly assailed and adored by the public eye until her death, aged 79.</p> <p>Witnessing the trio in Giant now feels like summoning ghosts. When 200 minutes have elapsed and the film is finally over, it’s almost a disappointment. Thanks to the cavalcade of great heroes that descended on Marfa, Texas, back in 1955, the night sky of the Lone Star state never looked so bright.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Giant is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US.

For some teams the high number of tackles might be a pointer to the opposition having their hands on the ball more often, but for the Pies it is a reminder that their miserly defence begins with a combativeness at the contest and being the best team in the competition for pressure all over the field. Even with a side packed with players aged on the high side of 30, the Magpies are likely to hit the ground fresh and full of running in what will be just their second game in 29 days.</p>    <p>Brisbane will have to take the long route to reach the grand final but showed last year that they can overcome that hurdle with four straight finals victories on the way to premiership glory. A return to the MCG should hold few fears for the Lions who won five in a row at the venue before a surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">lacklustre display in the qualifying final defeat</a> to Geelong. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/13/afl-semi-final-brisbane-lions-gold-coast-suns-match-report\">The reigning premiers bounced back</a> the following week – as they have so often done after a defeat this year – to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">thump bitter rivals Gold Coast</a> with a reminder of how freely they can score when their midfield and forward line click.</p> <p>The Lions will miss the injured Lachie Neale for a second week in a row but showed in the resounding win over the Suns that they have enough depth to still compete with – and even overpower – the strongest onball brigades. The reigning premiers are the best of the remaining four teams for clearances with an average of 40.4 a game, as well as for clearance differential (+4.7), and built their victory at the coalface with 51-34 clearances the last time they took on the Magpies.</p> <h2>Game shapers</h2> <p><strong>Collingwood: Steele Sidebottom – </strong>the Magpies veteran was considering retirement at times last year but again looks to have plenty left in his legs as he lines up for a 28th final and ninth preliminary final. The 34-year-old has booted 15 goals and averaged 21.4 disposals this year but it is Sidebottom’s ability to make an impact when the game is on the line that continues to set him apart. The versatile midfielder broke the game open when booting three of the Pies’ five goals as they snatched back the lead from the Crows and then powered away either side of the main break in a burst that set up their qualifying final win. Sidebottom might not have the pace that he once did but the player who booted the Magpies’ last goal in the 2023 grand final victory over the Lions has more than enough class and composure to remain a match-turning threat.</p>    <p><strong>Brisbane: Cam Rayner – </strong>the Lions dynamo has become a September specialist as he rises to the occasion in finals whether settling forward or mixing in bursts in the midfield. Rayner came under fire for the way he went to ground easily to earn a pair of contentious free kicks during the qualifying loss to Geelong but responded in the best possible way against Gold Coast with his brute force on full display. The 25-year-old shrugged off eight Suns tackles during the semi-final including stepping out of one before launching a long bomb to goal from barely in front of the centre circle. When Rayner plays well, the Lions tend to win, making the prospect of a match-up with rugged Pies defender Brayden Maynard likely to be pivotal to the result – and mouth-watering for fans.</p> <h2>Early prediction</h2> <p>Collingwood need no reminder of the threat that Brisbane pose when they are at their best but can turn to refreshed veterans to edge the reigning premiers in another finals classic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Claims on social media feeds are that synthetic hormones cause infertility and affect romantic choices. Experts say unintended pregnancies have reached ‘concerning levels’</p><ul><li><p>Read more in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral series</a></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>In the 1960s it was considered a watershed moment of liberation for women. Now, a new generation is being inundated with messages online that birth control is “evil” and “poison”. Across social media feeds, influencers are venting about hormonal contraception. Some are spreading false claims that taking synthetic hormones causes infertility, or can even be responsible for bad romantic decisions because you are “attracted to different men than you would be if you were off the pill”. Others emphasise known side-effects, such as weight gain and depression.</p> <p>Meanwhile, millions of TikToks promote the effectiveness of natural contraceptive methods, with self-described “hormone experts” claiming it is “not that hard to prevent pregnancy naturally” with fertility awareness methods “just as effective, if not more effective than the birth control pill.”</p> <p>Experts such as Dr Sarah White, the CEO of Jean Hailes for Women’s Health, say the “misinformation is extraordinary” and are seriously concerned about the potential consequences for women.</p> <h2>What is this trend?</h2> <p>Researchers at La Trobe University <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psrh.70025\">analysed 100 TikTok videos</a> from the top five hashtags related to contraception methods (#birthcontrol, #contraception, #thepill, #naturalbirthcontrol, and #cycletracking) that had collectively gained nearly 5bn views and 14.6m likes.</p> <p>They found that more than half of the video creators (53%) explicitly rejected hormonal birth control, and more than one in three (34%) expressed a distrust about healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, 38% endorsed fertility tracking, often without disclosing the limitations of this method.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/03/what-is-carnivore-diet-meat-benefits-science-does-work-why-so-many-influencers\">A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | Antiviral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White says the popularity of this kind of material is being driven by a number of factors: a wellness industry that often encourages women to not put anything unnatural in their bodies, a younger generation of women being increasingly sceptical of their doctors pushing pharmaceuticals, and a social media environment that rewards inflammatory statements and fear-based messaging. There is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/the-pill-hasnt-been-improved-in-years-no-wonder-women-are-giving-up-on-it\">conservative backlash against birth control.</a></p> <h2>Do ‘natural’ contraceptive methods work?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/contraception/fertility-awareness-based-methods-contraception-lactational\">Fertility awareness-based contraceptive methods</a> aim to identify the fertile window by tracking biomarkers for ovulation, such as basal body temperature and cervical mucus, to avoid a pregnancy. The method can be up to 99% effective when used correctly, but when it isn’t, almost one in four users will get pregnant over a year, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/natural-family-planning/\">according to the UK’s National Health Service.</a></p> <p>Prof Danielle Mazza, a practising GP and the head of Monash University’s department of general practice, says many women find it hard to determine when the fertile period of their cycle actually is. She says basal body temperature tracking is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/colossally-naive-backlash-birth-control-app\">not a good way to prevent pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>Even for women who have a very regular cycle and feel confident identifying their fertile window, the method still relies on several additional factors to work, she says. They have to be prepared to forego sex for considerable periods of time during the month, as well as spontaneity in their sex lives. They also have to have a partner who’s not coercive or violent, and they must make sure they don’t have sex when they’re inebriated or under the influence, Mazza says.</p> <h2>What about side effects of hormonal contraception?</h2> <p>Hormonal contraception is one of the most researched medications, Mazza says. “The majority of women can use these forms of medication very happily, with very few side-effects.”</p> <p>Known <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/side-effects-and-risks-of-hormonal-contraception/\">side-effects of hormonal birth control</a> include headaches, nausea, mood swings, weight gain, sore breasts and acne. However, social media can amplify individual negative experiences, with research showing young people in particular often believe that a lived experience is just as credible as advice from a trained professional, White says.</p> <p>If women are unhappy with the side-effects they are experiencing, Mazza encourages them to talk to their doctor rather than discarding contraception, because there are <a href=\"https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/individuals/contraception\">different methods of effective contraception</a> that could suit them better. “It’s very important to come back for review, because also a lot of women can attribute symptoms to the pill or other hormonal forms of contraception, whereas there might be other reasons why they’re getting those kinds of symptoms.”</p> <p>Mazza also highlights that some side-effects can be transient. For example, breast tenderness or feelings of fullness when you start the pill are common, but usually subside within a few months. She says she does not know of any research to prove claims that women are attracted to men they wouldn’t be attracted to if they were off the pill.</p> <h2>What do experts recommend?</h2> <p>Dr Caroline de Moel-Mandel, the lead author of the La Trobe University study and a GP, says women often feel they aren’t listened to in clinical settings. As a result, if they feel pressed into accepting a particular contraceptive method, they might search for an alternative or talk about it and seek validation online from women who feel the same way, “and it becomes a cycle”.</p> <p>“The platform offers women a space to talk about their side-effects, or their distrust or their frustrations that they have with the pill, or maybe even with the consultations that they had with their doctors,” Moel-Mandel says.</p> <p>“Women need to be part of that decision-making process,” with their own lived experience being validated alongside their doctor’s medical perspective, she says. Other barriers, such as appointments being too expensive, also need to be addressed.</p> <p>White also emphasises that data shows – at least in the Australian context – that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/27/australian-women-lagging-on-use-of-iuds-due-to-education-failure-experts-say\">level of knowledge around contraception is very low</a>. Many women are worried about short- and long-term side-effects of hormonal contraception. As a result, she says, there is “a concerning level of unintended pregnancy”.</p> <p>“Being able to choose when to get pregnant is really, really, really critical for a woman’s health and her economic security.” But White stresses that “you can’t make an informed choice if you’re being misled.”</p> <p>• Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral\">Antiviral</a> is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"bb8fc08d-d44b-4ccf-9d6c-c259975cf0a5\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>",

    "description": "<p>Survey of 12,000 women also revealed severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across menstrual cycle</p>",
    "content": "<p>Women with long Covid are prone to longer, heavier periods, which could put them at greater risk of iron deficiency that exacerbates common symptoms of the condition, doctors say.</p> <p>The findings emerged from a UK survey of more than 12,000 women, which also found that the severity of long Covid symptoms rose and fell across the menstrual cycle and became worse when women had their periods.</p> <p>Preliminary tests revealed hormonal changes and excessive inflammation of the womb lining in women with long Covid, but more work is needed to establish the knock-on effects. There was no evidence that long Covid harmed ovary function.</p> <p>The work points to a two-way effect, with long Covid affecting women’s periods and hormonal changes over the menstrual cycle affecting the severity of long Covid symptoms.</p> <p>“Our hope is that this will allow us to develop really specific treatments for women with long Covid who are suffering with menstrual disturbance,” said Dr Jacqueline Maybin, a reader and honorary consultant gynaecologist at the University of Edinburgh. “It may also lead to female-specific treatments for long Covid itself, which we know can be quite prevalent in women of reproductive age.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6\">estimated 400 million people</a> worldwide either have long Covid or have recovered from the condition. Nearly 2 million people in England alone self-report as living with long Covid, defined as symptoms that persist for at least four weeks after catching the virus.</p> <p>Doctors have recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/15/long-covid-has-more-than-200-symptoms-study-finds\">more than 200 long Covid symptoms</a>, but the most common include fatigue, brain fog, difficulty breathing, digestive issues, headaches and changes to smell and taste. The ailments appear to be driven by an array of problems, from residual infection and ongoing inflammation to disruption of the immune system and mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cells.</p> <p>Maybin and her colleagues analysed data from 12,187 UK women who completed an online survey between March and May 2021. More than 1,000 had long Covid, while more than 1,700 had recovered from the virus. More than 9,400 had never tested positive for Covid.</p> <p>Women with long Covid had longer, heavier periods and more bleeding between their periods than other women, the researchers found. A follow-up survey with 54 women revealed that the severity of their symptoms fluctuated over the menstrual cycle and worsened in the two days before and during their periods.</p> <p>The researchers went on to analyse blood from 10 women with long Covid. Tests revealed inflammation in the womb lining and higher-than-usual levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone. Both could be drivers of heavier periods.</p> <p>Importantly, according to the study in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62965-7\">Nature Communications</a>, the tests found no evidence that long Covid harmed the normal functioning of the ovaries.</p> <p>Many women of child-bearing age are iron-deficient, and heavy periods often contribute to the issue. This leads to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness, all of which are common in long Covid. “If you have long Covid on top of iron deficiency, it’s unsurprising that these women are really debilitated and unable to function,” Maybin said.</p> <p>Dr Viki Male, who studies reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said inflammation in the uterus was associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, so this could be the link between long Covid and prolonged or heavy periods. “Anti-inflammatory drugs are already used to treat heavy periods, so these findings suggest they might also be helpful for people who experience heavy menstrual bleeding as a symptom of long Covid,” she said.</p>",

In the traditional knockout format, only first, second and third are guaranteed a place in the next round, requiring Gout to be at or near his best to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">make sure his senior major debut lasts more than one race</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/15/a-nobody-who-became-really-good-gout-gout-takes-his-bow-on-the-world-stage\">‘A nobody who became really good’: Gout Gout takes his bow on the world stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The field is led by Bryan Levell, who last month recorded the third quickest 200m time in the rich history of Jamaican sprinting, behind only Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake. His 19.69sec into a slight headwind in Budapest elevated him into the medal conversation in Tokyo. But he has been consistent since winning Jamaica’s national title in June, including two sub 20.30sec runs in overseas meets before his breakout time in August.</p> \n<p>With his upright, robotic style, the 21-year-old Levell shot away early in that race in Hungary, and running inside Gout on Wednesday he is expected to heap pressure on the teenager from straight out of the blocks.</p> \n<p>Higher than Levell on the world rankings, Zimbabwean Makanakaishe Charamba made the 200m final in Paris last year. He may have finished last that day, but the 23-year-old has taken a step forward in 2025, and now has a personal best of 19.92sec which he has run twice this year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\" data-alt=\"Table showing the runners and best times in Gout Gout's 200m heat at the 2025 World Athletics Championships\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=eb9bcd32-06fd-4be8-b763-9617f95693a3\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Israeli sprinter Blessing Afrifah is the only other one in the heat to have run sub-20sec and will be looking at Gout as a rival for a semi-final place.

Afrifah has struggled to go as quickly since, but his season best of 20.31sec suggests he will be in contention to make it through.</p> \n<p>Although Gout needs to finish in the top three to secure a direct place in the semi-finals, a quick fourth place is likely to get him through as one of the six next fastest qualifiers. A time of 20.44sec was enough to make the semis in Budapest. The slowest Gout has run over 200m this year was a 20.30sec at the Maurie Plant meet in his first race against adults.</p> \n<p>On that chilly Melbourne night in March, Lachie Kennedy beat him to the line in front of a capacity crowd at Lakeside.

    "content": "<p>Isn’t it funny how ingredients have entirely different connotations depending on your context?</p> <p>In the Anglosphere, cottage cheese is mid-century diet food. Served with grapefruit halves, joyless and tasteless. Richard Nixon’s last White House meal: tinned pineapple slices with an ice-cream scoop of cottage cheese and a glass of milk. Yikes.</p> <p>Yet in eastern Europe, farmhouse cheeses like cottage cheese and quark are staple inclusions that have nothing to do with weight loss fads. To me, it’s stained with sour cherry jam and washed down with Babushka’s black tea “zavarka” in a saucer. It’s bulking out the filling of Mum’s khachapuri. And, if I’m lucky, it means syrniki – AKA tvorozhniki for breakfast – using up any old dairy in the fridge, but especially cottage cheese, to make our version of ricotta hotcakes.</p>    <p>Of course, context can change over time too; and even western palates are growing fond of this fresh fromage. Cottage cheese has become a feature of some of this year’s most viral recipes, from protein-packed super bowls to two-ingredient GF wraps (the other ingredient is eggs). As a result, many countries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/07/cottage-cheese-shortage-australia-tiktok-viral-recipes\">experiencing shortages</a>.</p> <p>Luckily, there are plenty of uninitiated folk who are seeing the cottage cheese shelf empty and wandering off, without giving a quick glance nearby to find its kissing cousin: quark! Say it like the sound a posh duck would make.</p> <p>While they’re both fresh cheeses, quark and cottage cheese are made quite differently. Some cottage cheese is cultured to help it set, but it’s more likely to be acidified with vinegar or lemon juice like ricotta. There can be a lot of variation between brands and styles of cottage cheese, depending on where you are in the world.</p>    <p>As this product has traditionally been relegated to the “diet” section of western supermarkets, it’s often made using skim or low-fat milk, which can affect the flavour and make the texture a little more watery. Rather than seeking out a low-fat label like it’s 1985, look for the cheese with the fewest ingredients, keeping an eye out for additions like thickeners and gums, as well as flavourings and salt content.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <p>Quark is always made with Lactobacillus cultures, like yoghurt, along with microbial rennet (as you would for other cheeses). As a result quark changes more in texture and flavour, depending on the season and the milk. I spoke with one of my favourite quark suppliers and they said: “Because we pasteurise low and slow and unhomogenised, our quark is generally smooth – but being small-batch and seasonal, it can change depending on the milk, the weather and, yes, who’s on the tools that day.”</p>    <p>You can probably guess which product is my pick, though you can pretty reliably sub one in for the other the next time you’re inspired to try a “cottage cheese hack” from the internet – including in this recipe. The only difference you might find is that low-fat cottage cheese can get a little weepy and split due to all the thickeners and gums going goopy under heat, so in those recipes, low real estate labels and/or quark are your friend.</p> <p>For this recipe, I’m taking inspiration from the sweet syrniki Mum makes for breakfast and the savoury pelmeni Dad makes for dinner (bought frozen from the shops then pumped up with caramelised onion, sour cream and dill).</p>    <p>I’ve kept the syrniki super light by treating them more like ricotta gnudi, shaping them, then letting them sit on the gluten-free flour until they form a skin. Because it’s gluten free, you don’t have to worry about overworking the gluten, which means you can really ensure that the ingredients are evenly mixed together. With a diligent fry on either side, the batter then sets while the inside stays tender. The golden onion slices (sweated down low and slow until they change colour) are enriched with sour cream for a simple sweet-savoury-tangy sauce that brings everything together.</p>    <p>Cracked caraway is the surprise hero here, taking these from a simple breakfast stack to a sophisticated dinner dumpling, with notes of Borodinsky rye. Mind you, that’s just my frame of reference. My home economist Jane Grylls visited when we were cooking these and described the eating experience as “Russian dimmies” (that’s dim sum for those outside Australia) because they’re so savoury and satisfying. If you can’t find caraway seeds, fennel seeds will give you a similar enough vibe to save a trip to the shops.</p>    <p>These can be made in advance and reheated to serve, or eaten cold for brunch al desko, so you can nix the paltry pineapple slices and blob of bland forever.</p> <h2>Savoury syrniki with caraway and caramelised onion – recipe</h2>    <p>Serves: <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>40g butter</strong>, plus extra for frying<br><strong>1 brown onion</strong>, thinly sliced into half-moons against the grain<br><strong>½ tsp caraway seeds, </strong>or fennel seeds, crushed<br><strong>¼ tsp salt flakes<br>1 egg<br>500g quark</strong> (or full-fat cottage cheese)<br><strong>100g gluten-free self-raising flour, </strong>50g for the syrniki and 50g for dusting<br><strong>300g sour cream<br>¼ bunch of dill, fronds picked, stems finely chopped<br>Freshly ground white pepper</strong></p> <p>In a wide, heavy-based pan, melt the butter and oil together, then pop in the onion (along with a pinch of sugar if you’re that way inclined) and listen for the sizzle on medium heat. Once you hear the sizzle, drop the heat to medium-low and whack a lid on, along with a timer for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Crush your caraway seeds with the salt in a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, pop the seeds and salt in the base of a large mixing bowl and use the bottom of a bottle (like wine or olive oil) for crushing.</p> <p>Mix together the crushed seeds and salt, along with the egg, quark and 50g of flour.</p> <p>On a medium sized tray sprinkle over the other 50g of flour. Use two tablespoons to blob out walnut-in-shell-sized amounts of batter into the flour, shaking it about to coat them. Leave them on the tray for five to 10 minutes to keep soaking up more starch while you wait for the onion to caramelise (this’ll help them form a crust).</p> <p>Once the onion has fried and turned golden brown with little flecks of caramelisation on the tips, pull it out into a bowl, trying to keep as much oil and butter in the pan as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/11/alice-zaslavskys-crisp-topped-tuna-nicoise-mornay-tuna-pasta-bake-recipe\">Alice Zaslavsky’s crisp-topped tuna niçoise mornay (tuna pasta bake) – recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If need be, add another knob of butter and oil as you go, and fry the batter balls for three to four minutes each side on a medium heat until browned top and bottom.</p> <p>Pull the dumplings out of the pan on to a lined tray and pop a tea towel on top to keep them warm but not schvitzy.</p> <p>To finish the sauce, wipe any gunky bits out of the pan, then pop the caramelised onions back in on a low heat, stirring through the dill stalks, most of the sour cream and a good helping of freshly ground white pepper.

It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favour and stand up for journalists’ first amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”</p> <p>The suit makes a series of verbose claims about Trump’s achievements, wealth and skill on the television show The Apprentice. It claims he secured “the greatest personal and political achievement in American history” with his election win, while accusing the NYT of trying to damage his “worldwide reputation for success”.</p> <p>It states The Apprentice was a success because of “President Trump’s sui generis charisma and unique business acumen”. It describes his father, Fred C Trump, as “a legendary businessman and a patriot”.</p> <p>“Thereafter, President Trump’s stewardship of the Trump Organization has made it and the Trump name synonymous not only with New York City real estate but also with worldwide excellence, luxury, and opulence,” it states, taking issue with the NYT’s reporting of his business dealings.</p> <p>The suit accuses the NYT, as well as other “legacy media” regarded as opponents, of engaging in election interference. It points to the paper’s decision to endorse the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the last presidential race.</p> <p>The NYT made the endorsement while other major outlets took the unusual move of refusing to endorse a candidate in the race. The Washington Post, owned by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, opted against endorsing a candidate. That decision was criticised by some as an attempt to appease Trump and led to a backlash among subscribers and Post employees.</p> <p>The case against the NYT is just the latest of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits Trump has launched against US media outlets since his return to the White House.</p> <p>Lawsuits have been brought against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million\">ABC News and the anchor George Stephanopoulos</a>, as well as Paramount over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris\">60 Minutes interview with Harris</a>. Those cases were settled for $15m and $16m respectively. The case against the Wall Street Journal is ongoing.</p> <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump denounced the NYT as “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party”.</p> <p>“I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER,” he said, though he did not provide any evidence for the claim. “Their Endorsement of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!</p> <p>“The ‘Times’ has engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation as a whole.”</p> <p>The lawsuit cites articles in the NYT based on Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success, a book by the reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner.</p> <p>“Defendants maliciously published the book and the articles knowing that these publications were filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump,” the filing states. Penguin Random House, the publisher of the book, which is also being sued as part of the action, has not yet commented on the suit.</p> <p>Articles in the NYT to be cited in the filing include one published before the November election, which was described as an “election-interfering salvo”. The suit says the articles were part of a long-term pattern of “intentional and malicious defamation”. It seeks damages of “not less than $15bn”.</p> <p>Trump’s team has previously filed a libel suit against the NYT in relation to an opinion article concerning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/trump-campaign-sues-new-york-times-for-libel-over-russia-story\">Russian interference in the 2016 US election</a>. It was dismissed on the grounds of “protected speech”.</p> <p>Trump also has sued the newspaper and his estranged niece over a 2018 story about his family’s wealth and tax arrangements, describing it as an “insidious plot” to obtain his records. A New York judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/donald-trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-mary-trump\">threw out the case</a> in 2023.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lauren Choi wanted to give plastic a second life. Her experiment turned into The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.</p> <p>But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019, during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw material.</p> <p>Choi then took a weaving class at a Baltimore, Maryland, maker space so she could make a sample fabric out of those filaments. That became the foundation for The New Norm, a textile company that today transforms a variety of post-consumer recycled plastic into stylish sweatshirts and beanies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/modernize-trade-trumps-tariffs\">At 23, she set out to modernize the spice trade. Now she’s navigating Trump’s tariffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’ve always thought long-term,” Choi said. “And that helps me look beyond the next couple years, [to the] bigger picture, where globally, [the plastic crisis] is something we need to address.”</p> <p>The company is a natural extension of Choi’s longstanding concern about the dual climate and plastics crises and a deep connection to fashion. She had been sewing since she was a child, interned at a swimwear company earlier in college, and – before teaming up with classmates – spent a summer trying to build an extruder machine in her parents’ garage. “[The New Norm] really tied my interests together,” she said.</p> <p>After graduating in 2020, Choi raised grant funding so she could dive more into product development. “That helped it go from a passion project to a real, real project,” she said.</p>    <p>Choi started working with suppliers who source plastics from recycling facilities across the country. “Recycled [materials are] still the wild west,” she said. “We received batches that were unusable or contaminated or too mixed. It was a lot of trial and error to find the right people.”</p> <p>Another challenge: Up until that point, the fabric coming out of the extruder still had a distinctly brittle, plastic feel – it didn’t feel wearable like a traditional textile. So Choi reached out to Gaston College’s Textile Technology Center, just outside Charlotte, North Carolina, for help.</p> <p>“If you’re going to produce a knit garment, it needs to be comfortable,” said Jasmine Cox, the center’s executive director. “It needs to be breathable, cozy, things that people love. It can’t feel like a plastic cup.”</p> <p>Cox’s team, along with people at the Polymers Center in North Carolina, helped Choi develop a custom formula that could be fed into extruders to produce soft textiles. “Our entire goal [was] to get her to that point where it was plug and play,” Cox said.</p> <p>It took them a couple years, and more grant funding (from Johns Hopkins, Garnier, and Reynolds Consumer Products, Hefty’s parent company, among others), to get to that point. The New Norm released its first, direct-to-consumer collection of sweaters and beanies in late 2023. Made from 5,000 upcycled party cups, the drop sold out in two months.</p> <p>Choi works with textile facilities in North Carolina and Virginia to produce The New Norm’s yarn, much of which is then shipped to Brooklyn, where a manufacturer uses 3D printers to produce sweatshirts and beanies, which retail between $45 and $85.</p> <p>“3D knitting has a lot less waste compared to traditional cut-and-sew, where many fabric scraps are wasted,” Choi said. “Instead, our pieces are knit straight out of the machine without any seams – it’s just one full garment that doesn’t need additional sewing.”</p>    <p>Even though the company now uses a variety of plastics, multicolored party cups still make up most of the raw materials in its own line. The items’ pink, blue and green pastel hues come from the cups themselves rather than added dyes. Choi said her yarn is made from continuous filaments, rather than fibers that are spun together, which means it’s less likely to shed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know\">harmful microplastics</a>.</p> <p>The New Norm is still a lean operation: Choi, who recently moved to Boston to pursue an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said at any given time there are between three and 25 people working at the company. She declined to share sales figures, but said that in the last two years production had expanded from tens of pounds per run to thousands.</p> <p>Choi said she aims to expand the business-to-business side of The New Norm, which she sees as offering the biggest opportunity for an environmental impact.</p> <p>“From the beginning, our goal has been to get to a place where we can scale production and work with really large brands who are using significant quantities of materials,” she said. The New Norm is undergoing pilots with large brands, testing everything from the strength of the yarn to how well it launders, with the goal of developing and selling the material at a much larger scale.</p> <p>This aligns with where some experts see the industry going, as a growing number of companies rethink where they source their raw materials. One <a href=\"https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/sustainable-fabrics-market-9619?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">report</a> found that the sustainable textile market was valued globally at $29.5bn in 2024, and is expected to hit $71bn by 2031. (While what constitutes “sustainable” is somewhat nebulous, most research defines it as textiles made with eco-friendly material, including recycled fibers, which minimize water, chemicals, and carbon emissions.)</p> <p>For her part, Choi hopes The New Norm can put a dent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns\">global plastics crisis</a>, which has reached disastrous levels. The world produces 200 times as much plastic today as it did in 1950, less than 10% of which is recycled. There’s an estimated 8bn tons of plastic pollution across the globe, and just three plastic chemicals cause as much as $1.5tn in annual health costs.</p> <p>Cox said Choi was early in terms of thinking about how to transform plastic into textile. And while there are other companies that turn plastic and textile waste into yarn, Cox said Choi’s focus on the party cup was unique, especially because of where it could lead. “Food containers, food packaging, that’s something that we don’t think about,” she said. “Everyone throws it out daily, and there haven’t been many solutions.”</p> <p>Some might question if we really want to be wearing clothes made out of plastic, but the reality is we already are. More than 60% of fibers produced worldwide are synthetic, the vast majority of which are derived from virgin fossil fuels, according to a 2024 report from <a href=\"https://2d73cea0.delivery.rocketcdn.me/app/uploads/2024/09/Materials-Market-Report-2024.pdf\">Textile Exchange</a>, making the fashion industry a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cox and Choi both acknowledged how much needs to be done to reduce plastic usage, but see upcycling as an important first step.</p> <p>“It would be amazing if we lived in a plastic-free world,” Choi said. “But if you look at the volume of virgin, synthetic fibers made annually, we’re talking billions of tons of material. There’s a long road to go.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The city of Birmingham lies just over 40 miles north-east of Ludlow, but to the 10,000 residents of the quiet Shropshire town, it may as well be on the moon.</p> <p>“You can’t get a bus to Birmingham today, it’s impossible. It is really just up the road, our big regional centre but there are no buses. How ridiculous is that?” said Philip Adams.</p> <p>Adams, who has lived in Ludlow for many years, remembers the bygone days of the poppy red buses of the Midland Red company toing and froing to Birmingham, until the publicly owned business was broken up in 1981 and sold off under Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation agenda.</p> <p>Today, Midland Red buses can only be found in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59827695\">transport museums</a>, and the route from Ludlow to Birmingham is most often done by car.</p> <p>Over the years since privatisation, bus companies in Shropshire have folded, risen and folded again, and the public service has collapsed.</p> <p>According to data from the thinktank Common Wealth, the county has suffered one of the biggest reductions in bus routes in the UK over the past six years, with a 60% reduction in kilometres travelled by bus.</p> <p>A survey of passenger experiences of Ludlow’s bus routes, conducted by the town’s sustainable transport group, revealed how people, particularly elderly residents, were suffering from this devastation of public transport.</p> <p>Confusing timetabling, long gaps of up to four hours between buses, and irregular service were all highlighted. “The accessibility of a regular town bus has practically been destroyed,” said one member of the public.</p> <p>According to Common Wealth’s research, the same picture is repeated across the country. Since privatisation, services have collapsed but bus and train ticket prices have risen above inflation every year since 1987.</p>    <p>More than £16bn has been paid in dividends to the owners of bus and train companies: £14.2bn since 1996 to the shareholders of the privatised train companies and £1.82bn for the shareholders of bus companies since 2007, according to Common Wealth.</p> <p>Since 2020 alone, at least £143m has been distributed to the shareholders of bus firms while the companies oversaw pre-tax losses of £53m.</p> <p>Taxpayers are shovelling money into the system to shore it up, with £2bn of additional public funding paid to bus operators in the past five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\" data-alt=\"Graphic shows bus fare rises compared with motoring costs\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Train companies are also receiving public money while handing out dividends. According to the Office of Road and Rail, the public paid £12.5bn in 2023-24 to subsidise rail companies – £4.1bn in net payments directly to operating companies and £8.3bn paid to Network Rail, which in turn further subsidises the operating companies indirectly.</p> <p>Direct and indirect subsidies to train companies enabled the operating companies and the rolling stock companies to run post-tax profits of £449m annually since the year ending March 2017.</p> <p>But much of these profits, Common Wealth says, were paid out in dividends rather than reinvested in services.</p> <p>Today getting a train from Ludlow to Birmingham is almost as difficult as spotting a bus on the route. It requires a detour 30 miles north to Shrewsbury, or 24 miles south to Hereford, to change trains for the Birmingham service.</p> <p>For passengers who use the CrossCountry trains from the south-west to Birmingham and beyond, the pain is evident. The company was ranked the worst in Britain this summer by Transport Focus, the independent watchdog for passengers, and only 41% of its services run on time.</p> <p>Ownership of the rail and bus sectors faces a shakeup by the Labour government. Train operating companies across the UK are being renationalised under the 2024 Passenger Railway Services Act, with Welsh and Scottish rail operators back in public ownership in 2021 and 2022 respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\" data-alt=\"Chart shows distance travelled by buses has reduce in 15 English local authorities\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said the rolling stock companies also needed to be returned to public ownership to ensure renationalisation led to a coherent and well-planned system.</p> <p>The bus sector is also facing an overhaul, with new legislation permitting the creation of local authority-owned bus companies once again and bringing fares, routes, timetables and connections back into public control.</p> <p>Public ownership of public transport is overwhelmingly popular. In 2024, YouGov found that 76% of the electorate backed public ownership of rail and 66% backed public ownership of bus services.</p> <p>“Passengers pay the price for privatisation through higher fares and cut-back services,” said Lawrence.</p> <p>“Public transport should be genuinely public. Money should be reinvested, not leak out the system. Vital services should be provided based on need not profit. And the fragmentation that leads to higher costs should be replaced by a coherent, public-oriented system.”</p> <p>As a member of Ludlow 21, a sustainable transport group in Shropshire, Adams agrees. “Privatisation has been a complete disaster for bus services. It just doesn’t work.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Framework deal is breakthrough in long-running dispute over app’s ownership amid security concerns in Washington</p>",
    "content": "<p>Jamieson Greer, a US trade representative, said on Monday that Washington and Beijing have struck a framework agreement on transferring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> to US-controlled ownership.</p> <p>Speaking after emerging from negotiations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">Chinese</a> officials, Scott Bessent said the deal was coming but declined to reveal the commercial terms.</p> <p>“We have a framework for a TikTok deal,” the treasury secretary told reporters after coming out of high-level talks in Madrid. “We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” Bessent added that the Chinese team had made “aggressive asks” during negotiations, but did not explain what they were.</p> <p>Li Chenggang, the top Chinese trade negotiator, confirmed later on Monday that two sides had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting trade. Li said friction between the two economic giants was normal, but warned Washington against continued “suppression” of Chinese companies.</p> <p>“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are hard won, and the US side should not, on the one hand, ask China to accommodate its concerns, whilst at the same time continue to suppress Chinese companies,” Li said in Madrid.</p> <p>The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/24/why-is-us-threatening-to-ban-tiktok-and-could-other-countries-follow-suit\">Joe Biden signed legislation</a> that gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/19/third-tiktok-ban-extension-trump\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/tik-tok-ban-trump-extension\">extended</a>.</p> <p>The US is estimated to have over <a href=\"https://analyzify.com/statsup/tiktok\">135 million active users</a> on the platform, including the White House, which launched its own official account in August, despite the fact that government devices themselves are <a href=\"https://digitalpolicyalert.org/change/4280-no-tiktok-on-government-devices-act\">still prohibited</a> from using the app under federal law.</p> <p>TikTok briefly went dark in January when the ban took effect, displaying messages that the app was unavailable under US law. Trump reversed the shutdown within hours of taking office, signing an executive order to delay enforcement for 75 days before extending the deadline again and again. Apple and Google had removed TikTok from their app stores during the brief blackout but restored access after government assurances they would face no penalties.</p> <p>Washington’s security concerns center on fears that Beijing could manipulate the massively popular platform to spy on Americans or influence public opinion. Christopher Wray, the former FBI director, <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2023/03/08/fbi-director-warns-senate-of-chinese-control-over-tiktok-data/\">warned senators</a> that China’s national security laws could compel ByteDance to hand over user data or suppress content, and the Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, abortion and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-censorship-us-data-240e11d9bb6212b0c9b1adab821e5005\">according to court documents</a>.</p> <p>Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ devices.</p> <p>The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential acquisition worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-says-failed-tiktok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-worked-on-2021-09-28/\">the strangest deal</a>” he has ever worked on.</p> <p>Soon after, Walmart and Oracle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/10/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-and-walmart-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-say-reports\">came close</a> to buying TikTok’s US arm, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.</p> <p>Oracle has remained <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">TikTok’s US cloud provider</a> since 2022 in a deal aimed at addressing security concerns.</p> <p>Bessent said final details would be settled when Trump speaks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, on Friday. Trump hinted that the deal was in the making while all sides were still at the table, posting on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115208260926006345\">Truth Social</a> that “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much want to save. They will be very happy!”</p> <p>Greer confirmed that the agreement was now awaiting approval from both leaders.</p> <p>“We’re not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Two parents who caused the death of their newborn baby after taking her to live in a tent in wintry conditions to evade social services have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon went off the grid in late 2022; their four older children had previously been taken into care due to concerns for their safety if left with the couple.</p> \n<p>A jury in their Old Bailey retrial unanimously found them guilty of manslaughter in July. In their first trial last year, the defendants had also been convicted of perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child and child cruelty.</p> \n<p>Sentencing them on Monday, Judge Lucraft KC told them: “It is clear … neither of you gave much or any thought for the care or love for your baby.”</p> \n<p>The judge said they had displayed “arrogance”, adding: “What you did towards baby Victoria can only be described as neglect; neglect of the gravest and most serious type.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jul/15/inside-the-trial-of-constance-marten-and-mark-gordon\">‘A relentless, destructive energy’: inside the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There has been no genuine expression of remorse from either of you.”</p> \n<p>While he said they had expressed sadness, they had “adopted the stance of trying to blame everyone else”.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Lucraft, the recorder of London, jailed the pair for 14 years and handed Gordon a further four years on extended licence.</p> \n<p>Speaking after the trial, DCI Joanna Yorke of the Met police, who led the homicide investigation, said: “The selfish actions of Mark Gordon and Constance Marten resulted in the death of an innocent newborn baby who would have recently had her second birthday and should have had the rest of her life ahead of her.”</p> \n<p>Jaswant Narwal, the chief crown prosecutor, said the couple had “used different antics to frustrate and delay court proceedings”, adding: “No child should have had its life cut short in this preventable way. I hope today’s sentences provide a sense of justice and comfort to all those affected by this tragic case.”</p> \n<p>During the sentencing hearing, the judge repeatedly reprimanded Marten and Gordon for their “disruptive” behaviour in the dock as their lawyers were mitigating for them. He threatened to have them removed from the court, and to continue the hearing without them if necessary, labelling their behaviour “disrespectful”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2269053e-735d-4a02-a068-d3cd7061a45f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nA7tXJaRVVg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jurors in the first trial were not told about Gordon’s violent past, which was partly revealed only in their second trial. Lucraft listed this among aggravating factors when passing sentence.</p> \n<p>Gordon and Marten spent seven weeks on the run before they were found by police in Brighton, East Sussex.</p> \n<p>Officers had launched a nationwide hunt after finding the couple’s burnt-out car on a motorway near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on 5 January 2023. In it was evidence that the baby, Victoria, had been born shortly beforehand.</p> \n<p>The couple travelled across England in taxis with the newborn; eventually ending up in the countryside near Brighton.</p> \n<p>After a search by police, Victoria’s body was found amid rubbish inside a Lidl bag in a disused shed. Her remains were too badly decomposed to establish the cause of death.</p> \n<p>The prosecution said she had died from hypothermia in the cold and damp conditions inside the flimsy tent, or was smothered. The defendants claimed their daughter’s death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep on her.</p> \n<p>In 1989, Gordon, then 14, held a woman against her will in Florida for more than four hours, and raped her while armed with a knife and hedge clippers. Within a month, he entered another property and carried out another offence involving aggravated battery.</p> \n<p>Gordon, who moved with his mother from Birmingham to the US at the age of 12, was sentenced to 40 years in jail and released after 22 years.</p> \n<p>Jurors in the retrial appeared shaken by the revelations – even though Marten had revealed Gordon’s rape conviction while giving evidence.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Gordon was convicted of assaulting two female police officers at a maternity unit in Wales, where Marten gave birth to their first child under a fake identity.</p> \n<p>Jurors were told Marten had been warned by social workers about the risk of falling asleep with a baby lying on her and that a tent was unsuitable.</p> \n<p>Both defendants gave evidence in their retrial but each cut short their testimony before they could be cross-examined by the prosecution.</p> \n<p>Marten and Gordon were told they would serve two-thirds of their 14-year custodial terms behind bars. And they were told they would then be released to serve the remaining time on licence. In Gordon’s case, the latter period included the extra four years handed down because of the danger he was deemed to pose.</p>",
