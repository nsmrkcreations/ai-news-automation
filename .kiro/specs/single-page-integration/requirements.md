# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves consolidating the NewSurgeAI news platform into a true single-page application by removing redundant separate HTML files and updating all reference links to use the existing hash-based navigation system. The current index.html already contains all necessary sections (home, categories, article, about) but there are still separate HTML files that create confusion and duplicate functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation to work seamlessly within a single page so that I have a consistent experience without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click any navigation link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate section within the single page
2. WHEN I access any URL that previously pointed to separate pages THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate section in the single page
3. WHEN I bookmark or share a URL THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct section reference using hash navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove redundant HTML files so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL have only one main HTML file (index.html)
2. WHEN separate HTML files are removed THEN all functionality SHALL be preserved in the single page
3. WHEN files are removed THEN no broken links or missing functionality SHALL exist

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all internal links to work correctly so that I can navigate the site without encountering broken links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on footer links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct sections
2. WHEN I click on navigation menu items THEN the system SHALL show the appropriate content
3. WHEN I click on breadcrumb links THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the correct sections
4. WHEN I access category links THEN the system SHALL filter content appropriately within the categories section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the article viewing functionality to work within the single page so that I can read articles without leaving the main interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on an article THEN the system SHALL display the article content in the article section
2. WHEN viewing an article THEN the system SHALL show a back navigation to return to the news list
3. WHEN I share an article URL THEN the system SHALL open the article in the single page interface
4. WHEN I navigate back from an article THEN the system SHALL return to the previous section state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI and styling to remain unchanged so that the visual experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete THEN all visual elements SHALL appear exactly as before
2. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the styling and layout SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the responsive design SHALL work correctly across all sections
4. WHEN using dark/light mode toggle THEN the theme SHALL apply consistently across all sections
