# ✉️ NewSurgeAI Contact Form - WORKING! 

Your contact form is now **fully functional**! Users can send you emails directly from your website.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # Double-click this file or run in terminal:
   start_contact_server.bat
   ```

2. **Open your website:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Test the contact form:**
   - Go to the Contact section
   - Fill out the form
   - Click "Send Message"
   - You should see a success message!

## 📧 How to Receive Real Emails

Currently, contact form submissions are logged to the console. To receive actual emails:

### Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. **Get Gmail App Password:**
   - Go to Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"

2. **Update .env file:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=nsmrkCreations@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL=nsmrkCreations@gmail.com
   ```

3. **Restart the server**

### Option 2: Use the Mailto Fallback
- If the server fails, the form automatically opens the user's email client
- The email is pre-filled with all the form data
- User just needs to click "Send" in their email app

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
# In one terminal, start the server:
python contact_server.py

# In another terminal, run the test:
python test_contact_form.py
```
