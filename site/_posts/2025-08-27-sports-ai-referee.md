The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) has announced the implementation of a revolutionary AI-powered referee assistance system, marking a significant shift in how professional sports are officiated.

## The New System

2. **Motion Tracking**: Precise player movement and ball trajectory tracking
3. **Instant Decisions**: AI-assisted calls for fouls, violations, and out-of-bounds plays
4. **Human Oversight**: Traditional referees maintain final decision authority

## Player and Coach Reactions

Initial feedback from the sports community has been mixed:

- Many players welcome the increased accuracy
- Some coaches express concerns about game flow
- Referees are adapting to the hybrid approach

## Implementation Timeline

The system will be rolled out in phases:

- Pre-season testing: September 2025
- Full implementation: 2025-26 season
- Global adoption target: 2026
