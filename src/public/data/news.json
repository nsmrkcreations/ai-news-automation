    "content": "<p>The spectators on the grandstand at Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi jumped to their feet as the horses competing in the fifth race of the Day of Champions – the last meeting of the season – came around the final corner on a recent Sunday afternoon. “Bedford! Bedford! Bedford,” some roared, punching the air as the horse, jockeyed by Michael Fundi, broke into a gallop on the home stretch, passed the leader, and stormed to victory.</p> <p>Fundi, who had started the day on top of the jockey standings, was crowned the season’s champion after the last race. At 20, he was the youngest in a decade.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Michael Fundi with Bedford after winning the 2400m Jockey Club Stakes George Drew Challenge Series. </p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: Kenya’s former president Uhuru Kenyatta presents the champion jockey plate to Fundi. Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.</p></li> </ul> <p>“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.</p> <p>Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.</p> <p>“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.</p> <p>Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses cross the finish line.</p></li> </ul> <p>Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.</p> <p>Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.</p> <p>The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers. </p> <p>Black trainers are making their mark too.</p> <p>Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Above: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p>Left: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.</p></li> </ul> <p>Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.</p> <p>He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.</p> <p>A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.</p> <p>Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.</p>    <ul> <li><p>James Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.</p></li> </ul> <p>The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.</p> <p>K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.</p> <p>Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.</p> <p>During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.</p> <p>Now the situation is improving with more local participation.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Crowds in the grandstand before a race.</p></li> </ul> <p>The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.</p> <p>At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuota<strong> </strong>acknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.</p> <p>“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.</p> <p>The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.</p> <p>Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Faces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.</p></li> </ul> <p> Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.</p> <p>“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”</p> <p>The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.</p> <p>“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Horses gallop down the final straight in a race. </p></li> </ul> <p>The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.</p> <p>Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.</p> <p>“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”</p>",

New Zealand 15-10 South Africa (Holmes, 41)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wow! What a start to the second half! </strong>Waaka rose high to win the kick-off and then it was just about speed of ball and accuracy off the breakdown. They kept the ball alive and kept chewing up metres. Ponsonby almost got there herself but was hauled down. They kept it alive, shifted it left at pace and Holmes, on the edge, had a simple run in to the corner. She dusted herself off to take the conversion but missed for the third time today. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c56bfc8f0880bae9c52e80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T13:05:36.707Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Black Ferns are out early. </strong></p> <p>The Saffas have taken their time leaving the tunnel.

Good teams punish mistakes. </p> <p>But SA have certainly made things more difficult for themselves. Make no mistake.

A. Half!</strong></p> <p>That had everything you’ve come to love about NZ v SA rugby. The Black Ferns were clinical with ball in hand when they got in the red zone and accurate at the breakdown.

Off the 15 women maul they kept it tight. They inched forward.

They spark down the line with Ngwevu makings ground. Hele picks and goes and almost finds Mpupha with a neat inside ball. It’s spilled, but backwards. Roos gathers and attempts a high kick ahead but NZ field it. So we come back for the penalty. Janse van Rensburg finds touch so they get one final shot to score before the half time whistle. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c567178f0880bae9c52e52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:45:31.949Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>37 min: </strong>A big territorial win for NZ after Dolf’s clearing kick, following a hoof from Demant, skews off her shin. NZ get the line-out inside SA’s half. They try to work a move down the line off the top but can’t stitch it together. A quick rush on defence from Somoya forced the spill. Scrum for SA. After a slick opening, this half is unravelling slightly with errors from both teams. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c5668c8f0880bae9c52e4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:42:53.216Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>35 min: </strong>The Sa scrum is clicking. Hele gets a good pick up off the base. Rather than run herself she passes for Janse van Rensburg who passes as well. The ball to Mphupha on the charge is above her head and the cantering centre can’t hold on. So we’ll get another scrum, this time for New Zealand towards their right touch inside their own half. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c565d28f084b3c85a4e1bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:39:39.326Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>32 min: </strong>SA are back on the ball inside NZ’s 22 thanks to a stiff carry from Ngwevu and a show and go from Roos following a dominant scrum.

New Zealand 10-5 South Africa (Sorensen-McGee 29)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Too easy! </strong>That’s slick from NZ. A strong shove off the scrum, they went down the right in a flash. One pass, two and then Sorensen-McGee had a simple run in after finding the edge.

NZ win a penalty off the restart and Demant hoofs it long. Malinga fields and delays. She then passes to Dolf who delays. You just don’t have the time at this level and in a flash the SA fullback is snaffled and shoved back over her own line. NZ now have the scrum five metres out almost right in front of the poles.

That gave Joseph enough time to get across and block the clearing kick. It landed in the breadbasket of Stefano who had a simple job of scoring from five metres out.

That is honestly unreal! It was a howler of a throw from Gwala as she totally missed her jumper. Olsen-Baker got hold of the loose ball and took it within a few metres of the SA line. Mikaele-Tu’u kept it alive and had a clear sight of the try but got hammered by Hele on the cover.

They worked the move off the scrum well enough, and had Woodman on the ball on the wraparound, but her final pass to Miller in the left tram was poor.

Soon after a long raking kick pins SA in their own 22 but slick hands and accurate passing means the Boks have worked their way out of trouble with a break down the right.

In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c549378f0880bae9c52d8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:40:54.635Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ebere Eze</strong> makes his full Arsenal debut, replacing Gabriel Martinelli in one of three changes from the defeat at Arsenal. <strong>Martin Odegaard</strong> comes in for Declan Rice, who is rested, and <strong>Cristhian Mosquera</strong> covers for the injured William Saliba.</p> <p>Ange Postecoglou makes only one enforced change to the last Nottingham Forest XI selected by Nuno Espirito Santo. <strong>Morato</strong> comes in for the injured Ola Aina, which probably means a switch to right-back for Neco Williams.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-3-3)</strong> Raya; Timber, Mosquera, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Merino; Madueke, Gyokeres, Eze.<br><em>Subs: Kepa, White, Lewis-Skelly, Hincapie, Rice, Nwaneri, Dowman, Martinelli, Trossard.</em></p> <p><strong>Nottm Forest (4-2-3-1)</strong> Sels; Williams, Milenkovic, Murillo, Morato; Sangare, Anderson; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood.<br><em>Subs: Victor, Luiz, Kalimuendo, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee, Bakwa, Boly, Savona.</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Darren England.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2a1838f08671965418dbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:30:02.208Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Narrative is oxygen in modern football coverage, and we’ll all be gulping plenty of the good stuff this afternoon.

Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”</p> \n  <p>He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”</p> \n  <p>The problem for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a></strong> is that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.</p> \n  <p>They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts\">winter fuel duty</a></strong> decision, the freebies row and the handling of <strong>welfare cuts</strong> – have instead unleashed more chaos.</p> \n  <p>The most recent example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">sacking of </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">Peter Mandelson</a></strong>. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.</p> \n  <p>Then, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.</p> \n  <p>With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.</p> \n  <p>Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the <strong>NHS</strong>, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.</p> \n  <p>“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions. We’re doing lots of good stuff but it barely gets noticed. It just doesn’t hit the mark.”</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">Can Keir survive?

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> \n  <p>Blake said last week’s reshuffle saw a “narrowing” of representation of different parts of the party in ministerial positions:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People just felt that it was such a large reshuffle and, you know, people who were actually delivering in their posts were moved. And it just kind of felt like there was a real narrowing in who was sat around the table, and that can’t be positive, because I think there’s a sense that the leadership don’t like to be challenged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the No 10 operation, she said it was “really embarrassing” if Starmer was not told about Lord Mandelson’s emails to <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> soon enough, amid suggestions <strong>Downing Street</strong> was aware of the messages before the prime minister defended the ex-ambassador on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>Blake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the back benches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> \n   <p>Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also said backbenchers are frustrated after a number of “own goals” for the government. Blake, the MP for <strong>Sheffield Hallam</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it is “frustrating” that the good work the government has done is “not cutting through” and added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Instead, we’ve had a number of kind of own goals, and that has meant that we’ve slipped heavily in the polls, and that we seem to be more interested in focusing on each other rather than what’s in the best interest of the country at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are some other key developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</strong>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Senior Labour MPs and the UK’s largest anti-fascist campaign group have called on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> to mount a more heartfelt defence of diversity and anti-racism.</strong> They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lucy Powell has called for a “change of culture” inside Starmer’s Downing Street to make it more inclusive and better connected to MPs</strong>, promising that as Labour’s deputy leader she would when needed deliver difficult truths to the prime minister. Speaking to the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/phillipson-and-powell-confirmed-as-final-contenders-in-labour-deputy-race\">after she secured</a> 117 MP nominations in the battle to replace Angela Rayner, Powell said a sequence of what she called “unforced errors” by the government had left many Labour MPs and members frustrated.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The bill to legalise assisted dying is a “licence to kill” that puts vulnerable people at risk, Theresa May has said</strong>, as the legislation was <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/sept-2025/assisted-dying-bill-considered-by-lords/\">debated in the House of Lords</a> for the first time. The former prime minister said she opposed the bill because she said people in England and Wales with disabilities, chronic illnesses or mental health conditions could feel under pressure to end their lives, and “because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others”.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:27:54.210Z\">at 9.27am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

But his lack of a degree didn’t stop him from assuming a defining role in the ongoing transformation of US higher education.</p> <p>Kirk pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement’s ideological agenda.</p> <p>“Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education.</p> <p>Kirk’s murder at the age of 31 followed more than a decade of on-campus activism, which was characterized by his staunch bigotry and Christian nationalism; hundreds of often incendiary “debates” – his favored medium; and the 2012 establishment of Turning Point USA, a conservative powerhouse that calls itself, with more than 900 chapters, the nation’s largest youth movement. Starting from his parents’ garage in suburban Chicago, Kirk often boasted, the movement grew one viral attack line at a time, supercharged by social media’s conflict-rewarding algorithms.</p>    <p>Kirk wore his lack of a degree as a point of “pride”, he told California governor Gavin Newsom in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XJ6rQDRKGA\">podcast interview</a> earlier this year, and as ammunition for his characterizations of American campuses as elitist and out of touch.</p> <p>“I didn’t even graduate community college,” Kirk said. “I represent most of the country. Actually, still, the majority of the country does not have a college degree and if I may, you know, bluntly critique the Democratic party, you guys have become so college-credentialed and educated that you guys snobbishly look on the muscular class of this country.”</p> <p>While Kirk had in recent years moved from campus activist to the upper echelons of Republican politics and Trump’s inner circle, on university campuses he will mostly be remembered for his role galvanizing the so-called “culture wars” with his regular diatribes against diversity initiatives, immigration and minority groups. Kirk emboldened conservative students to turn on faculty and classmates, established a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/17/turning-point-usa-professor-watchlist\">professor watchlist</a>” for faculty it accused of spreading “leftist propaganda”, and embarked on an anti-woke crusade that has since become official government policy.</p>    <p>“Turning Point was not the first group to target professors, and of course attacking higher education is not new,” said Matthew Boedy, a professor of English at the University of North Georgia who has been studying the group and its founder after being targeted on its watchlist. “What Turning Point did was take the traditional, old ways of conservatives fighting the culture war and translated it into millennial speak.”</p> <p>Katie Gaddini, a history professor at Stanford University who studies US conservatism, recalled seeing Kirk speak at an event years ago, where he boasted that if given 15 minutes with any college student, he could “de-program years’ worth of indoctrination”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: ‘prowling Blacks’ and ‘the great replacement strategy’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“His whole mission, and Turning Point’s original mission, was what he called de-programming the woke indoctrination that he thought was taking place on college campuses,” she said. “And of course, we’re seeing the contestation over what can be taught in college campuses playing out on a macro, policy-level scale right now.”</p> <h2>Beyond the campus wars</h2> <p>If Kirk’s aggressive, often rude style and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">frequent forays</a> into explicit racism and sexism ruffled feathers with more traditional conservative groups on campus, he quickly surpassed them in relevance. Boedy recalled attending an event with Kirk and Black conservative activist Candace Owens, a TPUSA veteran who resigned from the organization in 2019 after making comments in which she appeared to defend Adolf Hitler. When a group of Black students raised their fists and walked out of the event in protest, Kirk and Owens mocked them and stirred the crowd to cheer them off. “It was emblematic,” said Boedy. “They’re in it for the culture war and that does mean warring against other people.”</p> <p>Hasan Piker, a leftwing political commentator who rose to prominence about the same time as Kirk and had been scheduled to debate him in two weeks at Dartmouth College, said that while Kirk wasn’t the first to debate speakers on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, “he was able to serialize this format better than other people, especially because he had a lot of institutional backing”.</p> <p>“He was a true operative,” Piker added, noting that his relationship with Kirk had been “cordial” even as their worldview was “diametrically opposite”. Still, he cautioned against interpreting Kirk’s predilection for debates as a sincere effort to engage in an argument.</p>    <p>“It’s being presented right now with this notion that everyone was doing these debates because they wanted to arrive at the truth,” said Hasan. “The ultimate purpose of these sorts of debate culture, focused video sequences, is not to actually arrive at some kind of hidden truth through discourse or the Socratic method, but more so to just ritualistically humiliate your interlocutors.”</p> <p>Kirk’s influence soon expanded well beyond campuses, said Boedy, whose <a href=\"https://www.wjkbooks.com/bookproduct/0664269214-the-seven-mountains-mandate/\">forthcoming book</a> examines Kirk’s mobilization efforts in churches, media and beyond. “Turning Point expanded beyond merely college campus wars. Kirk used the college campus wars as a springboard to talk about the larger national culture war,” Boedy added, noting that TPUSA now has more high school chapters than it has college ones, and that the group is also involved in canvassing for conservative candidates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-young-conservatives-social-media\">Virulent debater and clickbait savant: how Charlie Kirk pushed a new generation to the right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>TPUSA “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/democratic-influencers.html\">incubated</a>” more than 350 rightwing influencers over the years, the group said last year, and more recently Kirk had also taken his activism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/hellhole-uk-stolen-elections-south-korea-charlie-kirk-took-message-abroad\">abroad</a>, promoting Turning Point chapters in the UK and Australia. In May, Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/11/oxford-union-condemns-president-elects-reported-comments-on-charlie-kirk-shooting\">debated</a> the Oxford Union’s president-elect, and earlier this month he traveled to Japan and South Korea to spread his message before new audiences.</p> <p>Kirk successfully tapped into conservative students’ feelings that they had been persecuted on campus by intolerant liberals. Now, his killing risks turbocharging those grievances. “There is now proof in the minds of a lot of young conservatives that they are persecuted for their views on college campuses,” Gaddini said.</p> <p>As some brace for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-rightwing-media-reaction\">retribution</a> from the president, others warn that the chilling effect of the violence will be devastating for universities already battered by months of conflict and division.</p> <p>“This is a terrible day,” said Kamola, the Trinity professor. “Even if we disagree, the project of teaching and learning, and pursuing knowledge, is fundamentally threatened by violence.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was billed as the biggest game in Queensland ever: reigning AFL premiers Brisbane against their state rivals from down the M1. The long-derided Gold Coast had finally arrived as a force, winning an elimination final in an ecstatic finish over Fremantle, via a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/sep/08/afl-finals-gold-coast-suns-fremantle-dockers-david-swallow-nat-fyfe\">last-gasp point to retiring club great David Swallow</a>.</p> <p>For a short time, the semi-final looked like it might live up to its billing. And then it fell apart. The Suns barely fired a shot after half-time, overpowered by a manic Lions side desperate to atone after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report\">humiliated by Geelong</a> in Melbourne last week. Brisbane now face Collingwood in a preliminary final at the MCG on Saturday. Gold Coast are done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/13/afl-2025-second-semi-final-brisbane-v-gold-coast-live\">Brisbane Lions roar into AFL preliminary final with statement win over Gold Coast Suns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Suns could hardly have started better. Ben King plucked a pack mark and kicked the first goal for a confidence boost after a poor first final. Matt Rowell tore through the next stoppage and his captain, and best mate, Noah Anderson, streamed in on the run for another. Shortly after, Rowell burst through another pack and King had his next opportunity.</p> <p>King matched up on Darcy Gardiner, a gamble on the part of Lions coach Chris Fagan as he tried to free up Harris Andrews in defence. A third mark and second goal to the Suns spearhead ensured the move was short-lived. Andrews went to King, and from there the Suns forward was barely sighted. Too often, he has no impact on a contest when he can’t get the ball himself.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe\">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>For a quarter and a half, the game went back and forth at a furious clip. Both sides were aggressive in their ball use. At half-back, Lions veteran Dayne Zorko sent low, scudding passes forward, scything through the Suns’ defence. Charlie Cameron and Cam Rayner, both of whom were poor against the Cats, roamed higher upfield, asking more questions of their opponents.</p> <p>After Andrews had taken King out of the equation, two players separated the contest. The first was Josh Dunkley, who tackled the Suns – and Rowell in particular – into submission. He laid 12 in the first half and finished with 18, a finals record. He gained a mere 62m for his side, but he cost the Suns a mile in return.</p>    <p>The other was Will Ashcroft. This was, it’s worth pointing out, just his 56th game, but last year’s Norm Smith medallist is already established as a rare finals performer. One of the few who could hold his head up in last week’s drubbing, Ashcroft split the game apart in the second quarter with his run, creativity and class.</p> <p>By the end of the first half, the Suns were losing their composure. A foolish 50m penalty a minute short of half-time ended with Zac Bailey in a full 5m of space at the fall of the ball. The margin was out to 25 points at the break. That’s nothing in today’s football, but the game already felt done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/ruthless-hawks-crush-lacklustre-crows-to-secure-preliminary-final-spot\">Ruthless Hawthorn crush lacklustre Adelaide to secure AFL preliminary final spot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were only sideshows after half-time, like the sight of Kai Lohmann rubbing his newly shorn dome for luck after losing his surfie blond locks during the week. There was also the sad sight of Swallow – the Suns’ last original recruit, and first pick in the 2010 draft – trotting around in his final game, his body broken by its relentless demands.</p> <p>Is there another player in the game who has shown such loyalty for as little team success as Swallow? I’m struggling to think of one. He’s been spare parts this year, used as the substitute in six of his nine games. But more than anyone over the journey, he’s shown the way for this club. Now they have to go on without him.</p>",

There was a lack of polish in the forward line when it came to finishing off some moves, so that’s the main area that Brisbane need to fix up.</p> <p>As for Gold Coast, this is clearly their best season after being the punching bags of the comp for so long. It’s really not surprising that they were flat, after making the longest trip in football the previous week, Brisbane to Perth, and not just that but beating Fremantle, winning their first final, and doing it in the dying seconds of the game. That’s a huge emotional experience to process.

Yes, we always said that this state was the true home of Australian rules football, and tonight is the night that proves it. On reflection, it would actually be better if these clubs were on opposite sides of the draw so they could end up in the first all-Queensland grand final, but we’ll settle for a dual-knockout final to see who goes into the prelim final against Collingwood at the MCG.</p> <p>Brisbane and Gold Coast matches have not, let’s be honest, had much riding on them for most of their history given that at least one and often both clubs have been down the wrong end of the ladder. But now the Lions are reigning premiers, and the Suns, after so many years of being belted around the league, are not only playing finals for the first time, but won their first ever knockout despite taking the lead with nine seconds to go.</p> <p>It was fun. Tonight could be even more so.

What did they mean?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Investigators who found a bolt-action rifle near the site where Charlie Kirk was shot on a Utah campus said that they also found casings scrawled with messages.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, a 22-year-old college student was reported to have confessed to his family that he had shot and killed Kirk earlier this week. Robinson was arrested after his father recognised him in photos and video footage police released of the shooter escaping the scene.</p> \n  <p>One of the casings read, <strong>“hey fascist! CATCH! (up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols),”</strong>, according to an affadavit filed on Friday in a Utah court.</p> \n  <p>The arrows were most likely a reference to the popular video game Helldivers 2 and its sequence of controller moves to unleash a powerful bomb, according to an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">analysis </a>published by the New York Times.</p> \n  <p>Much of the other casings had similar messages steeped in video game references and allusions to different internet subcultures.</p> \n  <p>One of the messages, <strong>“Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,”</strong> is often used to mock participants in online role-play communities, namely furries. Another message said, <strong>“If you read This, you are GAY Lmao,”</strong> its tone suggestive of the kind of humour found on internet messaging boards.</p> \n  <p>Another casing read, <strong>“O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!,”</strong> likely a reference to the popular Italian folk song “Bella Ciao.” Popularised as an antifascist anthem in Italy after the second world war, it resurfaced globally in recent years because of its inclusion in the hit Netflix series “Money Heist” and in video games, including the first-person shooter game Far Cry 6.</p> \n  <p>The casing messages, like Robinson’s political ideology, are difficult to parse. The NYT has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html\">reported</a> that Robinson registered to vote in Utah, but is not affiliated with a political party and had never voted in an election, according to the Washington County Clerk.</p> \n  <p>His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c5627b8f084b3c85a4e1ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:25:26.026Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> on Friday “don’t even bother dealing with” the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare\">healthcare</a> priorities.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress\">Congress</a> is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives\">House of Representatives</a> have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.</p> \n  <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.</p> \n  <p>“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”</p> \n  <p>The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump\">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> Republicans passed in July.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c55d0f8f0880bae9c52e13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:16:46.019Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>What a swell party it was. Guests feasted on half-shell oysters and champagne at Washington’s luxury Salamander Hotel. Donald Trump Jr danced to YMCA while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NujJmSMi49k\">JD Vance quipped</a>: “They don’t tell you when you run for vice-president that you get brought on stage with the Village People.”</p> \n  <p>Guests at the $15,000-a-head <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/editorial-images/news/event/turning-point-inaugural-eve-ball-held-in-washington-d-c/776267713\">Turning Point Inaugural Eve Ball</a> last January included future FBI director Kash Patel, Jeanine Pirro and the Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor. But towering above them all, literally and figuratively, was Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and key enabler of the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> \n  <p>Kirk, a 31-year-old rightwing activist, podcaster and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\">was killed on Wednesday</a> by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah. For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> \n  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-maga-influence\">Charlie Kirk and the rise of Maga in US politics: ‘He changed the ground game’</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c53fa38f0880bae9c52d44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chris-stein\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T12:00:14.501Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Charlie Kirk in his own words: \"prowling Blacks\", \"some gun deaths\" worth it for second amendment right</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a>, the far-right commentator and ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, was killed on Wednesday doing what he was known for throughout his career – making incendiary and often racist and sexist comments to large audiences.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here’s Kirk, in his own words.

It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to “go” when you are. Just say when? </p> \n  <p>I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. </p> \n  <p>This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR. I am only here to help stop it, and save thousands of Russian and Ukrainian lives (7,118 lives lost last week, alone.

Students at some schools spent hours hiding under desks, only to find out later the threat had been fabricated. On Thursday, several historically Black colleges locked down or canceled classes after receiving threats, a day after the fatal shooting of conservative activist <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> at a Utah college.</p> \n  <p>According to CNN’s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety, <strong>there have been 47 school shootings in the US so far this year, as of 10 September.</strong> Twenty-four were on college campuses, and 23 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 19 people dead and at least 77 other victims injured.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-killing-invoked-bolster-uk-largest-far-right-rally-decades\">mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</a>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe</strong>. The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A fundraising page, organised by Tucker Carlson’s nicotine pouch company ALP on the Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo, <strong>has already raised more than $3.7m for the Kirk family after ALP’s initial $1m donation. According to multiple sources, Kirk’s estimated net worth at the time of his death was $12m</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk\">Erika Kirk, widow of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk\">gave a combative speech</a> saying her late husband’s message and mission will be “stronger, bolder, louder and greater than ever”</strong> and that her “cries will echo around the world like a battle cry”. <strong>A</strong> <strong>tour of college campuses by his hard-right youth organization Turning Point USA would continue</strong>, she said, in her first public statement since her husband’s killing.

The Wall Street Journal initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump\">reported</a> on Thursday that an internal law enforcement bulletin said that ammunition recovered after the Charlie Kirk shooting was engraved with expressions of unspecified “transgender ideology”, but within an hour the New York Times, citing multiple sources, reported that these claims were likely not true. The WSJ has since posted an Editor’s Note saying that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “urged caution” around inaccurate reports of transgender engravings.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> told Fox &amp; Friends in an interview – during which he also announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">a suspect was in custody </a>– that <strong>he hoped the shooter “gets the death penalty”.</strong> He declined to call for the US to come together as a way of fixing the country’s divisions, saying “I couldn’t care less” and instead <strong>casting “vicious and horrible radicals” on the left of US politics as the sole problem</strong>.

    "description": "<p>The country’s finest male intellectuals – including some in positions of power – are weighing in on the matter </p>",
    "content": "<p>Should women in the US have the right to vote? You’d be forgiven for assuming this particular issue was sorted out quite a long time ago. But, because we live in hell, it seems the question is once again up for debate.</p> <p>Not by women, though; the fairer sex is obviously too emotional for such muscular discussion. So please sit this one out, ladies, and listen to what America’s finest male intellectuals have to say.</p> <p>First up is Braeden Sorbo, a 24-year-old conservative influencer and nepo baby (he’s the son of the Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo), who claims he is constantly harangued by women telling him how desperate they are to have their rights taken away.</p> <p>“I know more young women today who say they wish they didn’t ever get the right to vote than I’ve ever talked to in my life,” Sorbo <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/women-should-not-be-allowed-to-vote-conservative-influencer-braeden-sorbo-says/\">recently told</a> Richard Harris, host of the Truth &amp; Liberty<em> </em>YouTube show. Which rather raises the question: how many young women has Sorbo ever talked to in his life? Harris didn’t push Sorbo on the veracity of this anecdata, however. Instead he just gave a manly chuckle as Sorbo blamed all the ills of the world (abortion, feminism) on the 19th amendment.</p> <p>Per Sorbo, his female peers have also told him that “I would much rather give up my one right to vote if it meant 10,000 liberal women wouldn’t be allowed to vote, so that we could return to a better place”. (<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/many-such-cases\">Many</a> such cases!) He went on to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/kevin-sorbo-son-women-vote-b2823946.html\">say</a> that his ultimate vision is a “voting system based on Christian morals, which relates to married couples having one joint vote”.</p> <p>Perhaps you’re thinking: what does it matter what a 24-year-old jamoke on a far-right YouTube show says? I refer you to line three of paragraph one: it matters because we live in hell. In a normal world, Sorbo would be a fringe figure shouting into the ether who we could all happily ignore. But thanks in part to digital media, we don’t have that luxury any more. Sorbo has 1.9 million followers <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@braedensorbo?lang=en\">on TikTok</a>.; while some of his videos only get a few thousand views he has quite a few that top a million. </p> <p>More importantly, however, Sorbo’s views can no longer be dismissed as “fringe”. Rather, the idea that women shouldn’t vote is increasingly being co-signed and amplified by some of the most powerful people in America.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the US defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth\">Pete Hegseth</a>, shared a video on X in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/pete-hegseth-video-pastors-women-voting\">several pastors</a> say women should no longer be allowed to vote as individuals. “In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” one of the pastors in the <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1953626931234054558\">CNN clip</a> says. “I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.” While Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the video, he did retweet it with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life.”</p> <p>Slate then <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/08/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-women-voting-christian-nationa\">contacted</a> the Pentagon to give Hegseth a chance to clarify his thoughts on the matter. The reply wasn’t a straight answer; instead it just said Hegseth was a member of a church affiliated with Pastor Doug Wilson and “very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings”. Wilson is a Christian nationalist <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/women-rule/2025/08/15/christian-nationalists-target-womens-right-to-vote-00511090\">who has said</a> “women are the kind of people that people come out of” and written blogposts with titles such as “<a href=\"https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/s7-engaging-the-culture/the-lost-virtue-of-sexism.html\">The Lost Virtue of Sexism</a>”.</p> <p>Then there’s the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/19/jd-vance-trump-vp-pick-silicon-valley\">bankroll</a> JD Vance’s political career. Back in 2009, Thiel <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">published an essay </a>that argued it may have been a bit of an error to give women the right to vote. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” Thiel wrote.</p> <p>Thiel got a lot of flak for this and later <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-women-democracy_n_5747079be4b03ede4413f6f5\">clarified his statement</a>, saying: “It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away … While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.” Which is rather different from saying: “Of course women should have the right to vote, I’m mortified anyone misinterpreted my pretentious word salad.”</p> <p>Predictably, Elon Musk also has some views on this matter. While the tech billionaire (soon to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/elon-musk-trillion-dollar-pay-deal-tesla\">trillionaire</a>?) has never explicitly argued women shouldn’t vote, he has amplified tweets that undermine the idea of universal suffrage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/07/elon-musk-women-testosterone\">Last year</a>, for example, he wrote “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830390502836854925\">interesting observation</a>” on a retweet of a post by an account called Autism Capital which stated a “Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The same post argued “women and low T men” are “malleable” and can’t think freely. A year before, Musk appeared to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/elon-musk-children-voting-rights-b2369096.html\">endorse the idea</a> that “democracy is probably unworkable long term without limiting suffrage to parents”.</p> <p>The right are very good at shifting the Overton window <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/06/alt-right-politics-2016-andrew-marantz-antisocial-review\">in their favour</a> and propelling once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/anti-abortion-fetal-personhood\">fringe views</a> into the mainstream. They’re also adept at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/first-amendment-conservatives-supreme-court.html\">weaponizing</a> the law to help advance their agenda. They won’t be able to get rid of women’s voting rights overnight, of course. Just like the right to a legal abortion, they’ll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/31/congress-republicans-save-act-voting-rights\">chip away at it</a> gradually with bills that disenfranchise the “wrong” sort of people and <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/the-19th-amendment-is-under-attack-and-not-every-woman-has-an-equal-right-to-vote/\">mechanisms</a> that make voting more difficult. But we should not mistake their ultimate objective. Musk, Thiel and Hegseth are some of the most powerful people in the world: when they, along with influencers such as Sorbo, hint that they are interested in getting rid of women’s suffrage, we should take them very seriously indeed.</p> <p><strong>Texas professor fired after accusations of teaching ‘illegal’ gender identity<br></strong>Texas A&amp;M University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired\">fired a professor</a> on Tuesday after a viral video in which a student complained they were being taught illegal notions about gender identity.

    "description": "<p>As the rock band played the final stop of their sold-out reunion tour near LA, it was clear: Liam and Noel Gallagher have become icons stateside</p>",
    "content": "<p>After a crowd of nearly 90,000 finished singing Don’t Look Back in Anger, Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher had a question.</p> <p>“Are we dating?” he asked fans at the Rose Bowl, a stadium just outside Los Angeles, last Sunday night. “America, Oasis, the new hot couple, yeah?”</p> <p>If the Gallagher brothers and the United States are going steady, it comes after three decades of a turbulent, on-again, off-again relationship. But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear: Oasis has finally taken over America.</p>    <p>In the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes about <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOOr1l6j7fS/?hl=en\">newly minted Anglophiles</a> and joke <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWaoYxiazp/?hl=en\">T-shirts </a>saying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline in <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/oasis-rose-bowl-stadium-concert-tour-britannia-1236512226/\">Variety read</a>: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”</p> <p>That all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the band <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">has sold 7 million albums here</a>. But by comparison, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080058/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7511240/ask-billboard-rihannas-quirky-record-in-the-hot-100s-top-10-with\">Nirvana has sold more than 27 million</a> in the US; even Gin Blossoms <a href=\"https://www.ginblossoms.net/bio\">have sold 10 million</a>, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.</p> <p>“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam later <a href=\"https://lithub.com/shitholes-usa-noel-and-liam-gallagher-on-when-oasis-toured-america/\">said of the US</a>. It was a matter of contrast, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">New York Times</a> pointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.</p> <p>But in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience</p> <footer> <cite>an Oasis fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.</p> <p>The mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”</p>    <p>But LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, told <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/out-crystal-meth-tour-1994-1235088975/\">Rolling Stone</a>. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/oasis-reunion-melissa-lim-19730919.php\">San Francisco Chronicle in 2016</a>. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOTten1j3E0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">posted on Instagram</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/22/why-britpop-nostalgia-just-wont-go-away-robbie-williams-blur-oasis\">Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/opinion/oasis-tour-america.html\">Lizzy Goodman</a> points to the Gallagher brothers’ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-online-fights.html\">unfiltered, brash</a> personas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/arts/music/oasis-liam-noel-gallagher-reunion.html\">timeless</a>, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.</p> <p>The US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”</p> <p>Maybe we finally have.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Reaction to the shocking killing of Charlie Kirk has largely overlooked the obvious: the country is awash with guns and people prepared to use them on fellow Americans</p>",
    "content": "<p>At 12.23pm on Wednesday, as the rightwing influencer and provocateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\">Charlie Kirk</a> was addressing a large crowd at Utah Valley University, a single shot rang out. He was struck fatally by a bullet in the neck, sending thousands of screaming students scattering in all directions and propelling the country into a new and dangerous crisis.</p> <p>Exactly one minute later, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/11/evergreen-high-school-shooting-colorado-updates/\">at 12.24pm</a>, about 450 miles to the east in Colorado, a 911 call came in to first responders in the mountain town of Evergreen. A 16-year-old student had opened fire with a revolver on high school grounds, critically injuring two fellow students before turning the handgun on himself.</p> <p>The confluence of two bloody incidents just one minute apart – the first taking the life of a key figure in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, the second erupting in the same school district as the notorious 1999 Columbine massacre – underlined America’s dirty little non-secret: the ubiquitous, quotidian, nature of its gun violence.</p> <p>“Yesterday was a dark day in the United States,” the former Republican political strategist and Trump critic <a href=\"https://steveschmidt.substack.com/p/charlie-kirks-assassination-shows?utm_source=podcast-email%2Csubstack&amp;publication_id=836444&amp;post_id=173372847&amp;utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=play_card_play_button&amp;r=2318e&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Steve Schmidt</a> said on his podcast on Thursday. “It was a day of mass violence, of killing, of gun violence – in other words, in America it was a day like any other day.”</p> <p>The sense of shock that has ricocheted across the US since the Kirk shooting has been palpable. Cable news shows and social media feeds have been overflowing with intense browbeating and soul-searching about the parlous – and perilous – state of the nation.</p> <p>There have been umpteen calls to prayer, plenty of partisan name-calling, and even dark warnings about a coming <a href=\"https://x.com/Ben_J_Jeffery/status/1965936979528597886\">civil war</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/utah-residents-react-charlie-kirk-shooting\">A quiet Utah town reckons with Charlie Kirk’s shooting: ‘Nothing like this has happened here’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has been noticeable by its absence, though, is virtually any talk about the instrument that lies at the heart of America’s copious ongoing blood-letting: the gun.</p>    <p>“America is an insanely violent nation,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1965862561024454961\">Hasan Piker</a>, a progressive influencer who had been scheduled to debate with Kirk at a university in New Hampshire later this month. On his Twitch stream following the shooting, Piker lamented the lack of meaningful debate about reforming the country’s globally lax gun laws.</p> <p>“A bulletproof vest would not have saved Charlie Kirk. Security did not save Charlie Kirk. The only thing that could have potentially saved Charlie Kirk from getting shot in the neck was reasonable gun control.”</p> <p>Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of a book on the second amendment right to bear arms, Gunfight, told the Guardian that Americans had shown a stubborn resistance to gun safety reform through equally terrible shooting incidents in the past. They include horrors such as the killing of 20 elementary school children in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/newtown-shooting-gunman-kills-20-children\">Newtown, Connecticut</a>, in 2012, and the mass murder of 60 people five years later at a music festival in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives\">Las Vegas</a>.</p> <p>“People’s positions on the second amendment and gun policy have really hardened in recent years,” Winkler said. “It seems like Americans are impervious to shooting-based reforms, we’re just not seeing this. I don’t think this week’s tragedies are likely to shift the substance of the debate or the current stalemate on guns.”</p> <p>Kirk had been discussing gun violence at the moment that he was shot. Sitting on a sparkling cloudless day in the shade of a tent bearing the logo of his “American Comeback Tour”, the Turning Point USA leader was sparring by microphone with students over how many mass shooters in the past decade had been transgender.</p> <p>“Too many,” he said. (In fact, trans people have carried out a tiny fraction of mass shootings, the fact-checking group <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/09/trans-people-mass-shootings-gun-violence/\">Politifact</a> found.)</p> <p>Kirk’s own views on guns in America were reflective of the prevailing attitude across the Maga universe which is fiercely protective of the second amendment despite the evident side-effects of such devotion. Kirk being Kirk – his willingness to confront his detractors face to face was summed up in his slogan “Prove me wrong” – he articulated his passion for gun rights in brutally frank terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it’s worth it to have a cost of … some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Kirk</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a speech in Salt Lake City two years ago that has been widely resurfaced on social media in the wake of his death, Kirk argued that the benefits of having guns in many American hands outweighed the costs. Gun deaths were inevitable in such a heavily armed society, he admitted, but the prevalence of firearms allowed citizens to “defend yourself against a tyrannical government”.</p> <p>“I think it’s worth it,” he said. “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It’s rational.”</p> <p>Kirk went on to repeat the mantra that the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA) touted in the wake of the Newtown tragedy – the solution to gun violence is more guns. “If our money and our sporting events and our airplanes have armed guards, why don’t our children?”</p>    <p>Such a hardline pro-gun posture has been echoed by Trump. In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, in the early stages of his first term in the White House, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-endorsees-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-more-weapons\">Trump backed</a> raising the age of gun possession to 21, and even lent his name to comprehensive background checks which have long been a central demand of gun control advocates.</p> <p>It is not clear what made him change his mind – was it pressure from the NRA or from his own supporters? – but he quickly and quietly backed off the idea. The only change in gun policy in the second Trump administration has been in the direction of loosening regulations – his recent mega finance bill removed taxes from short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, and he has instructed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to aggressively <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/02/trump-gun-policy-executive-order-biden/\">roll back</a> measures to reduce gun violence introduced by his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Kirk assassination, Trump has signaled that he will be guided not by a desire to get to the root of the problem but by a desire for vengeance. He has <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115182892535295750\">blamed the shooting</a> on the “radical left”, disregarding recent atrocities against Democrats including the June shooting of Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-killings-melissa-hortman\">Minnesota lawmakers</a> in which one was killed.</p> <p>In a statement from the Oval Office, Trump has insinuated that he intends to crack down on leftist civil society organisations. There has so far been no talk of similarly cracking down on guns.</p> <p>“There’s just no way that Trump is going to support gun reform,” Winkler said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the bedrock causes of America’s unique struggle with gun violence goes untouched. An analysis by <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\">the Trace</a>, a news outlet reporting on the issue, estimates that there are almost 400m guns in circulation in the US – that’s more than the number of people living in the country.</p> <p>More than four in 10 Americans live in households with a gun, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/24/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">Pew Research Center</a>. Though there is a partisan political divide in ownership, with 45% of Republicans owning a gun, that still leaves one in five Democrats also holding deadly weapons.</p> <p>As the number of guns has risen, so too have gun deaths. Almost 47,000 people died by the gun in the US in 2023, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has produced official figures. That’s the third-highest year on record, after a pandemic-induced spike in the previous two years.</p>    <p>The argument frequently proffered by second amendment lobbyists that this is just the way it is can easily be squelched by comparison with other rich countries. A 2016 CDC study <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/05/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-us/#how-does-the-gun-death-rate-in-the-u-s-compare-with-other-countries\">cited by Pew</a> put the US gun death rate at 10.6 per 100,000 people – more than five times the rate in Canada (2.1 per 100,000), and almost 20 times that of Spain (0.6).</p> <p>Such alarming statistics are set against a powerful subculture in which the gun manufacturing industry and pro-gun groups and magazines actively promote the allure of the sniper. “Best civilian sniper rifles”, was the headline from <a href=\"https://gunmagwarehouse.com/blog/best-civilian-sniper-rifles/\">GunMag Warehouse</a>.</p> <p>The online site <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/guns/best-sniper-rifles/\">Outdoor Life</a> ran a feature on 16 of the “best sniper rifles”, defining the weapon broadly as the one that is “most capable of fulfilling the mission that whoever is carrying it is tasked with”. The author emphasised the huge variety of environments in which the sniper rifle has to operate, including “crowded cities”.</p> <p>First on the list was the AI AXSR which was praised for its “toughness, innovation, and accuracy”. The weapon <a href=\"https://www.milehighshooting.com/accuracy-international-axsr-338-lapua-mag-27-dark-earth/\">trades to civilians for $11,000</a> on online firearms sites.</p> <p>The gun that delivered the single shot that ended Kirk’s life has been described by US investigators as a Mauser high-powered bolt-action rifle. Though it was not a purpose-built sniper rifle it was precise enough to allow the killer to strike from a rooftop about 160 metres away from his target.</p> <p>Josh Sugarmann, executive of the Violence Policy Center which has tracked the proliferation of the sniper subculture, sees its growth as part of the increasing militarization of the gun industry and its civilian offerings. “No one notices or seems to care that there is an industry actively designing and building the weapons that enable shooters to more effectively commit assassinations and mass shootings,” he said.</p> <p>“The gun industry is designing, building and promoting rifles that are effective at much longer range with the goal of ‘one shot, one kill’.”</p>",

    "title": "When Mandelson met Maga: how Labour lord charmed Trump’s inner circle",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/13/peter-mandelson-maga-labour-lord-charmed-donald-trump-inner-circle",
    "description": "<p>Peter Mandelson was effective if controversial choice as ambassador before all went wrong ‘at worst possible time’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Peter Mandelson was in his element. Lounging on a sofa one June evening at Butterworth’s, a bistro serving as the gastronomical centre of the Maga movement in Washington DC, the recently appointed British ambassador was being honoured with a plaque that indicated he was easing his way into the conservative circles around Donald Trump.</p> <p>The appointment of Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair’s New Labour project in the 1990s, had not been without controversy. He was the first political ambassador to the United States in almost half a century and had twice resigned from Labour governments in the past over scandals (not to mention his past association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein).</p> <p>So he would have to move quickly to replace the well-sourced expertise of his predecessor and build ties with a new administration that had upended all the rules of the traditional Washington establishment.</p> <p>Mandelson managed that by leaning into the heady conservative politics surrounding the US president, working old contacts in Trump’s circles of businessmen and courting the new media right. Surrounded by conservative journalists that evening, he said that, while the two leaders’ politics may differ, both Trump and UK prime minister Keir Starmer were riding the same political winds of upheaval.</p> <p>Both had received mandates, he said that evening <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/trump-mandelson-trumpworld-plaque-vrmjrqcl2\">according to British media reports in the Times</a>, from “angry people who felt they were being unheard by mainstream politics” and were “angry about the cost of living, angry about uncontrolled immigration and angry about uncontrolled woke culture spreading across institutions”.</p> <p>It was a textbook performance for the once-dubbed “Prince of Darkness” who was testing the lines between ambassadorial deference and open flattery. In public, a favourite adjective for Trump was neutral but weighty: “consequential”. In private, he tended away from criticism of the new administration, even as the White House leaned toward Vladimir Putin and flirted with authoritarian measures at home.</p> <p>His firing now amid new details of the Epstein scandal – one that the Trump administration has sought to outrun – plays out just days before Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, when Starmer must seek to influence Trump over the war in Ukraine, continue negotiations over a US-UK trade deal, deflect concern over a potential UK recognition of Palestine, and more.</p> <p>“[Mandelson] has his own independent stature and status, and that was a good thing, but it carried risks, and now it’s gone wrong,” said Alexandra Hall Hall, a former British diplomat who resigned while serving as lead envoy for Brexit in the US in 2019. “And now it’s gone wrong on the worst possible topic at the worst possible time.”</p> <p>In Washington, the British ambassador’s Edwin Lutyens-designed residence, where Mandelson lived with his partner and “diplo-dog” Jock, hosted parties that saw an influx of the new conservative media elite in Washington. At a White House Correspondents’ Dinner co-hosted by the Daily Mail in June, new media influencers like Natalie Winters, seen as a protege of the rightwing firebrand Steve Bannon, rubbed shoulders with established journalists from across the media spectrum. It reflected the White House’s own inclusion of conservative bloggers among accredited correspondents as a counterweight to a perceived liberal bias among the media.</p> <p>At a celebration for King Charles’s birthday that month, Mandelson wryly inserted jokes about Trump as guests mingled among cigar and whiskey stations, drawing laughs as he recognised a leader “associated with grand ceremonies and golden aesthetics. So happy birthday, President Trump”.</p> <p>It is precisely what Mandelson was sent to Washington DC to do: charm the Maga faithful around Trump while bringing the political heft that would allow a UK envoy to negotiate in the name of the prime minister.</p> <p>He replaced Dame Karen Pierce, a veteran diplomat who was already a regular at Mar-a-Lago and one of the best-sourced foreign ambassadors in Trumpworld. Some, like Bannon, had rejected Mandelson as a “terrible choice” because of his past remarks about Trump and links to establishment politics in the UK.</p> <p>Yet Mandelson proved the doubters wrong, as at least one conservative outlet put it. His main success was the outlines of a US-UK trade deal, which was feted at an Oval Office meeting with Trump where Mandelson was complimented by Trump for his “beautiful accent” and given the floor in a rare show of deference to a foreign ambassador.</p> <p>The White House team around him laughed as he described Trump’s “typical 11th-hour intervention by you with your phone call demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected”. He then channelled Winston Churchill as he added: “For us it is not the end, it’s the end of the beginning.”</p> <p>His absence will be noted as Trump arrives in the United Kingdom for the controversial state visit that Mandelson’s quick-found relationship with the US president could have helped to smooth.</p> <p>After the Oval Office meeting with Trump, Mandelson left with a souvenir – a handwritten note in Trump’s distinctive marker scrawl and unmistakeable signature.</p> <p>“Peter,” it read. “Great Job!”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by Tommy Robinson to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p> \n<p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central London, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> \n<p>Other planned speakers on Saturday include Ant Middleton, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for Germany’s far-right AfD party and a far-right Polish MEP.</p> \n<p>Other Americans making the trip include Joey Mannarino, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump. </p> \n<p>However, there are doubts about whether one of the most high-profile speakers, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior Jordan Peterson, will appear.</p> \n<p>While he is listed in the lineup and has been a supporter of Robinson online, he has made no mention of the event recently. His appearance would also pose questions about his continued association with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists\">Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC)</a>, a yearly gathering in London involving businesses and conservatives that has included the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK.</p> \n<p>A pause on any new leave being booked has been imposed by police, who have had to contend with violence on the fringes of previous events involving Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.</p> \n<p>In a video to supporters on Thursday about the Kirk shooting, Robinson talked about “the bastard who has murdered him, or the organisation, the corporation or the government it is that has killed him”.</p> \n<p>A 22-year-old man, identified as Tyler Robinson by Spencer Cox, governor of Utah, was later arrested as a suspect in the fatal shooting.</p> \n<p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. A smaller gathering organised by the group Stand Up to Racism is also taking place.</p> \n<p>The Stand Up to Racism march to a rally at Whitehall will be led by a Women Against the Far Right contingent including the MPs Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.</p> \n<p>“The far right are a menace to the whole of society. Their first targets, asylum seekers and Muslims, are broadening to all migrants, black people and on to trade unionists, all religious minorities and anti-racists,” said Abbott.</p> \n<p>Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: “This is going to be big, but we are also talking about movement to the right of Reform UK and we still don’t know where it is going.”</p> \n<p>Robinson also recently said he had joined Advance UK, a party set up by former senior figures in Reform UK, including Ben Habib, which will itself be formally launched next month.</p> \n<p>Robinson has increasingly pivoted towards an outwardly Christian nationalist position, particularly after his release from his latest prison sentence. Christian nationalists will be among the crowd, but a large section are expected to be drawn from the ranks of those who have taken part in the recent wave of protests outside asylum-seeker accommodation.</p> \n<p>As with other Robinson events, the core of support is also expected to come from a network of football fan and hooligan firms that are also involved in the English Defence League (EDL).</p> \n<p>Lowles posed the question: “What does this rally signify politically? One scenario is that people will coalesce around Tommy Robinson and Advance UK, but it will require him to step up.”</p> \n<p>“A lot of what he does is about himself and he’s been engaged in a huge amount of merchandising for this event, as well as constant appeals for money towards a goal of about £300,000. What will he do with it? Advance UK need him more than he needs them, but equally this could become part of his fight with Farage.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police has been engaged in discussions with Robinson before the event. The force does not give permission for protests but requires advance notice of a procession to allow for appropriate planning.</p> \n<p>A Met spokesperson said: “Saturday will be a busy day in London and officers will be on duty in significant numbers to keep people safe.”</p> \n<p>The force said Muslim Londoners should not change their plans in light of the rally.</p> \n<p>Commander Clair Haynes, who is in charge of the public order policing operation in London this weekend, said: “We recognise that there are particular concerns for many in London’s Muslim communities ahead of the ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protest given the record of anti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents of offensive chanting by a minority at previous marches.</p> \n<p>“There have been some suggestions that Muslim Londoners should change their behaviour this Saturday, including not coming into town. That is not our advice.</p> \n<p>“Everyone should be able to feel safe travelling into and around London.”</p> \n<p>As well as Robinson’s rally, which is styled as a “free speech festival” and will take place at the southern end of Whitehall after a march from Waterloo, the counter-protest by Stand Up to Racism will take place at the northern end of Whitehall, after a march from Russell Square.</p> \n<p>“There are a number of other events taking place on the same day, including multiple football fixtures, which will all form part of the policing operation,” the Met spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>As he reflected on his epic individual contribution to a thrilling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">historic win for England</a> against South Africa on Friday, Phil Salt spoke about being inspired to ever greater heights by the people around him. “The mentality that we’ve had from when I started playing for England to now, we’re always trying to push things forward,” he said. “Always trying to take, you know, the next step in the game.”</p> <p>But over the past few years most of the steps taken by the white-ball side have been backwards. It is the Test team under Ben Stokes that have produced the thrills, while in shorter formats there has been a succession of spills. Jos Buttler, by general acclamation England’s greatest short-format player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/28/jos-buttler-steps-down-as-captain-of-englands-white-ball-cricket-team\">stood down as captain</a> in February after three years that started with victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup but came to be characterised by failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/records-tumble-as-phil-salts-stunning-ton-leads-england-to-t20-rout-of-south-africa-match-report\">Records tumble as Phil Salt’s stunning ton leads England to T20 rout of South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buttler, however, is now adding fresh gloss to his reputation and in the past week has looked in brilliant touch in scoring a 32-ball 62 in England’s one-day international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/england-south-africa-third-one-day-international-match-report\">romp against South Africa</a> in Southampton, being the only English batter to flourish in the abbreviated five-over thrashfest that launched the T20 series in Cardiff, and again at Old Trafford on Friday night, where he and Salt joyfully and emphatically reclaimed the opening berths.</p> <p>With Salt on paternity leave and Buttler at No 3, Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett opened during the T20 series against West Indies in June. But, with a breathless summer behind them and a hectic winter ahead, both were rested for these games and in their absence Salt and Buttler have reunited to make the idea of picking anyone else appear absurd.</p> <p>That Buttler dominates the list of England’s most-successful T20 opening partnerships is no surprise, but the fact he and Salt have been so productive as a pairing perhaps is. In 17 innings they have scored 967 runs, one short of the total Buttler and Jason Roy accumulated in 31, at an average of 60.43.</p> <p>Of all opening pairings with at least 15 outings over the past decade, none comes close to matching them, the only other couple averaging above 47 being Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz on 53.86. No other representatives of Test-playing nations get within sniffing distance of their run rate of 10.52.</p> <p>“We bounce off each other well,” Salt said. “We’ve got pretty set roles – it’s my job to get us off to as good a start as possible and give Jos the opportunity to take a couple of balls, because when he does he goes on and gets a match-winning score a lot of the time. We don’t often need to communicate. When he needs to get me on [strike], it just happens. And when I need to get him on. There’s no ego or anything like that, we just do it, and that’s a massive part of having a good opening partnership.”</p>    <p>Salt produced England’s highest T20 score with an unbeaten 141 on Friday, his fourth century in the format (Buttler has one, in more than three times as many innings). But there are many ways the former captain has assisted Salt’s success. The way they work together at the crease is the most obvious, but Buttler was also the inspiration and the challenge that pushed Salt to focus in particular on attacking the first over, something he now does better than any batter in the world.</p> <p>“In order to knock a man out of possession, you need to do something they can’t do,” Salt said. “I thought: ‘Right, if I can be the most dangerous in the first six, 10, 15 balls of the game, that’s quite a unique tool.’ I’m someone who’s always looking at ways to get better. The goal is to be right up there. I want to be the best in the world at this.”</p> <p>Perhaps England can rationally nurse that same goal, with another World Cup to be played in India and Sri Lanka in February. But first comes Sunday’s series decider at Trent Bridge and the challenge of proving that Friday was more than a glorious anomaly.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Artificial intelligence is changing how students learn and the world they’ll graduate into. Experts reveal how applicants can get ahead</p>",
    "content": "<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”</p> <p>Altman, whose company developed and released ChatGPT in November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.</p> <p>Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.</p> <p>For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in&nbsp;many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.</p> <p>“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”</p> <p>His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”</p> <p>Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.</p> <p>He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.</p> <p>“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”</p> <p>There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”</p> <p>Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.</p> <p>“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”</p> <p>For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.</p> <p>He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.” </p> <p>Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.</p> <p>Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”</p> <p>Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”</p> <p>In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.</p> <p>“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Just seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and features the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.</p> \n<p>Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/brighton-owner-tony-bloom-nets-another-winner-with-santorini-star-at-doncaster-horse-racing\">Brighton owner Tony Bloom nets another winner with Santorini Star at Doncaster</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.</p> \n<p>All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.</p> \n<p>He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip. Scandinavia and Carmers will offer strong opposition, but <strong>Lambourn (3.40)</strong> has been edging ever close to the top of the betting in recent days and still looks fairly priced at about 5-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76eabbec-cd0a-4d04-9a3e-338198e48c4b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster </b>1.15 Treble Tee 2.50 Gewan 2.25 Apollo One (nap) 3.00 Shadow Of Light 3.40 Lambourn 4.15 Mr Wonka 4.50 Fantasy Believer</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield </b>1.25 One Million Dreams 1.58 Beccadelli 2.33 Rogue Dynasty 3.13 Kingsclere 3.55 Summertime Blues 4.30 Parish Councillor 5.00 Clearpoint</p>\n    <p><b>Chester </b>1.35 Wild Dahlia 2.05 Military Academy 2.40 Ndaawi (nb) 3.23 Hanney Girl 4.00 Glistening Nights 4.35 Giant 5.05 Heathen 5.35 Sir Edward Lear</p>\n    <p><b>Bath </b>3.28 Somebodycomegether 4.05 Cloudbuster 4.40 Under Curfew 5.10 Goodwood Mogul 5.40 Tamzan 6.13 Baynoona 6.45 Blue Point Express 7.15 Mrs Meader</p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh </b>4.10 Martin’s Brig 4.45 Welbury 5.18 Straight Ahead 5.50 Penn Avenue 6.22 Maghlaak 6.52 Red Mirage 7.22 Sixcor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.15</strong> Easier ground could be what <strong>Treble Tee</strong> needs to return to winning form after excellent efforts in defeat on his last two starts.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 1.50</strong> <strong>Gewan </strong>showed a good attitude to maintain his unbeaten record at York last month and is narrowly preferred to Oxagon, a wide-margin winner last time out.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.05</strong> There is little to choose between Hamish, the warm favourite, and <strong>Military Academy</strong> on their form at Goodwood in June, so a 3lb swing in favour of John &amp; Thady Gosden’s gelding makes him a logical pick at the likely odds.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 2.25</strong> <strong>Apollo One </strong>has been operating below his best so far this season but he was an unlucky loser of this race 12 months ago, behind a subsequent Group One winner in American Affair, and is 1lb lower in the ratings this time around.</p> \n<p><strong>Chester 2.40</strong> Gordon Elliott’s <strong>Ndaawi </strong>trailed home in last place in the Cesarewitch on his latest start on the Flat but two big runs in ultra-competitive handicap hurdles since that setback suggest that he remains well handicapped on the level.</p> \n<p><strong>Doncaster 3.00</strong> A slight ease in grade could see <strong>Shadow Of Light, </strong>last year’s Dewhurst winner, gain a confidence-boosting win.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7857ae84-4e63-4c8f-aa77-f7c4847110de\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster</b> 1.20 Stormy Monday 1.55 Obito 2.30 Indian Springs 3.00 Royal Velvet 3.35 Beaming Light 4.10 Queen Of Mougins (nb) 4.40 Hiya Maite 5.18 Arnhem&nbsp;<br><b>Bath</b> 2.00 Spinning Dancer 2.35 Karakula Dancer 3.08 Bohemian Breeze 3.43 Asinara 4.18 Supreme Diamond 4.50 Call Time 5.28 Albus Anne&nbsp;<br><b>Musselburgh</b> 2.15 Farandaway 2.50 Parisian Scholar 3.25 Rory The Cat 4.00 Drumcondra (nap) 4.33 I’m Next 5.08 This Years Love 5.43 Sanditon</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sweet William is punters’ darling again</h2> \n<p>There are horses that win with a minimum of fuss, and others, like Sweet William, that have a style that is all their own, and John &amp; Thady Gosden’s stayer kept it interesting throughout in the Doncaster Cup on Friday, as he overcame a slow start and some early coaxing from Rab Havlin in his saddle to win the Group Two contest for the second year running.</p> \n<p>Sweet William has often appeared to have his own ideas about the racing game during a 20-race career, with slow starts and mid-race flat spots frequently forcing Havlin to get busy at an early stage.</p> \n<p>When he eventually goes through the gears, however, he is a very difficult horse to keep out of the frame, and while his latest win was his first since the same race 12 months ago, his fourth-place finish in this year’s Ascot Gold Cup was the only time he has been outside the first three. His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.</p> \n<p>Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.</p> \n<p>Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”</p> \n<p>There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn. “Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”</p> \n<p>An impressive display of raw, frontrunning speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.</p> \n<p>“She’s a natural frontrunner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A corporate intelligence company part-owned and formerly run by the prime minister’s business adviser has been paid more than £1m by Thames Water as the utilities firm tries to avoid renationalisation, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Hakluyt, which was run by Varun Chandra until his appointment as Keir Starmer’s business adviser last July, has worked with Thames since 2023, providing political and strategic advice.</p> <p>That commercial relationship between Thames and Hakluyt has continued since Chandra joined No 10. He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.</p> <p>That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/08/varun-chandra-starmer-adviser-proving-vital-link-for-labour-in-us-trade-talks\">still owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluyt</a> and is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.</p> <p>In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.</p> <p>Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.</p> <p>The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.</p> <p>It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.</p>    <p>It was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.</p> <p>Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.</p> <p>Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.</p> <p>The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/rachel-reeves-thames-water-creditors\">wrote to creditors of the company in July</a> to say a “market-based solution” was her preference.</p> <p>Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.</p> <p>Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.</p> <p>That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.</p> <p>A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/07/bidders-demand-thames-water-granted-immunity-over-environmental-crimes\">leniency from fines and penalties</a>. They have also proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/creditors-set-out-20bn-plan-to-save-thames-water\">delivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five years</a> than had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.</p>    <p>Chandra is one of Starmer’s most influential advisers, and has spearheaded its attempts to ingratiate Labour with business and attract foreign capital to the UK.</p> <p>He accompanied Reeves on her visit to the World Economic Forum in January, and was in the Oval Office when Starmer met Donald Trump in February.</p> <p>Chandra has also been central to Labour’s more muscular attempts to burnish its business credentials. It is understood he was behind the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/chair-of-competition-watchdog-steps-down-after-labour-intervention\">oust the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, Marcus Bokkerink</a>, amid concerns the watchdog was holding back growth.</p> <p>The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in South Shields, Chandra helped Tony Blair set up his first advisory firm, before becoming Hakluyt’s managing partner in 2019. As of May he held Hakluyt shares worth about £7m<strong>.</strong> The company, which was founded in 1995, was named after the Elizabethan writer, priest and diplomat Richard Hakluyt.</p> <p>Hakluyt has reportedly said it plans to buy back Chandra’s shares over time and that he no longer has any voting rights or decision-making roles within the company.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the company said: “Hakluyt is a global strategic advisory firm providing insight and advice to commercial clients on a range of issues. We are not a lobbying organisation and do not lobby governments on behalf of clients.”</p> <p>A Thames spokesperson said: “We remain focused on a market-led solution which we believe is in the best interest of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy.”</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson said: “The Cabinet Office has a thorough process on declarations of interest for special advisers to ensure any conflicts of interest are properly managed and mitigated, including through recusals where appropriate.”</p>",

In fact, it is a scientific simulation – and for the first time a British pilot is among those training for the mission.</p> <p>Laura Marie, who was born in the UK and is now a pilot for a regional airline in the US, beat about 8,000 applicants to become one of six research volunteers who are preparing to spend 378 days inside the 158-sq-metre (1,700 sq ft) Mars Dune Alpha habitat at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p> <p>“It’s such a huge opportunity,” Marie told the Guardian. “And then to come this far and be in the final crew selection and heading down to training very, very soon is extremely exciting.”</p> <p>While the four “primary” crew members – Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery and James Spicer – are expecting to enter the simulation on 19 October, Marie – who has a BA in philosophy and an MSc in aeronautics – is one of two “alternate” participants, ready to step in should any of the others drop out.</p> <p>Marie said: “I am going down there with the same kind of mindset that everyone is going down there, of it being the 378 days.”</p> <p>The second of three Chapea (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/chapea/\">Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog</a>) missions, the experience is designed to help inform crewed missions to the red planet itself. The idea is the simulations will enable the collection of data relating to the physical health, psychology and performance of humans undertaking such an endeavour, with Nasa saying it could also aid assessment of its space food system.</p> <p>As in the first mission, the new crew will be growing crops, carrying out robotic operations and conducting simulated Mars walks, as well as testing technology designed for use on Mars, among other activities.</p> <p>“With science, you can’t just do something once,” said Marie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">Life on Mars ‘absolutely exhilarating’: Nasa scientist’s year in a simulation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marie, who grew up in Devon and immigrated to the US in 2016, said she was inspired to apply after hearing about the first mission as it was in progress.</p> <p>“I always had an interest professionally in working with Nasa in some kind of capacity,” she said. “So everything kind of aligned. I saw that opportunity and I jumped for it.”</p> <p>However while the first mission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/nasa-scientist-mars-dune-alpha\">ended in the summer of 2024</a>, Marie has not spoken to the crew involved, noting it is better for the data if team members are not influenced by the experiences of others.</p> <p>While training is set to start next week at the Johnson Space Center, Marie said she and the other team members had already spent time together as part of the rigorous and lengthy selection process.</p> <p>“I’m not worried about any of the crew dynamics. I would happily lock myself in a box with all of them,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/12/nasa-texas-humans-prepare-mars\">Inside the 3D-printed box in Texas where humans will prepare for Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the mission could still bring challenges. “I’m a big nature girl. I spend a lot of time outside,” Marie said, adding the lack of sensations such as wind in her hair or the smell of grass could be difficult.</p> <p>Another significant challenge will be the communication delays that are designed to mimic the lag astronauts would experience on Mars when contacting Earth.</p> <p>“There’s no live chat with mission control,” said Marie, noting that even on the international space station, astronauts can be in real-time contact with Earth.</p> <p>But there will also be downtime, with Marie revealing she will be packing a Rubik’s Cube. “I’m not just going to learn how to do it. I want to beat a record,” she said.</p> <p>While the new mission is only a simulation of the Martian landscape, Marie said she would jump at an opportunity to head to the red planet itself. Indeed Nasa is developing technologies to enable crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.</p> <p>“One hundred per cent I would take that seat on that ride if it were ever offered to me,” Marie said. “I think the whole multi-planetary species, it’s where we’re heading. And anything I can do to be a part of it – if it’s this [Chapea programme], if it’s something else – I’m just happy to be involved.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Marina Ramazashvili says son, Giorgi Bachiashvili, was the victim of a ‘vendetta’ by billionaire politician</p>",
    "content": "<p>The mother of a jailed former aide to Bidzina Ivanishvili has accused the de facto leader of Georgia of treating her son as his “personal prisoner” as she appealed to the west for help.</p> <p>Marina Ramazashvili, a renowned ophthalmologist in Georgia, said Giorgi Bachiashvili, who has allegedly been beaten in his prison cell, was the victim of a “vendetta” waged by the billionaire politician.</p> <p>The Georgian government, led by Ivanishvili, has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/mamuka-mdinaradze-to-be-georgia-security-chief-as-report-warns-of-descent-into-authoritarianism\">slipping into autocracy</a>, with the courts and the prosecution service increasingly under political control.</p> <p>“Maybe he is evil,” Ramazashvili, 65, said of Ivanishvili. “He has no humanity, he has no empathy. My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.</p> <p>Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.</p> <p>At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.</p> <p>Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/giorgi-bachiashvili-interview-georgia-bidzina-ivanishvili\">claimed in an interview with the Guardian</a> from his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.</p> <p>Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.</p> <p>Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.</p> <p>He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.</p> <p>He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.</p> <p>The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.</p> <p>A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.</p> <p>“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”</p> <p>Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.</p> <p>Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.</p> <p>Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.</p> <p>She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”</p> <p>Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.</p> <p>Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.</p> <p>“I have nothing inside,” she said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The wife of Florida surgeon general Dr Joseph Ladapo, a leading vaccine skeptic, believes that angels have spoken to her and that “dark forces” are targeting her family with chemtrails, and has claimed her husband won’t work with anyone she hasn’t vetted.</p> <p>In published works and interviews reviewed by the Guardian, Brianna Ladapo – who edited her husband’s USA Today op-ed from March 2020 against Covid-19 shutdowns and appears alongside him at conferences – claims to have regularly received visions that come true and believes her life has been saved “multiple times” by angels.</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo, a longtime vaccine skeptic who was handpicked by Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, has faced accusations by public health advocates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/florida-surgeon-general-covid-vaccine-misinformation-joseph-ladapo\">peddling “scientific nonsense”</a>. Ladapo has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/florida-joe-ladapo-investigated-covid-report-00084075\">defended</a> his stances on vaccines and Covid guidance, stating in 2023 in response to allegations he falsified a Covid report: “Between my scientific experience and training, and the fact that I am only comfortable saying the truth and speaking the truth, I felt completely fine with that announcement.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/12/chemtrails-rfk-jr-truth-behind-conspiracy-theory\">Chemtrails: why is RFK Jr battling a debunked conspiracy theory?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/florida-vaccine-mandate\">ended</a> vaccine mandates for children in Florida against preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis, comparing mandates to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/florida-vaccine-mandate\">slavery</a>” and claimed the move would receive the blessing “of God”. Florida is the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1870\">first state</a> in the US to do so.</p> <p>The Guardian made several attempts to reach Brianna Ladapo and Joseph Ladapo by email. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Florida department of health and DeSantis also did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>In a Substack <a href=\"https://briannaladapo.substack.com/p/freedom-our-forgotten-birthright\">post</a> on 5 September, Brianna Ladapo defended her husband’s decision to end vaccine mandates and claimed there are “dubious origins, nonexistent safety profiles, and dirty money trails surrounding vaccines”.</p> <p>She wrote in the post: “You believe in vaccines because you’ve been told to by a corrupt medical establishment that has a vested interest in keeping you subservient and stupid.”</p> <p>In a July 2025 <a href=\"https://new.clouthub.com/wpstream_vod/truth-be-told-with-brianna-ladapo/\">podcast</a>, Brianna Ladapo stated: “I often think if I hadn’t had to learn to trust my own gut and learn how to think and stand on my own two feet at such a young age, when Covid had come through, apparently swept away everyone’s brains, I might have been swept away right along with it if I didn’t already know how to listen to that truth that I believe is inside every single one of us.”</p> <p>She added in the podcast that “even to the lead-up, I was having visions, I was having dreams”, about the pandemic, before it began in early 2020. “Immediately, ridiculous inconsistencies started to show themselves.”</p> <p>She also appeared in an <a href=\"https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd-2024/bird-flu--polio-vaccine-nonsense--exclusive-interview-brianna-ladapo/\">interview</a> with the prominent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/health/cdc-kennedy-vaccine-disinformation.html\">anti-vaccine group</a> Children’s Health Defense in January 2025, in which she said: “If we all listen to our intuition, we listen to that voice, we would not fall for propaganda. Like, what’s happened with Covid. People did truly insane things to keep from catching a virus that over, well over 99% of people survived without intervention, right? That’s textbook insanity.”</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo has <a href=\"https://www.briannaladapo.com/events\">appeared</a> with his wife on stage at conferences on health and parenting.</p> <p>In Dr Ladapo’s 2022 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Fear-Blueprint-Mindful-Leadership/dp/1510774718?asin=1510774718&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1\">Transcend Fear</a>, he wrote that his wife has “a history of extraordinary experiences that were hard to explain with natural laws”. In March 2020, he wrote an op-ed for USA Today against shutdowns in response to Covid-19, the first of several he wrote about the virus, and noted that it was edited by his wife.</p> <p>Joseph Ladapo wrote in Transcend Fear that when he was recruited for the job of Florida surgeon general by DeSantis, his wife claimed it was the message she was waiting for.</p> <p>In Brianna Ladapo’s 2023 memoir, she <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Darkness-Spiritual-Memoir-Guide/dp/1510777849/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/144-3976682-3640302?pd_rd_w=Akdd8&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_r=XYZ73YX77CX1PQ6JDCH7&amp;pd_rd_wg=xp7jc&amp;pd_rd_r=c80b87c1-1823-489a-ac31-eb9b82d637cf&amp;pd_rd_i=1510777849&amp;psc=1\">claimed</a> “as long as I can remember, I have received communications from beings beyond this realm. Even as a young child, angels regularly spoke to me.”</p> <p>She added that “since I was born, I have also received constant communications in the form of visions” and that “eventually, every single one of them came to pass”.</p> <p>In the book, Brianna Ladapo claims she went on a “<a href=\"https://canvasrebel.com/meet-brianna-ladapo/\">pilgrimage</a>” trip to Egypt in graduate school during which she saw the rest of a “recurring vision” from a past life.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">video podcast on Rumble</a> earlier this year, she reiterated these claims about her “gifts”.</p> <p>“I was born a very sensitive child, the kind of kid who would see angels and talk to beings that no one else could necessarily perceive,” she said, claiming her family “perceived what was happening to me as satanic and demonic and evil”.</p> <p>“I saw a lot of angels, but my angels would talk to me and they saved my life multiple times,” she claimed.</p> <p>Brianna Ladapo also claimed their children together “have all been having experiences like this since they were born” and have “innate divine intelligence”.</p> <p>She claimed one of her children as a baby had “a gift” that was temporarily shared with her.</p> <p>“I started to hear conversations that sounded like they were right next to me. There were no people anywhere near us. And they were clearly from different eras, sometimes different countries, different languages and dialects,” Ladapo said.</p> <p>She said initially in their relationship, her husband was skeptical, but came to believe in her “gifts”.</p> <p>“After a number of years, he came to deeply trust my gift and now he won’t work with anybody I haven’t vetted,” she said. The couple did not respond to requests for comment about Brianna Ladapo’s vetting.</p> <p>Later in the podcast, Ladapo claimed she floated an inch above the ground during a session with a former Navy Seal and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christopherleemaher/?hl=en\">self-proclaimed traditional healing guru</a>, whom she said her husband had also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6929057317183203\">seen</a> and had similar experiences with. The healer declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.</p> <p>Ladapo is also a proponent of the chemtrails <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory-explained-cec\">conspiracy theory</a> about planes mass-dumping chemicals. She claims in the podcast interview that she and her children got sick because of chemtrails, and she used a patch that has been characterized as<a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/pseudoscience-technology/patchy-science-lifewaves-mysterious-patches\"> pseudoscience</a> by medical experts.</p> <p>“As we try to chase down where this is coming from, who is funding the companies who are flying the planes, who are piloting these planes, where are they taking off? We don’t even know where they are, because none of this is on the books.” Ladapo said about chemtrails.</p> <p>She added in the <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v6sctet-florida-surgeon-general-dr.-joseph-ladapos-wife-on-the-spiritual-and-supern.html\">podcast interview</a> about a photo of a Florida sky outside of her home: “This is how the chemtrails have been looking outside our window for the past few weeks. They are, I hate to say it, but that looks like a pentagram and they’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks.”</p> <p>She characterized the perceived chemtrailers as “dark forces” out to get her and her husband.</p> <p>“They’ve been trying to stop us for years,” she claimed. “We are operating at a level of light that puts us essentially out of the grasp of those with a very low vibration, very evil intention.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife",
    "description": "<p>The social side of university is good for your mental health and friendship circle, so consider where you’d be happiest to hang out</p>",
    "content": "<p>Choosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing.</p> <p>“Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the university <a href=\"https://yorksu.org/activities/view/album-society\">album society</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”.</p> <p>“Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs.</p> <p>But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan.</p> <p>“A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.”</p> <p>Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities.</p> <p>The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink.</p> <p>So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequently<a href=\"https://www.studentcrowd.com/page/best-universities-for-students-union\"> ranked best in the UK</a>, while the city’s DIY music scene<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/23/not-all-grassroots-venues-are-struggling-sheffields-leadmill-may-be-closing-but-the-citys-diy-hubs-are-thriving\"> continues to thrive</a>. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds.</p> <p>For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as&nbsp;possible. “You only get the university experience&nbsp;once.”</p>",

It was a moment – six Premier League games into his tenure – when people wondered whether his team might be the real thing. In September of last year, after another derby against Arsenal, this one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the manager came out with his famous comment about how he always won silverware in his second season. And here we are again. Postecoglou versus Arsenal in the early weeks of a season; the plot-lines crackling.</p> \n  <p>It is a little sleepy around the stadium at the moment; too early in the day, perhaps, for any Ange-baiting from the Arsenal support. That will change. It is rare that a visiting manager transcends a game here but that is the unmistakable vibe around Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest debut. He has succeeded a very popular guy in Nuno Espirito Santo at a club where a major power battle has just played out, Edu (the ex-Arsenal sporting director) getting the vote of confidence from Evangelos Marinakis rather than Nuno. Postecoglou’s preferred approach is the polar opposite to that of his predecessor. And he must get it to click immediately. Good thing Ange has never taken the easy path.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c544f78f086519d32714f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T10:26:00.709Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news: Arsenal v Nottingham Forest</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Eberechi Eze starts for the Gunners,</strong> as does Cristhian Mosquera with William Saliba out.

By all accounts he left coaches to do the coaching, as he well should, so we probably won’t really start seeing the impact of his successors until January or even next summer.

The defending champions have won all three of their fixtures so far but required late goals against Bournemouth and Newcastle after twice conceding two-goal leads, which pointed to defensive frailties.</p> \n  <p>Against Burnley on Sunday he will again need those resources up front - now bolstered by British-record signing Alexander Isak - against a team they will find hard to break down. Liverpool have scored eight goals, the most in the top flight, without creating that many clear-cut chances and Slot was asked how he hoped to improve that.</p> \n  <p>“To implement as best as possible the way we want to play,” he said.”But in the end the final third, it is also the form of your wingers mainly because of their playing style you end up more on the sides. The better they are, the bigger threat they are, the more chances we will generate and then nine out of 10 times it is about scoring.</p> \n  <p>“If you can score an early goal that normally helps you in a game like that. There are a lot of factors going into a game like this but as always we are hoping that our attackers make the difference and that is what they have to do every single game.”<br>But while Slot wants them to score the goals he also wants his attackers to improve their work-rate and defensive capabilities.</p> \n  <p>“If we lose the ball if we are really good in our counter-pressing that can create chances as well,” he added. “That is for me the biggest lesson of our game against Arsenal: in the first half we weren’t front-footed enough in terms of our pressing. In the second half we were and as a result we deserved to score in the second half.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c527628f084b3c85a4e024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:15:33.522Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Talking of Fitba, this piece, from the consistently excellent Nutmeg, is terrific*</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/smartphones-eroding-experience-watching-football-phones-escapism-games-impatiece\">Are smartphones eroding the experience of watching football?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><em>* Opinion, not fact</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c526928f084b3c85a4e021\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:11:47.681Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>As well as the big game at Easter Road, Rangers host high-flying Hearts at Ibrox with Russell Martin still looking for his first league win. </p> \n  <p>Rangers have drawn all four Premiership games under Martin, including a forgettable derby a fortnight ago.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/31/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report\">Martin and Rodgers feel heat as Rangers and Celtic fans boo drab stalemate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c4289b8f0880bae9c524f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T08:00:07.094Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arsenal v Nottm Forest x Big Ange (12.30pm)</strong></p> \n  <p>Will Unwin looks at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f8elrGU3AdU\">Nottingham Forest’s surprise decision</a> to sack Nuno Espírito Santo and replace him with Ange Postecoglou.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78b2d1ec-a634-45bc-a0b9-378ce95a2ca3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yz3PD1i880A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-68c523b68f084b3c85a4e012\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-13T07:58:33.988Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scottish Premiership</strong></p> \n  <p>“Oh matchday live, how could you?” <s>thunders</s> says Simon McMahon. “You forgot about about Dundee United’s trip to Easter Road to face Hibs at 5.45pm, so please, allow me.

    "description": "<p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. And the denim discourse is insufferable</p>",
    "content": "<p>If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you are wearing clothes. Or my byline photo made you spontaneously strip down to nothing but a pair of crusty underwear and a smile. I don’t judge, and I also don’t blame you. That photo is from a decade ago.</p> <p>Assuming you’re in clothes, then you had to decide what to wear. It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only. Like a kid’s birthday or a hangover.</p> <p>You know what you won’t find in my closet?</p> <p>Jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\">Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel Connolly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I hate jeans. Not even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK8s3iqL99c\">poorly conceived Sydney Sweeney commercial</a> could convince me I needed to buy jeans. If I had to choose between wearing denim and one of those <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GUN-GONE-GOONS-BARREL.png\">barrels cartoon hobos wear</a>, I’d choose the barrel. Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks. I panned for gold once, on a school field trip to <a href=\"https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485\">Sutter’s Fort</a> in fifth grade. I was not asked to go pro.</p> <p>Jeans make some people look like Bruce Springsteen – macho, blue collar and soulful. Jeans make me look like my dad – balding, with bad posture and a curious mustard stain on my crotch. Suits make me look grown up. Jeans make me look ground down. They make me look washed, cooked, chopped and all the other things my kid yells at me when I try to bend over to pick up one of his toys and I screech in pain.</p> <p>You can wear jeans if you want. I won’t stop you, but please, cease and desist with the denim discourse. A <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/bring-skinny-jeans-back\">recent GQ article</a> from July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/sperry-boat-shoes-hooked-me\">Another GQ article from this year</a>, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, or <a href=\"https://bamfstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wowspolo-main.jpg\">Jordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime</a>.</p> <p>I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)\">The Crow</a>. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.</p> <p>No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.</p> <p>I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.</p> <p>Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.</p> <p>The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/10/pradas-125bn-versace-takeover-a-new-era-for-italian-luxury\">controlled by billionaire conglomerates</a> that care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion is <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/shein-designated-biggest-fashion-polluter-bb25de66/\">contributing to global pollution</a> at an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.</p> <p>Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist</p></li> </ul>",

    "content": "<p>Sainsbury’s has recalled two varieties of its own-brand hummus over fears they may contain a deadly strain of E coli, advising customers who have bought the products not to eat them.</p> <p>The affected items are 315g containers of JS Classic Houmous, with a use-by date of 13 September, and 200g tubs of JS Lemon &amp; Coriander Houmous with a use-by date of 14 September.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency said the affected batches could contain shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), and that the items had been recalled as a precaution.</p> <p>Point of sale notices will be displayed in all stores selling the products until 3 October, explaining to customers why they have been recalled and what to do if they have already bought them.</p> <p>Sainsbury’s apologised to customers for any inconvenience and advised them not to eat the affected products.</p> <p>The products covered by the recall can be returned to Sainsbury’s branches for a full refund.</p> <p>Symptoms of an E coli (Stec) infection include diarrhoea, with bleeding in half of cases, fever and abdominal pain. The illness is usually self-limiting. Most cases lasting up to two weeks.</p> <p>A small proportion of patients, mainly children, could develop life-threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure. A similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may also develop in a small proportion of adults.</p> <p>Stec bacteria are most prevalent in cattle in the UK, but have also been found in the faeces of deer, rabbits, horses, pigs and wild birds.</p> <p>Government guidance says the strain is particularly infectious because very few bacteria are needed to cause illness, allowing the disease to spread easily within families and other settings such as hospitals and schools.</p> <p>People can become ill through eating contaminated food, contact with infected animals or people who have the illness, and drinking water from inadequately treated sources.</p> <p>The UK Health Security Agency said there were 2,544 cases of Stec infection in England in 2024, a 26% rise compared with the year before.</p> <p>Several supermarkets were forced to ditch products in June last year when the sandwich makers Greencore and Samworth Brothers recalled their items during another outbreak of E coli.</p> <p>The two producers had to recall 60 products found to contain a variety of salad leaf linked to a Stec outbreak.</p>",

    "description": "<p>PM understood not to have seen messages from former ambassador to sex offender when speaking in Commons</p>",
    "content": "<p>Keir Starmer defended Peter Mandelson in the House of Commons two days after details of the damning emails between the former ambassador to the US and Jeffrey Epstein were passed to Downing Street, according to reports.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">The prime minister sacked Mandelson</a> on Thursday after emails were published revealing that he had told Epstein “your friends stay with you and love you” while the disgraced financier was facing jail for sex offences.</p> <p>The Foreign Office received a media enquiry outlining details of the messages on Tuesday, which was passed to No 10, PA Media and the Times reported.</p> <p>The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Oliver Robbins, allegedly asked Mandelson about the veracity of the emails but did not receive a response until Wednesday afternoon, a government source told PA.</p> <p>The prime minister is understood not to have been aware of the contents of the emails until Wednesday evening. By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer and Labour MPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”. <br><br>The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.</p> <p>“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> <p>“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”</p> <p>She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said. </p> <p>The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.</p> <p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”</p> <p>He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.</p> <p>The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.</p> <p>It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.</p> <p>His friendship with Epstein was known before his appointment, however, and he is reported to have told the Times that he admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with the convicted sex offsender for many years.</p> <p>Downing Street said on Friday that Starmer has “confidence in his top team” when asked whether questions had been raised over the judgment of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was reported to have lobbied for Mandelson’s appointment.</p> <p>The backbencher Clive Lewis publicly questioned Starmer’s leadership, telling the BBC the prime minister does not seem “up to the job”.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, another MP from the party’s backbenches, said “toxic” resentment was festering among the party’s MPs and rank and file members.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, one of two candidates to take Angela Rayner’s place as Labour’s deputy leader, called for a change of culture.</p> <p>“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” she said.</p> <p>Downing Street has been contacted for comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Labour donor Lord Alli evicted a family of five from one of his rental properties before increasing the rent by nearly £1,000 a month.</p> <p>The family, who have school-age children, had lived in the five-bedroom north London townhouse for four years, paying £4,800 a month.</p> <p>Days after they were handed a section 21 “no fault” eviction notice in June, the property was re-listed for £6,000 a month, amounting to a 25% increase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/can-keir-survive-inside-the-plot-to-bring-down-the-prime-minister\">Can Keir survive? Inside the plot to bring down the prime minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood that the existing tenants offered to pay this increase in full, but this offer was refused. The home was then re-let to new tenants for £5,700 per month, a 19% increase.</p> <p>The government is planning to abolish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jan/14/tenants-landlords-discuss-renters-reform-bill\">no-fault evictions</a> under the renters’ rights bill and, in many situations, ban landlords from relisting their properties at higher rents for at least six months after evicting a tenant.</p> <p>Waheed Alli, who is worth an estimated £200m, has donated over £500,000 to Labour since 2020 and is one of the party’s largest donors. He spent weeks in the spotlight last year due to the tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, including spectacles and clothes donations to Starmer’s wife, Victoria. Starmer has also made temporary use of a £18m penthouse that belonged to Alli.</p> <p>No-fault evictions are one of the leading causes of homelessness, according to the charity Shelter, because they give landlords the power to evict tenants with just two months’ notice, without giving any reason for the eviction.</p> <p>The father of the family who was evicted from Alli’s house told the i newspaper they pleaded with the property’s management agent to allow them to meet the increased asking price and stay in the property: “We have children who were settled in local schools … so we wanted to avoid the disruption if we could.</p> <p>“We asked if there was any chance that we could even just stay an extra month so the kids wouldn’t be disrupted in September, and we could get through exams, but it was a no.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/12/labour-deputy-contender-lucy-powell-calls-for-culture-change-at-no-10\">Labour deputy contender Lucy Powell calls for culture change at No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking on Alli’s position as a Labour peer and major donor, the father added: “The hypocrisy just feels like too much … I voted Labour and I’m just incredibly disappointed.”</p> <p>Before Labour came to power, the government promised to “immediately abolish no fault eviction”, but has yet to name an implementation date for the renters’ rights bill. Recent Ministry of Justice data revealed that 11,400 households in England were forcibly removed from their homes by bailiffs as a result of these evictions between July 2024 and June 2025.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alli refused to explain the reasons the family were evicted. She said: “Lord Alli is not a commercial landlord and he doesn’t manage – and has never managed – this property. This is his former home where he no longer lives and where one tenant was replaced with another for less money than the former tenant offered and at an amount lower than the market price. Clearly, this was not about money.”</p> <p>The news comes a month after Rushanara Ali resigned as the government’s homelessness minister after it emerged she had evicted four tenants from a property she owns, then re-let it weeks later for £700 more a month.</p>",

It still contains an ornate fireplace that the poet gifted to the then owners.</p> <p>In November last year, DePree said, Rochdale council “suddenly locked the gates to the hall without any warning whatsoever”, with the local authority saying the American had not upheld his part of the deal.</p> <p>“It was a big shock and really devastating,” he said, “because so many of our volunteers from the community have been putting in five years rescuing the gardens that were completely in rack and ruin, and they turned them around into award-winning gardens.”</p> <p>DePree said he had “no confidence” in the council to secure the future of the building, and wanted to be allowed to carry on with the restoration project he had been spearheading for the best part of a decade.</p> <p>The actor said it was “really upsetting” to be told he had not made enough progress on the project, adding: “It’s been years and years of my life.”</p> <p>“I sold my house to help enable everything moving forward, and I left everything behind,” he said. “At this point, it’s been over 10 years that I’ve been involved, and I moved to England in 2017.</p> <p>“I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of my own personal money to make this happen.</p> <p>“I’m completely invested in it, and also I believe in the community,” he added. “I know how much hard work that we put in that at this point, this building has to be saved.”</p> <p>DePree said he has spent almost 11 months “trying to work with Rochdale council to find a resolution”, but now felt he had been “left with no choice but to sue Rochdale council in the high court” in order “to force them to honour our agreement”.</p>    <p>DePree’s lawyer, Nick Wells, said: “We have reviewed many years of documents and emails and eventually obtained some previously unseen evidence through freedom of information and subject access requests, many of which Rochdale borough council tried to block.” </p> <p>Wells said “the evidence points to the council having changed its position since entering into the option agreement in 2017”.</p> <p>“We are therefore asking the high court to intervene and hold Rochdale council to the decisions that they made in 2017,” he added, “rather than the decisions they have purported to have made in 2024.”</p> <p>In a previous life, Michigan-born DePree was an actor, film-maker, and writer, who once won a deal with Warner Bros to produce and star in his own television show.</p> <p>He grew up listening to stories of the family’s ancestral home in England, but believed them to be fairytales, until he began researching his family tree online, and discovered his Manchester roots.</p> <p>“I’ve given up my life for this building,” he said. “I came over to visit it first in 2013, just to see it. My grandfather was also named Hopwood, so he told me stories about it.</p> <p>“I felt that if I didn’t do something that it would fall into being lost forever,” he added. “So I gave up my life. I moved over from the US to the UK. I completely trusted the council at the time; I thought we were working in partnership together.”</p>    <p>Rochdale council said it does not comment on continuing legal proceedings, but pointed to previous statements it had made about the hall.</p> <p>A spokesperson said in November: “In 2017, the council entered into an options agreement with Hopwood DePree which gave him the option to buy the building for a nominal fee if he could produce a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall, alongside a detailed planning permission.</p> <p>“Although this agreement has been renewed a number of times since 2017, a viable business case and funding strategy has not been forthcoming, and so the council’s cabinet has made the decision to not renew the options agreement.”</p> <p>“The council sees Hopwood Hall as a very important part of Middleton’s heritage,” the spokesperson said, adding that alongside other public bodies such as Historic England, it had invested almost £1.7m into the building over the past seven years.</p> <p>The council said it had “commissioned independent financial consultants to assess the business model proposed by Hopwood Productions and they concluded that these proposals would be loss-making and unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding”.</p> <p>“As Hopwood Depree has not been able to produce a viable proposal, despite having had seven years to do so,” the council said that in order to protect public money invested in the building it had “a responsibility to explore alternative options”.</p> <p>“The council remains committed to the long-term future of the hall,” the spokesperson added, “and is keen to see it restored, so it can be brought into a viable future use.”</p>",

It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p> <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\" data-alt=\"Inflation chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p> <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p> <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p> <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p> <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p> <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p> <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p> <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p> <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p> <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p> <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\" data-alt=\"jobs chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p> <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty\">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p> <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p> <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas, new report says, amid low awareness of disease</p>",
    "content": "<p>In February, Luna donated blood at her high school in Miami, with the goal of helping save others.</p> <p>“She was very proud to come home and say, ‘I gave blood today,’” her mother, Valerie, said. (The Guardian is not using the mother or daughter’s full names to protect their privacy.)</p> <p>It turned out, she was not able to save someone else’s life but potentially prevented herself from having serious health issues.</p> <p>A couple months later, she received a letter from the blood donation company informing her that she could not give blood. She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.</p> <p>Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.</p> <p>“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,’ … you’re like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.</p> <p>Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.</p> <p>Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.</p> <p>They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.</p> <p>“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”</p> <p>Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p> <p>It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.</p> <p>Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.</p> <p>About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.</p> <p>It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(10)01160-1/fulltext\">Gastroenterology journal</a>.</p> <p>More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs’ natural environment”, Beatty said.</p> <p>People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC’s <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article\">Emerging Infectious Diseases</a> journal.</p> <p>But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2953998/\">2010 survey</a> conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.</p> <p>“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that’s something that doesn’t exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.</p> <p>But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)</p> <p>Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.</p> <p>“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.</p> <p>After Valerie received the letter about Luna’s infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.</p> <p>That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.</p> <p>Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.</p> <p>Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.</p> <p>The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.</p> <p>The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.</p> <p>While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it’s less likely, Beatty said.</p> <p>“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”</p>",

For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting\">Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> <p>Kirk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile\">grew up in an affluent suburb</a> of Chicago, the son of an architect whose firm designed the Trump Tower in New York. Rejected by the military academy at West Point, Kirk was 18 when he launched the grassroots organisation Turning Point USA in 2012, later admitting that he had “no money, no connections and no idea what I was doing”.</p> <p>Kirk’s rhetorical gift for provocative statements, inflaming cultural tensions and “owning the libs” galvanised conservative students during the Barack Obama years. He held mass rallies that drew tens of thousands of young voters each year to hear conservative leaders speaking on glitzy stages backed by ear-splitting anthems and bright pyrotechnics.</p> <p>He was the right man at the right time to pour rocket fuel on Trump’s Maga movement. In the summer of 2016 he secured a meeting at Trump Tower and gave Don Jr advice on how his father could woo young voters. Don Jr was so impressed that he instantly hired Kirk as his personal campaign assistant – or “bag boy”, as Kirk put it – as the pair took fundraising trips across the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kylespencerjournalist.com/\">Kyle Spencer</a>, a journalist and author of Raising Them Right: The Untold Story About America’s Ultraconservative Youth Movement and Its Plot for Power, said: “Don Jr didn’t think much of it until he started hanging out with Charlie and seeing how incredibly driven and ambitious he was, how skilled he was at building alliances with people of all different ages and how comfortable he was, even at a very early age, with people who had a tremendous amount of money and power. He was charming to those people but not intimidated and that was a winning combination.”</p> <p>A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/trump-kirk.html\">the New York Times reported</a>, Kirk was a guest at Don Jr’s birthday party at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump held a private conversation with him for 40 minutes.</p> <p>Spencer, who interviewed Kirk many times, continued: “Trump took a liking to him and that was very genuine. As much as Trump can have a relationship with someone and a fondness for them, he always had a real fondness for Charlie, and part of it was because he and Charlie are very similar.</p> <p>“Charlie had a kind of charismatic infectiousness and ability to draw certain people in a very similar way that Trump had. Charlie also had a real understanding of being at the forefront of media communication methods and that you always had to be a little bit ahead of the curve. Trump understood that too, which is why both of them were so comfortable building followings and communicating online and creating, in Charlie’s case, a lot of online assets.”</p>    <p>Vance said Kirk first made contact with him through a direct message on Twitter (now X) after the future vice-president appeared on Fox News in 2017. They became fast friends. Kirk was one of the first people Vance called when he thought of running for the Senate in early 2021, Vance said. Kirk introduced him to people who eventually ran his campaign – and to Don Jr.</p> <p>Vance, whom Kirk had championed as a potential running mate for Trump, <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1965985360606888182\">tweeted this week</a>: “Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind. Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/black-students-colleges-racist-threats\">Black students and colleges across US targeted with racist threats day after Charlie Kirk killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By his own estimate, Kirk visited the White House more than a hundred times during Trump’s first term. In 2020, he published the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAGA-Doctrine-Only-Ideas-Future/dp/1094116238\">The Maga Doctrine</a>, a bestselling book that argued in favour of Christian nationalism and the “America First” agenda.</p> <p>He pushed conspiracy theories popular among white nationalists, including the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/cpac-republicans-democrats-america-trump-biden\"> false claim that the 2020 election was rigged</a> in favour of Joe Biden. His Turning Point Action group sponsored buses to take supporters to Washington ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on 6 January 2021, though Kirk himself did not attend. Two people connected to Turning Point Action, including its chief operating officer, served as fake electors in Arizona as part of Trump’s plot to steal the election.</p> <p>Kirk stuck by Trump during the wilderness years, in which the former president battled four criminal cases, and helped plot his improbable comeback. Turning Point Action was instrumental in driving youth support in last year’s election and was credited by Trump’s campaign for helping deliver the battleground state of Arizona.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/24/steve-bannon-war-room-republican\">Steve Bannon</a>, a godfather of the Maga movement, said by phone from Utah: “People underappreciated this: he changed the ground game. This ballot-chasing initiative was absolutely fundamental to winning in 2024. It will be fundamental going forward. What he did with young people is extraordinary.”</p> <p>Then Kirk played an outsized role in the presidential transition, advising Trump on his staff picks. Bannon, whose War Room podcast was followed by <a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/playlists/show/the-charlie-kirk-show/\">The Charlie Kirk Show</a> each day on the Real America’s Voice platform, said: “In the transition, Charlie basically moved to Mar-a-Lago. He was a central part of the transition.</p> <p>“He was, with Sergio Gor [director of the White House presidential personnel office], doing all the vetting and in a ton of meetings. He was so busy he skipped the show a bunch; I bet you Charlie only did a third of the shows during the Mar-a-Lago transition period. That’s how involved he was in the transition. The president liked having him around and he delivered.”</p> <p>Kirk supported the controversial nomination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/pete-hegseth-what-we-know\">Pete Hegseth</a>, a former Fox News host, as defence secretary. He also made the case for Turning Point USA allies to get government jobs. Bannon believes that Kirk’s “imprint” is felt in the defence, health, homeland security and other government departments.</p> <p>“Folks he didn’t know, he would do vettings. If he had a candidate or somebody he wanted to push, maybe not for a top level job but for second or third tier where the action is, people would go to Charlie. He had very active role and that continued. He spent a lot of time in Washington in the first couple months of the administration.”</p> <p>In January, Kirk travelled to Greenland with Don Jr to promote Trump’s declared ambition to acquire the Arctic territory. More recently he returned to Phoenix, Arizona, to work on Turning Point and prepare for next year’s midterm elections, Bannon added.</p> <p>“If Charlie had wanted a senior position in the government, it was there for the taking. He could have asked for virtually anything – maybe not a cabinet-level position but in a super-important position, either in the White House staff or in any of the department – and Charlie would have gotten what he wanted.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images\">How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kirk remained in ideological lockstep with Trump and his inner circle, often echoing, amplifying and seeking to normalise their brazen displays of sexism, racism and Islamophobia. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wl3UwsNZ544?si=Y9yn_XXjc4bmQek7\" title=\"\">questioned the qualifications</a> of Black airline pilots, just as Trump had done during an attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p> <p>Jared Holt, a researcher at <a href=\"https://openmeasures.io/\" title=\"\">Open Measures</a>, a company that monitors influence operations online, said: “Kirk was a reliable propagandist who worked to sanitize the most alarming aspects of Trump’s movement. He relentlessly attacked Trump’s critics and demonized his scapegoats – immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities, to name a few.”</p> <p>There have been moments during Trump’s second term when Kirk was reportedly uncomfortable with the president’s decision to bomb Iran and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-response-epstein-files\">refusal to release files</a> on the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. But he was careful to avoid direct criticism of the man who was both political mentor and soulmate.</p> <p>After Kirk’s death this week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” The president ordered flags flown at half-mast and announced he would posthumously award Kirk the Medal of Freedom. Vance escorted Kirk’s body home to Phoenix on Air Force Two.</p> <p>His place in Maga mythology is assured, as his political legacy. <a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There are Turning Point people in the Trump administration and they are directly there because of Kirk’s influence. Charlie Kirk was talking about building a sustainable Maga movement. They’re playing for tomorrow. A lot of people are playing for today.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Watchdog says there are also allegations of discriminatory and misogynistic comments, centring on Charing Cross police station </p>",
    "content": "<p>Nine Scotland Yard officers have been suspended after an investigation was launched into claims of excessive use of force and the making of discriminatory and misogynistic comments.</p> \n<p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the allegations centre on Charing Cross police station in central London, the source of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/met-officers-joked-raping-women-police-watchdog-racist\">previous scandal</a> for the Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>The new investigation concerns 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the station. They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.</p> \n<p>The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”</p> \n<p>The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.</p> \n<p>The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.</p> \n<p>An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.</p> \n<p>The Met’s handling of the scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/met-officer-was-promoted-despite-misconduct-over-sexist-and-racist-messages\">with one officer being promoted</a>, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/commissioner-vows-to-clean-up-met-as-force-faces-biggest-crisis-since-1970s\">transform the culture</a> of Britain’s biggest police force.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/stephen-lawrence-mother-doreen-plea-witnesses-review\">Stephen Lawrence’s mother makes plea for witnesses as review begins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.</p> \n<p>The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.</p> \n<p>“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”</p> \n<p>The Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said: “The behaviour as reported is disgraceful and nine officers were suspended within 24 hours of the allegations being assessed and another two officers have been removed from frontline duties.</p> \n<p>“We are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by professional standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings. The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”</p> \n<p>Twist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”</p> \n<p>The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.</p> \n<p>“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facility</a> in Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.</p> \n<p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”</p> \n<p>The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/22/astrazeneca-invest-us-trump-tariff-threats\">would invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030</a>, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.</p> \n<p>The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.</p> \n<p>The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country into <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapped a £1bn London research centre</a> as well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.</p> \n<p>Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.</p> \n<p>A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">other big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investing</a> in the UK.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> \n<p>Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/britain-terrible-place-sell-medicines-drug-firm-executive-sanofi\">told the Guardian</a> Britain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.</p> \n<p>Sanofi said: “Any substantial inward investment into the UK is currently on pause until we see tangible progress towards making the life sciences environment internationally competitive.”</p> \n<p>Also this week, Eli Lilly, a US drugmaker, said its planned London gateway lab, an incubator space for new drugs that brings together researchers, part of a £279m investment, was on hold.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceutical industry has long argued that the UK needs to spend more on new medicines, bringing the NHS’s outlay on medications more in line with other countries.</p> \n<p>A row between the sector and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, intensified after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">long-running NHS pricing negotiations broke down without an agreement </a>in late August. Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.</p> \n<p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>The Guardian joins the Swedish coastguard to patrol an area that has become a hybrid warfare battleground </p>",
    "content": "<p>In front of a bank of screens on the boat’s bridge, the Swedish<strong> </strong>coastguard Jan Erik Antonsson shows on a live map on a laptop how many vessels of Russia’s “shadow fleet” there are in the area. “These green symbols are the shadow fleet,” he says. More than a dozen green triangles representing shadow fleet vessels pop up around the coastline of southern Sweden alone. </p> \n<p>Every day hundreds of shadow fleet ships – unregulated ageing tankers from around the world in varying states of repair carrying oil from Russia to states including China and India – are moving through a relatively narrow passage in the Baltic.</p> \n<p>What was previously hoped would effectively become “Nato lake” after Finland and Sweden joined Nato, has instead become a battleground for hybrid warfare and the shadow fleet, which move under various identities and change flags to circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Some shadow ships are understood to be accompanied by Russian military vessels, others have planes following their route from above to make sure they get to their intended destination.</p> \n<p>The Guardian was given rare access to the coastguard’s operations, accompanying KBV 003 from the port of Karlskrona on an eight-hour patrol of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.</p> \n<p>“Sea traffic in the Baltic has increased somewhat copiously with the whole shadow fleet, but also with Nato ships, defence ships and the coastguard,” says the vessel’s captain, Joakim Håkansson. “So we try to get far out and show that we’re here.” </p> \n<p>In the Bornholm strait, where shipping traffic is divided like a motorway, shadow fleet vessels pass less than 10 nautical miles off the coast of Sweden. In our vicinity<strong> </strong>off the rocky Blekinge archipelago<strong>,</strong> there are two.</p> \n<p>Later the coastguard follows one, an oil tanker currently flagged in Malta that according to online maritime records has in the last two years also<strong> </strong>been flagged in the Marshall Islands under a different name. As long as vessels are in a country’s economic zone as opposed to its smaller territorial sea – at most 12 nautical miles offshore – the grounds for intervention are extremely limited, but as of July, the coastguard is allowed to contact the vessel to request information about the ship and its insurance. A crew member on the oil tanker says over the radio its last port of call was Primorsk, Russia, and it is carrying just under 30,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Its next stop, he says, is Aliağa in Turkey. Its end destination is impossible to know, but the Swedish coastguard is certain this ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet.</p> \n<p>The radio call is part of a new government plan aimed at tightening checks on the shadow fleet amid fears of a serious oil spill. The vessels are under no obligation to respond, but so far the coastguard says ships have been cooperative.</p> \n<p>“There are hundreds of [shadow] ships moving in the Baltic all the time. And it’s a lot for our little sea here,” says Håkansson. “We see ships that have never been seen in the Baltic before that we come across now.” They need to build a picture of how seaworthy the ships are, he says, “because if there was an oil accident with these ships there would be an oil catastrophe in the Baltic”.</p> \n<p>Security in the Baltic has changed dramatically since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says Håkansson. As well as the growing shadow fleet, there is increasing disturbance to satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS, and Baltic authorities must keep a close eye on undersea infrastructure. In the event of an oil spill, the coastguard would be responsible for emergency response and clean-up. There is also a growing physical threat from the Russian military, as its presence has “stepped up” in the Baltic, says Håkansson.</p> \n<p>Håkansson also comes across ships he strongly suspects of spying. “Before they had these research ships [for spying]. Lately they have been using cargo ships to do these operations,” he claims. </p> \n<p>But unless there is evidence of an environmental crime, a fishing crime or some sea traffic crimes, the Swedish coastguard’s ability to act on such threats is extremely limited. According to the rules of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that deals with safety and security of shipping, “the shadow fleet is allowed to move freely in the whole of the Baltics”, says Jonatan Tholin, a preliminary investigation manager for the Swedish coastguard.</p> \n<p>National law can only apply in a country’s territorial waters, in the country’s broader economic zone it is the legislation of the country that the flag is shipped in that counts.</p> \n<p>The problems caused by the shadow fleet are exemplified by Eagle S, an oil tanker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/finland-accuses-tanker-crew-sabotage-undersea-cables-anchor\">suspected of damaging five undersea cables</a> by dragging its anchor between Finland and Estonia in December 2024. Finnish authorities filed charges against members of the crew, arguing that although the measures were carried out outside Finland, the effects of the crime materialised in Finland, meaning it falls into its jurisdiction. The crew members deny the charges.</p> \n<p>However, Tholin believes the most dangerous risk of the shadow fleet is its uninsured vessels, which in the event of an oil spill could have huge financial and environmental costs. “It means it will be taxpayer, the state, who pays,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Phil Bellamy’s daughters refuse to ride in his electric car without travel sickness tablets. Are there other solutions?</p>",
    "content": "<p>It was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.</p> <p>As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jun/21/electric-vehicles-carsick\">Research has shown</a> this is an issue – people who did not usually have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">motion sickness</a> in a conventional car found that they did in EVs.</p> <p>For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.</p> <p>“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.</p> <p>Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.</p> <p>The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22674\">Research carried out in China</a>, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.</p> <p>Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@atiahchayne/video/7531869808762146070\">posted on TikTok</a> about her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness\">Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.</p> <p>Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”</p> <p>John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.</p> <p>While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.</p> <p>He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014193822500232X\">such as vibrations in the car seat</a> that warn the passenger when the car is turning.</p> <p>Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.</p>    <h2>How to cope with motion sickness</h2> <p>Experts and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/motion-sickness/\">the NHS suggest</a> behavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.</p> <p><strong>Sit at the front</strong> Knowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.</p> <p><strong>Try motion sickness medications</strong> These come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be taken <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-air-sea/motion-sickness.html#:~:text=most%20effective%20when%20taken%20before%20exposure\">before travelling</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wear </strong><strong>ac</strong><strong>upressure</strong><strong> bands </strong>These are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,<em>” </em>Golding says.</p> <p><strong>Listen to a 100hz sound</strong> for a minute. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11955832/\">Research</a> from Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/13/obsessive-collectors-pay-big-money-personalised-number-plates",
    "description": "<p>Customised plates often cost more than the car – and yet the number of people queueing up to buy them is at an all‑time high. What’s the appeal?</p>",
    "content": "<p>‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.</p> <p>Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a&nbsp;world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit. The question is: why?</p> <p>John Harrison, 75, is known as the “modern godfather” of autonumerology – the hobby of being enormously into registration plates. He tells me over the phone: “You’ve got people who are mainly interested in what I’d call the pattern of numbers, the more technical side; people interested in personal numbers; people interested in foreign plates. I do a bit of all three.” As a&nbsp;child, like many number-plate fans, he scribbled down the ones he saw on the road and started looking up some of their details. He tracked the work of the late Noel&nbsp;Woodall, the hobby’s true OG, who wrote 24 – yes, 24 – books about registration plates. (One of them is called Where’s It From? When Was It Issued?) Harrison has limited himself to just the one title: The Number Plate Book.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, I meet Harrison face to face at the annual Registration Numbers Club rally at the Wythall Transport Museum in Worcestershire – the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comic-con\">Comic-Con</a> for number-plate fans. They convene there to admire one another’s wares and hand out tongue-in-cheek awards, and have done so for almost 50 years.</p>    <p>I also meet Neal Bircher, who might be more interested in number plates than anyone else on the face of the Earth. He is my introduction to the world of Facebook groups for plate fans, and I join one called Private Number Plate Enthusiasts, which is like a&nbsp;birdspotting group for number-plate devotees. Bircher’s car boasts “NEA 1”, and over the years he has owned various iterations of his initials, “NAB”. He also owns “149 PCE”, the number plate on the truck at the heart of Steven Spielberg’s first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/13/duel-at-50-steven-spielberg-debut-thriller\">Duel</a>. He still yearns for “NB1” or “NA1”, or perhaps “A1”, which enthusiasts tend to consider the great white whale of the plate world. “A1” is perhaps the only plate with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_registration_plate\">own Wikipedia page</a>. It is owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, and would sell for multiple millions.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple millions, at the rally I also meet Richard Conway. I know about Conway because I have heard he is selling the “1 HRH” plate on his Bentley for £2.5m. (He doesn’t throw in the Bentley for that price.) It is a valuation that raises eyebrows everywhere I mention it. “Too much,” Harrison says. “If you’re a&nbsp;multimillionaire, two-and-a-half may be peanuts, but to me it sounds, shall we say, somewhat ambitious.”</p> <p>Angela Banh is marketing manager for Regtransfers, which, as the biggest number-plate broker in the country, advertises some plates for millions of pounds. “F1”, which belongs to car entrepreneur Afzal Kahn, was&nbsp;listed on the website until recently and he expects £15m for it. Does she think “1 HRH” is worth £2.5m? “It’s not one that we would value at that kind of figure,” Banh says. “But that doesn’t mean someone’s not going to pay two-and-a-half for it.”</p>    <p>Conway, 50, is an entrepreneur who also owns the Number Plate Company Group Limited. He won’t tell me how much he paid for “1 HRH”, of course, but in 2009 it changed hands at a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) auction for £92,000 plus VAT and fees. He bought it 13 years later, but hadn’t intended on selling it. Like various other enthusiasts, he likens the hobby to collecting expensive paintings. “I might think: ‘What an idiot. They’ve spent £3m on that piece of art.’ But that’s because I don’t understand the market.” He tells me he has already turned down seven-figure offers. What if King Charles tapped him on the shoulder? “I&nbsp;think that’s unlikely,” he smiles. The reverse plate – “HRH 1”, which those in the business consider the “right” way around because the letters come first – was given to Queen Elizabeth II as an engagement present by the original owner. Conway doesn’t seem likely to give his up for free.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Back in Chichester, the price of lot 56 is still rising: £300,000, £310,000, £320,000. The number plate in question is “JB 1”, once the property of Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealer John&nbsp;Barclay. Why is the plate so valuable? Because “JB” has a good claim to being the most common set of initials in the country. (To help them come to an accurate valuation, Regtransfers has a database of names and surnames.) “330,” says the auctioneer. “340 … ” One of the bidders in the room is John Doherty, buy-in manager for Regtransfers, sitting with Banh. He has just bid £350,000. There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people.</p> <p>In 2019, when the DVLA surveyed drivers with an interest in private number plates, they found that 6% wanted them for their business; 17% considered them an investment; and 69% bought them because of a&nbsp;personal connection. The perception of people who go in for personalised number plates isn’t famously positive. Of&nbsp;course, hardcore hobbyists demur, making the point that being really into number plates doesn’t <em>necessarily </em>make you an overcompensating flash prat. “It’s not about ‘Me, me, me – look at me,’” Bircher says. “It’s ‘I find this interesting.’ I say to people, ‘What on earth is showy about the squiggles on the plate on the front of your car?’”</p> <p>One noticeable thing about the enthusiasts is that they tend to be older, white and male. But bucking one of those trends is 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/numberplatehistory/?hl=en\">Kit Joubert</a>, who is making a splash on Instagram with an account devoted to exploring the history of number plates. He presents slick videos in which he discusses notorious plates, always with access to the cars they are on. Joubert thinks that over the last couple of decades the public perception has changed significantly, to the point that a personalised number plate is now simply another part of car customisation. “There’s a shift beginning to happen,” he says, “and I, for better or worse, might be the face of that, at least on social media.” Because there is often an overlap between fast cars and lucrative number plates, the hobby is well suited to visual platforms such as Instagram. Joubert recently organised a meet-up for plate enthusiasts, which he claims was the first to happen without the involvement of the Registration Numbers Club. He wants to make number plates his full-time job in the next year. “It’s changed my life,” he says.</p>    <p>Number plates were introduced to British roads under the 1903 Motor Car Act and, as Harrison explains in his book, at first they were one or two letters (denoting an area of the country), followed by up to four numbers. Harrison believes the first to have been a Hastings plate, “DY 1”. (The letters correlated to the size of the local authority. London, the largest, had “A”. Once the end of the alphabet was reached, “AA” took effect.) After the numbers were used up, letters were added before the two initials. Then, in the 1950s, the reversed format was phased in: “1234 AB”. In the 60s, letters were added to the end, with the “A” suffix in “AMP 595A” denoting 1963, for example. From the 1980s things got increasingly convoluted – one of the many reasons that people yearn for the beautiful simplicity of those early plates.</p> <p>Another explanation for the popularity of plates today is that the DVLA has cottoned on to how much of a cash cow the hobby is. In 1977 the government was plotting to make the transfer of plates more expensive and difficult. “No one could make a convincing claim that he would suffer genuine hardship if he could no longer afford to transfer his cherished mark or his personalised number plate,” <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1977-01-24/debates/0fec342e-5409-4742-8b16-fa86f457252a/RoadVehicles(RegistrationMarkTransfers)\">said the MP John Horam</a>. The Registration Numbers Club formed in opposition to this philosophy, and ultimately won the fight. Now, the DVLA would never seek to make the process more difficult: the DVLA’s head of external communications points me to an <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687e00805f0f5104b9806beb/DVLA_annual_report_and_accounts_2024_to_2025.pdf\">annual report</a> that says in 2024-25 they made more than £274m from personalised number plates. (The organisation charges an £80 fee for every plate sold.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if ‘OAS 1S’ might go for a silly amount. The DVLA are no fools when it comes to the timing of their release</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The DVLA held its first auction in 1989. Initially, it&nbsp;simply sold plates that had already been issued. Over time, however, it has become possible to request&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific plate be created and auctioned. If it is valid and unreleased, it could be yours. Once upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, all of the DVLA’s auctions were in-person, but when attendance fell during the pandemic, it moved&nbsp;them all to its website. In June, I register to check one out.</p> <p>I am interested in this specific auction because I want to know if “OAS 1S” might go for a silly amount of money. (The DVLA is no fool when it comes to the timing of its releases.) Also up for grabs is “95 A”, which Bircher tells me is the first three-character plate to be auctioned in five years. As I watch, I can see the prices rise in real time. At the end of the five-day auction, “OAS 1S” is at £56,040; “95 A” has secured £71,010; but the winner is “8 FU”, which has sold for £90,000. Harrison’s insight is that “Fu” is a common surname in China, where the number eight is also considered lucky.</p>    <p>“FU” brings us to another subject: <a href=\"https://www.regtransfers.co.uk/content/hundreds-2025-plates-banned\">naughty plates</a>. Banh tells me that until 2024, “FU” was suppressed (because of its “fuck you” connotations). As Harrison says in his book, censorship has been a concern since the very beginning. “DD” was originally considered too problematic to have on a car because the initials stood for “drop dead”. When local authorities were allocated two-letter prefixes, Dorset were disgruntled with “BF” because it was considered to stand for “bloody fool”; “666” used to be deemed too offensive for sensitive eyes. “They go around in circles,” Banh says. “What was considered rude many years ago is no longer rude now.” Currently you can have a “PEN 15” but you can’t have an “AR25 HOL”.</p> <p>At the rally I meet Matthew Edwards, 56, who is selling his “S69 CUM” plate for £15,000. (His wife no longer finds it funny.) For a while he also had “K21 KKK” – until the DVLA decided “KKK” was too offensive to be allowed on the road. He had bought it purely to sell it, but that became all but impossible. “I couldn’t give it away,” he says.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in Chichester, “JB 1” has broken the £400,000 barrier. Everyone but Doherty and a&nbsp;mysterious bidder on the phone has dropped out. The bidding goes up to £410,000, then £420,000, then £430,000. When it creeps up to £500,000, an audible murmur goes around the room. The record is within touching distance.</p> <p>“Is it any different from adorning your car with anything else – to having a special paint job, or having some bolt-on goodie? I don’t know,” says Nicholas Young, 76, as I sit in his Rolls-Royce (number plate “NY 1”). Young, whose fascination lies in the history of number plates, concedes that it is “childish and stupid” to buy plates because they match your initials. He also admits that’s exactly what he’s done.</p> <p>Young has also written his own book – the colossal Car Number Classics (“I was impressed not only by its weight, but certainly more by its contents!” one of the reviewers said) – and he has no interest in treating the plates as a way to get rich. “If I say I christened my son after a number plate, that really does sound sad,” he says, “but his name is the same as mine. So they’ll go to him.”</p>    <p>In Chichester, the anonymous bidder on the phone is head-to-head with Doherty. They’re at £500,000. “510,” the auctioneer says. He looks at Doherty, who nods. “520,” he says. With that, it has broken the UK record. Joubert, who is standing feet away from me, is well aware of this. “530,” the auctioneer says, taking a bid from the phone. There is a silence. “530,” he repeats, looking at Doherty. He shakes his head. As the auctioneer raises his hammer, fireworks crash somewhere above our heads. “530,000,” he says, banging his hammer. The room breaks out into applause. It is an astonishing turn of events. With the addition of fees and VAT, “JB&nbsp;1” has sold for £608,600. Is it simply three squiggles on a&nbsp;sheet of metal? Or is it a priceless piece of history? As&nbsp;Edwards says: “You either get it or you don’t.”</p> <p>Who is the mysterious new owner of “JB 1”? Weeks later, I hear back from the auctioneer who had the bidder on the other end of the phone. I wanted to know if they might be willing to speak to me. “I spoke to the buyer,” he says. Yes? “And I can confirm they would like to remain anonymous.” Damn. “However, they are fine to say that they have the initials JB.” Justin&nbsp;Bieber? Joe&nbsp;Biden? Jeff&nbsp;Bezos? Jack Black? James Blunt? Juliette Binoche, perhaps? I have chosen to believe it was Jim&nbsp;Broadbent. But we may never know. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Raghuvamsh Chavali was born in Hyderabad, India, and now calls Canada – or more specifically Guelph in Ontario – his home. He&nbsp;describes his adopted city as “a peaceful and&nbsp;friendly place, with&nbsp;a mix of heritage buildings and modern life”. It also proved an ideal backdrop for his extended photographic series Wings Over Concrete, which explores the presence and movement of birds in urban environments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/30/ed-templeton-best-phone-picture\">‘The surfers were methodical and mesmerising’: Ed Templeton’s best phone picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before he took this image, one cloudy afternoon in downtown Guelph, Chavali had been tracking this particular flock of pigeons for several weeks. “I was in search of the natural patterns of&nbsp;birds, and I’d seen this&nbsp;flock flying in circles around the buildings near a train station at the&nbsp;same time each day. They moved in a tight, repeated loop, and on this day the light was soft and just right to capture their movement clearly,” he says. He&nbsp;utilised his phone camera’s slo-mo mode “to create a visual that almost feels like it was drawn with light. Their flight formed a fluid, layered pattern, like an&nbsp;S-shaped ribbon floating in space.”</p> <p>Chavali immediately knew he’d captured something special, converting the photo to&nbsp;black and white to remove distractions and&nbsp;emphasise texture. He&nbsp;notes a “kind of visual poetry and a&nbsp;reminder that wonder can be found in quiet, overlooked places. These birds have adapted to concrete spaces we have built over their habitats, yet&nbsp;they continue to move through the city with elegance and ease.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/13/ralph-lauren-and-michael-kors-show-a-breezy-romantic-vision-of-the-us",
    "description": "<p>The American dream has never looked more seductive, with long and loose summer wardrobes and beachy jewellery</p>",
    "content": "<p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p> <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p> <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p> <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this New York fashion week, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p> <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p> <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p> <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before New York fashion week began.</p> <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p> <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>  ",

    "description": "<p>Combining both salty and sour flavours, gherkins act as a great elevator for many a dish or just as a standalone snack. But whose strikes the perfect balance?</p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/27/from-kimchi-to-kombucha-its-easy-to-ferment-at-home-heres-the-kit-you-need\"><strong>From kimchi to kombucha, it’s easy to ferment at home. Here’s all the kit you need</strong></a></p>",
    "content": "<p>A jar of gherkins reminds me of the sea around the British Isles – murky, seaweed-green and mysterious – and of that bizarre marine animal, the sea cucumber (though sea gherkin would perhaps be more accurate, given how similar some species look). Gherkins also happen to be one of my favourite foods, though I usually eat them straight from the jar and rarely save any for all those recipes that benefit from their addition, from potato salads to bloody marys.</p> <p>I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p> <p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed? </p> <p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

The jar is packed with dill and mustard seeds, and pieces of pepper. Very sweet at first, then the sourness cuts through, followed by complex mustard and ginger notes, and a fragrant dill finish. An impressively clean ingredients list and a very low salt content (<a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/baxters-whole-gherkins-crunchy-tangy-600g/113375597#:~:text=Salt-,0.86g,-Similar%20Products\">0.86%</a>).

Incredible value.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best bargain</em><em>:</em><em><br></em>Melis pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/melis-pickled-gherkins-720ml/105961596\" > £1.80 for 680g at Morrisons (26p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/3507847\" > £1.90 for 680g at Asda (28p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Bendy, small and dark green, with a sweet, savoury and piquant flavour from the whole red chilli peppers and garlic cloves (both delicious bonus snacks when you reach the bottom of the jar). Even though they’re pasteurised, there’s a slight lacto-funk, too (either because they’ve started to re-ferment or these are residual flavours from pre-pasteurisation), which I like. <em>Very</em> salty, though (3.75%).</p> <p>***</p> <h2>And the rest …</h2> <h2>Kühne gourmet gherkins with herbs</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/kuhne-gourmet-selection-gherkins-with-herbs/582929-805767-805768\" > £2.85 for 530g at Waitrose (54p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/kuhne-gourmet-gherkins-with-herbs/575084011\" > £3 for 530g at Ocado (57p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★★☆</p> <p>More cornichons than gherkins, so very different from the others tested. Yellowy-green, with a long flavour profile that moves from dill and onion to sourness, salt and, finally, mustard and black pepper. The crunch is perfect, too. A 10th-generation German brand with a simple recipe; the salt content is a little high, but no artificial stuff in here. Good value, given the sheer quality.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Asda pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/pickled-onions-vegetables/asda-pickled-gherkins-680g/3778220\" > £1.13 for 680g at Asda (17p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small, moss-green and with a very tangy flavour and sharp mustard heat. A simple flavour profile with a lovely, celery-like note that lingers. Not too salty, and the crunch is good. Calcium chloride-free, too, which is worth noting for those avoiding additives.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Tesco gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/280068606\" > £1.15 for 680g at Tesco (17p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small, army-green and with a sharp, extra sour flavour and a salty kick. The taste is one-dimensional, but they do the job. Less crunchy and more watery than most, but still good value for a straightforward pickle.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Morrisons whole gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/morrisons-whole-gherkins-680g/105096328\" > £1.40 for 680g at Morrisons (21p/100g) </a>  <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p>Small and knobbly, with a sweet aroma. The flavour also opens with sweetness, moves into a gentle sourness, then a touch of mustard. While there’s nothing to complain about, these don’t offer much in the way of complexity or interest, but, that said, they’re nicely crunchy. A solid, good-value option.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Epicure whole pickles with dill and red pepper</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/309766369\" > £3.75 for 970g at Tesco (39p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/epicure-original-whole-pickles/587054011\" > £3.75 for 970g at Ocado (39p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized gherkin with a juniper-green hue. Balanced, sweet-sour flavour with strong savoury notes of onion and red pepper, and not over salty. The crunch is OK, but not excellent. Contains “flavourings”. This product won two Great Taste stars in 2022, so perhaps the recipe has changed since?</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Mrs Elswood haimisha gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers-670g\" > £2.50 for 670g at Sainsbury’s (37p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/mrs-elswood-haimisha-cucumbers/034470-17297-17298\" > £2.90 for 670g at Waitrose (43p/100g) </a>  <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p>A good-sized, bendy “wally” (as my London-born stepdad used to say) with a golden olive hue. The flavour is dominated by salt, which overwhelms any nuance aside from lingering dill and onion notes. The crunch is decent, though. Mrs Elswood is a heritage brand, <a href=\"https://www.mrselswood.com/about#:~:text=CONTACT-,SINCE%201947,-The%20story%20of\">founded in 1947</a>, that shows more consideration for sustainability than some. Uses additives, though, which detracts from the overall appeal.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Sainsbury’s pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-pickled-gherkins-340g-7863266-p-44\" > £1.35 for 340g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g) </a>  <p>★☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A cocktail-sized, mossy-hued green gherkin. Has a soupy and quite sweet preserved aroma, with strong capsicum and onion notes. Unfortunately, the spirit vinegar hits harshly at the back of the throat. The crunch is very good, though. These contain sulphites, which are unnecessary additives of potential concern, especially when simpler recipes are tastier.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dawtona pickled gherkins</h2>      <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.asda.com/groceries/product/pickled-onions-vegetables/dawtona-gherkins-pickled-cucumbers-in-vinegar-brine-with-spices-900-g/9105186\" > £1.94 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g) </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/262299348\" > £2.90 for 900g at Tesco (32p/100g) </a>  <p>☆☆☆☆☆</p> <p>A decent-sized snozzcumber (as Roald Dahl’s BFG might say), ranging in colour from dark army-green to iridescent yellow chartreuse, but, sadly, I think I had a spoiled jar. There’s a slight saltiness, but it’s overshadowed by a stale flavour that’s hard to ignore, plus the texture is softer and moister than you’d expect. As a result, these are disqualified – sorry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Buttons\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/business/media/severance-the-pitt-emmys.html\">current state of the television business</a>. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Severance</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Andor</p> <h2><strong>Best comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Abbott Elementary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/26/the-bear-season-four-review-finally-becoming-the-show-it-was-always-destined-to-be\">The Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/11/hacks-season-four-review-the-return-of-this-extremely-funny-hugely-raw-comedy-is-a-sheer-pleasure\">Hacks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/27/only-murders-in-the-building-season-four-review-by-far-the-funniest-thing-on-tv\">Only Murders in the Building</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/shrinking-season-two-review-harrison-ford-comedy-apple-tv\">Shrinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/26/the-studio-review-seth-rogens-hollywood-satire-is-fast-furious-and-beautifully-fun\">The Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny\">What We Do in the Shadows</a></p> <p>Another interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Studio</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Hacks</p> <h2><strong>Best limited or anthology series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/17/adolescence-netflix-powerful-tv-could-save-lives\">Adolescence</a>, Black Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv\">Dying for Sex</a>, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The Penguin</p> <p>Of all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/09/france-netflix-uk-drama-adolescence-teach-toxic-masculinity-schools\">fixture in secondary school programs</a> across Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/29/the-adolescence-alarm-if-theres-a-problem-with-boys-behaviour-its-because-of-us\">thematic lightning rod</a>, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adolescence</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a drama series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pedro-pascal\">Pedro Pascal</a> (The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)</p> <p>It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Noah Wyle</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)</p> <p>Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Kathy Bates</p> <h2><strong>Lead actor in a comedy series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)</p> <p>If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into the Emmys with 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>Seth Rogen</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>Adam Brody</p> <h2><strong>Lead actress in a comedy series</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)</p> <p>Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win.

Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario.

But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.</p> <p><strong>Will win: </strong>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</p> <p><strong>Should win: </strong>The Daily Show</p> <h2><strong>Supporting actor in a drama series</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)</p> <p>Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast.

    "content": "<h2>Why Terence Crawford will beat Canelo Álvarez</h2> \n<p>For years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/terence-crawford\">Bud Crawford</a>’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so complete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/30/terence-crawford-after-spence-win-im-pound-for-pound-no-1-without-a-doubt\">it cemented his place</a> in boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/terence-crawford-profile-canelo-alvarez-fight\">Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a5ca207-01c6-4e22-8a75-8e43030f4b13\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\"><b>Canelo v Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What's happening?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where and when is the fight?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What belts are on the line?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where can I watch it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who else is fighting?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights</p>\n    <p>• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights</p>\n    <p>• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights</p>\n    <p>• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights</p>\n    <p>• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweight</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Main card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights</p>\n    <p>• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights</p>\n    <p>• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championship</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Canelo’s vulnerabilities are not theoretical. Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/watch-canelo-alvarez-v-terence-crawford-netflix\">Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.</p> \n<p>Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-how-boxing-won-the-lottery-but-lost-the-ticket-again\">present company included</a>. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.</p> \n<p>The weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.</p> \n<p>The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Why Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence Crawford</h2> \n<p>Next month it will be 20 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez\">Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez</a> made his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.</p> \n<p>Years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/saul-canelo-alvarez-i-want-to-keep-fighting-my-whole-life-i-so-enjoy-it\">he confided</a> that “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”</p> \n<p>Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The great Terence Crawford is, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/12/alvarez-and-crawford-face-off-in-breathless-blockbuster-destined-to-break-records\">Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break records</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-boxing-fight-arlington-texas-report-result\">sharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tyson</a> in 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.</p> \n<p>Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.</p> \n<p>Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.</p> \n<p>This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.</p> \n<p>Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/04/terence-crawford-beats-israil-madrimov-to-become-four-division-champion\">looked diminished against Israil Madrimov</a> – who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.</p> \n<p>Álvarez <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/04/canelo-alvarez-terence-crawford-william-scull-fight\">looked terrible in his last fight</a>, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/11/jaron-boots-ennis-eimantas-stanionis-fight-preview\">Jaron “Boots” Ennis</a>, who would test Crawford at welterweight.</p> \n<p>Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez\">he was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013</a>, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.</p> \n<p>But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.</p> \n<p>Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Priestdaddy author on quitting social media, Maga conspiracies and how her second novel grew out of a period of post-Covid mania</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patricia-lockwood\">Patricia Lockwood</a> does whenever she spots a priest while walking through an airport. The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like: <em>I know</em>.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.</p> <p>This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-gilbert\">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> than a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.</p> <p>So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”</p> <p>All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experienced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”</p> <p>I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.</p> <p>The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”</p>    <p>As I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”</p> <p>These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked about <em>cancel culture</em>. It is my greatest fear, to be asked about <em>cancel culture</em> – or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I&nbsp;will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”</p> <p>This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very&nbsp;exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.</p> <p>Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\">Priestdaddy</a>, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/26/patricia-lockwood-poem-rape-joke\">Rape Joke</a>, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.</p> <p>In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/12/no-one-is-talking-about-this-by-patricia-lockwood-review-life-in-the-twittersphere\">No One Is Talking About This</a>, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born with <a href=\"https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/proteus-syndrome/\">Proteus syndrome</a>, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”</p>    <p>In the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.</p> <p>Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”</p> <p>Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”</p> <p>The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”</p> <p>On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”</p> <p><em>• Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

    "content": "<p>Is it still safe to stage the World Cup in the United States? After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.</p> <p>The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/florian-wirtz-liverpool-newcastle-nick-woltemade-gambling-philipp-lahm\">Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp Lahm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friend Donald Trump.</p> <p>Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar\">I feel like a concerned black African football tourist</a>. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.</p> <p>You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.</p> <p>But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter: Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.</p> <p>It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.</p>    <p>And as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic, Portugal are in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.</p> <p>This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/01/cristiano-ronaldo-faces-us1bn-lawsuit-for-promoting-binance-nfts\">collapsed into legal chaos</a>, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.</p> <p>What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.</p> <p>Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/04/us-court-to-hear-arguments-over-payment-in-cristiano-ronaldo-allegation-case\">no-admission no-guilt payoff</a> to make the whole thing stop.</p> <p>The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.</p>    <p>And now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.</p> <p>Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).</p> <p>And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.</p> <p>For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.</p> <p>Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.</p> <p>He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.</p>    <p>For all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.</p> <p>Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.</p> <p>What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.</p> <p>This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/12/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.</p> <p>Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn’t been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.</p> <p>There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America’s public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the Guardian University Guide 2026. It can feel like it’s all change in universities these days – exams are increasingly a thing of the past, you can tune into lectures online, and now there’s the tricky business of working out whether ChatGPT is your studying friend or foe.</p> <p>This year’s guide will help you understand how technology is reshaping the university experience, and how to make the most of it – from landing a place on a course you love, to getting ready for the jobs of the future.</p> <p>The Guardian rankings will help you figure out which universities give their students the best experience, rather than just showing you which are strongest in academic research, like most other league tables.</p> <p>We rank universities through eight different scores, which form a total out of 100. These include what students say about their teaching and feedback in the annual National Student Survey.</p> <p>We also look at how big class sizes are through the student-to-staff ratio and how much universities spend on teaching each student. Other areas covered are students’ A-level grades and whether their academic performance improves at university (the value-added score), and how likely they are to persevere with their course. There’s also data on how many students get graduate jobs 15 months after leaving university. For each metric, we use the most recent data available at the time of publication. Any blank spaces mean there is data missing, so we focus on the other measures.</p> <p>In the guide, you will find our overall league table of UK universities as well as individual subject profiles and tables. This year, we have a special table showing you the universities and courses that graduates were least likely to regret. We’ve also got lots of advice to help you make up your mind and start planning for university, from how to take advantage of clearing to which universities offer a buzzing student nightlife.</p> <p>The rankings change annually, and some universities may benefit from temporary measures such as funding boosts or changes to their student intake. Don’t forget that universities languishing at the bottom of the overall table can be top for certain subjects – so check out our subject tables and profiles to build up a full picture.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The incoming vice-chancellor, Prof Frances Bowen, credits the student-focused approach at the University of Essex for its soaring rankings and high satisfaction rating</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/the-guardian-university-guide-2026-the-rankings\"><strong>The 2026 league table</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide\"><strong>View the full guide</strong></a></p></li></ul>",
    "content": "<p>At the University of Essex’s open days this summer, only a few staff took particular notice of one inquisitive visitor talking to prospective students and parents – but that “mystery shopper” turned out to be Essex’s&nbsp;next vice-chancellor. Prof Frances Bowen became Essex’s senior leader in August, and took advantage of her anonymity before that to see its Colchester campus through the eyes of potential applicants and their families.</p> <p>What stood out from her undercover experience was that “the passion for the place was really clear from our students, from staff,” – as well as the more surprising perspectives of parents touring the campus.</p> <p>“Interacting with parents, many of the questions were the ones you would expect, for example, employability prospects, what the programme would be like, and what the contact hours would be,” says Prof Bowen.</p> <p>“The thing I wasn’t expecting was how much interest they would have in the overall offer, meaning the accommodation and the life on campus as a whole.</p> <p>“I’m a lifelong academic, I have attended lots and lots of open days as an academic, and from that point of view you can think it’s all about the course. But from the mystery shopper point of view, it was really clear that it was the whole package, the whole experience, that was really important.”</p> <p>This reflects Bowen’s attitude towards seeking to really understand students’ needs, which she says is a long-running feature of Essex’s “safe and sensible” approach. It was this, as well as its academic heritage, that attracted her to the job.</p> <p>Her arrival – following Prof Anthony Forster’s retirement in 2024 after 11 years as vice-chancellor – comes as Essex rises to its highest-ever position in the Guardian University Guide’s overall rankings. More than five years ago, as the Covid pandemic appeared, Essex slipped to 85th overall. But since then it has been on a steady upwards march, to 23rd position last year and up again to 12th this year.</p> <p>Bowen acknowledges that “it’s taken a decade of hard work” by the university to get there, and comes alongside the university’s highest-ever research income, meaning that she takes over at a high point for both sides of its mission.</p> <p>The Guardian University Guide analysis shows Essex has a wide array of strong undergraduate degrees, including the top national ranking for drama and dance courses. One of the new campus universities founded in the 1960s, alongside the likes of York and Warwick, Essex remains strong in social sciences such as economics and international relations, but its courses in anatomy and physiology, biology, nursing and mathematics are also ranked in the top 10 this year.</p> <p>Essex’s performance has been helped by its buoyant staff-student ratios, and its ability to get the most out of its students in value-added measures, showing that its graduates emerge with better degree results than their previous grades would suggest.</p> <p>One of the university’s greatest strengths, in Bowen’s eyes, “is the work that Essex has done, not just recently and not since it was just fashionable to do so, the really hard work in figuring out who our students are and how best to meet their needs – their actual needs, rather than what we imagine [them] to be”.</p> <p>As an example of the university’s pragmatism, Bowen explains the “Come on in” campaign run in association with Essex’s student union, designed to encourage students back into lectures and classes in person, through posters and screens.</p> <p>“Where this comes from is the basic question: why do students not come to lectures? Or, what is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that stops the student from coming on to campus? “And once you start unpacking this, one of the main reasons we discovered why students do not walk into that lecture, it’s because when they get there they don’t know anybody and they don’t have anybody to go in with. It’s often as simple as&nbsp;that.”</p> <p>The current cohort of students went through lockdowns at school, where they “maybe missed that type of social connection and confidence to walk into a room full of strangers and participate,” she says.</p> <p>“There are students who are also working part-time. They may have done an extra shift. They tried to come on the bus but the bus was late. And they get there, and the lecture has started, and they’re standing outside the lecture theatre, and the ‘Come on in’ poster is on the door saying: come on in. You are welcome even if you’re late, even if you’re on your own, just step inside,” she says.</p> <p>“There’s something very pragmatic about it, and there are lots of examples like that where I think Essex has really done a good job of getting those things right. It doesn’t matter what the ratio of staff&nbsp;to student is inside the class if you don’t even walk in.”</p> <p>The campaign appears to have been a success, with student retention rates and lecture attendance improved since the start of the messaging.</p>    <p>Originally from south Wales – and the first in her family to attend university – Bowen understands that not all students are from backgrounds familiar with the ins and outs of academic life.</p> <p>“One of the things that we have to work quite hard on is helping people understand what university actually is, rather than what they might have read in the media or imagine what it might be. We’re not some kind of, you know, traditional extended boarding school or something like that. We’re not some ivory tower. We have a lot of research excellence, but we’re not that sort of rarefied place,” she says.</p> <p>Nearly half of Essex’s students come from families where there has not been a tradition of higher education, while 18% have a disability in some form. To prepare incoming students, the university offers what it calls the Essex preparation programme.</p> <p>“It’s essentially an online learning module about how to think about coming to university. And students get a £250 bursary if they complete the course before the start of their studies. The take-up of that is really good. It costs us money but it’s worth every penny – our figures indicate students are more successful and they’re less likely to drop out if they complete the programme,” Bowen explains.</p> <p>“And it also links into all of the extra support and opportunities we offer when students arrive, because if they just arrive cold at the start of ‘welcome week’ it can be an utterly overwhelming experience.”</p> <p>Like almost every other UK university, Essex’s finances have been hit by the erosion of domestic tuition fee income and the drop-off in international students. And like many others it has endured cost-cutting and redundancies, with little hope for any immediate relief.</p> <p>The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) also threatens to upset traditional university practices but Bowen says the clock cannot be turned back: “We’re grappling with it in terms of the whole student experience, not just assessment … I think we’ve got to accept that students arriving at university today have already been using generative AI for years. So the real question is how we can adapt to that reality.</p> <p>“Employers consistently tell us that they want graduates who are curious, who can think critically and creatively, and thankfully those skills are at the very heart of higher education. But we do need to design curriculums and assessments that maintain rigour and fairness, with students using AI thoughtfully, ethically and effectively.”</p> <h2>Movers and shakers: who’s climbing high in the University Guide 2026?</h2> <p><strong>Modern movers<br></strong>Although the top 10 spots are mostly claimed by the UK’s older institutions, this year lots of modern universities have climbed up the rankings, often due to quality teaching and the good employment prospects their vocational courses offer graduates. One especially meteoric ascent belongs to the<strong> University of East London</strong>, which has continued its annual scale up the rankings, leaping this year from 56th to 33rd. Meanwhile, <strong>Southampton</strong> <strong>Solent </strong>has climbed into the top 60 for the first time in its history, and <strong>Goldsmiths</strong> has jumped from 109th to 67th – a position it has not reached since 2018.</p> <p><strong>Grateful graduates<br></strong>In our new graduate choice data, healthcare subjects are among those which recent graduates are most likely to feel glad they studied. This year, <strong>Cardiff</strong>’s general nursing course has soared from 45th to 8th out of 76 providers, and its mental health nursing course rose from 41st to 10th. Graduates of construction, surveying and planning were similarly satisfied – <strong>Derby</strong>’s course could be a good pick for prospective students, since it climbed from 37th to 5th out of 41 providers.</p> <p><strong>Engineering excellence<br></strong>There are so many different kinds of engineering course, choosing the right one for you can be daunting – so check out our subject tables to get a sense of how they differ. If you’re interested in mechanical engineering, <strong>Heriot-Watt</strong> climbed from 45th to 8th in our rankings in this year’s guide, while<strong> Leicester</strong>’s course soared from 40th to 6th. For electrical and electronic engineering,<strong> Derby</strong> rose from 38th to 6th, and <strong>Robert Gordon</strong> climbed from 33rd to 5th out of 58 providers. <strong>Derby</strong>’s civil engineering course had a similar upward trajectory: from 32nd to 5th.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The time and money you invest in education should be repaid by a rewarding career, but is that always the case? </p>",
    "content": "<p>Is a university degree still worth it? That question has been asked for decades but with increased frequency over the last 10 years, as the cost of taking a degree has shifted from government to graduates.</p> <p>The short answer is: yes it is, according to experts such as the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/impact-undergraduate-degrees-lifetime-earnings\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> (IFS). But as undergraduates in England now finish their courses with tuition and maintenance loans averaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/20/students-in-england-graduate-average-debt-increase\">£53,000</a>, the longer answer is that it’s complicated.</p> <p>Every graduate’s earnings are affected by other factors: how wealthy their family are, how well they did at school, as well as gender and ethnicity. But some factors can be changed, namely where they go to university and what course they study.</p> <p>And to make it more complicated, there are the non-financial benefits such as evidence of <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00306-7/fulltext\">longer lifespans</a> and better <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/documents/ukeo-does-studying-an-undergraduate-degree-make-you-wealthier-and-happier.pdf\">personal wellbeing</a> than for non-graduates.</p> <p>Prof Bobby Duffy, director of King’s College London’s policy institute, says: “There is still a <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/field/downloads/2024-05/UUK-graduate-employment-outcomes-analysis.pdf\">graduate premium</a> that is somewhere on average between £200,000 to £400,000 in lifetime earnings, depending on a lot of things.</p> <p>“It’s a complex area, there’s lots of variation within courses. But on average you still earn more over your lifetime than the costs of going to university and the lost earnings [while studying]. That’s the pure financial case.</p> <p>“There’s also all the work that’s been done on the&nbsp;personal benefits and societal benefits of university. There’s substantial evidence of independent benefits on skills development, self-esteem, sense of wellbeing, civic engagement and openness to diversity. And then there are ultimately benefits to health and longevity that are not explained by other things but are explained by university attendance. And that leads to benefits to&nbsp;society.”</p> <p>But Duffy points out that the financial element of the graduate premium has declined over time. That shouldn’t come as a surprise. At the start of the 1960s only about 4% of school leavers entered higher education, rising to nearer 14% by the end of the 1970s.</p> <p>Fifty years later, more than one in three students go directly into higher education from school, and they are joined by more of their peers in the years that follow, so that Tony Blair’s aim of 50% of young people experiencing higher education by the age of 30 has been achieved.</p> <p>Andy Westwood, professor of public policy at the University of Manchester and a director of the Productivity Institute, says: “Inevitably with that growth you’ve seen a diversification in the types of institutions and experiences, and their [financial] returns. It’s not as if every option is going to work for everybody but a lot of options will.”</p> <p>New graduate choice data supplied to the Guardian by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) shows wide variations in terms of university and course satisfaction, in surveys taken after entering the workforce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/x8BNV/1/\" data-alt=\"Student satisfaction graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/x8BNV/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Those who graduated in 2023 in medicine and health sciences courses, including dentistry and midwifery, were the most satisfied with their choice of course, followed by architecture, computer science and construction courses. All of the top 10 are degrees with a vocational component that offer good employment prospects. Those who studied journalism, marketing or social work were the most likely to regret their choices.</p> <p>Graduates of Oxford were most satisfied with their choice of institution – but in second place comes the University of Sheffield, which was more&nbsp;popular among its graduates than some other universities that come higher in the Guardian’s overall rankings, such as Cambridge or the London School of Economics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kb30o/1/\" data-alt=\"Education establishment satisfaction chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kb30o/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Tony Blair’s assumption was that funding more people to go to university would itself create higher growth. But the UK’s regional inequalities and 15 years of flat or low wage growth have proved it wrong. “Universities and their graduates are not going to be immune from those wider problems,” Westwood says.</p> <p>He argues that the current system places a lot of power into the hands of 17- and 18-year-olds, and their families, to choose from a wide variety of courses, some of which offer attractive careers with high pay and some of which don’t, sometimes from the same university.</p> <p>Economics degrees typically offer some of the highest <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.kernohan/viz/LEO202223byprovider/Dashboard2\">pay for recent graduates</a> but especially for those from select universities, with graduates of Cambridge, the LSE and University College London at the peak.</p> <p>The top seven universities see their economics graduates paid more than £60,000 five years after graduation. But the bottom seven institutions show earnings of £35,000 or less. </p> <p>Even a good degree in English from a UK university only leads to average salaries of £33,000 five years after graduation. But those averages can conceal further variations affected by gender and family background, with the value of a degree based on what non-graduate peers with the same exam grades earn.</p> <p>Research by the IFS revealed a paradox, that those with the lowest graduate earnings also received the largest boost to their earnings from attending university, such as students from the most deprived backgrounds. “The reason is that the earnings prospects of these groups are very low on average if they do not attend university,” the IFS&nbsp;says.</p> <p>But it is the graduate’s own decisions about career paths that have a major influence over what they earn. Rachel Beauchamp, an employability coach at the University of Lancaster’s careers advisory services, says she helps humanities graduates understand that they have gained valuable, career-enhancing skills that go beyond the specific subjects such as history or English they have studied.</p> <p>“Employers are coming to me saying that they want students who can analyse complex problems, who can see different perspectives, and who can connect ideas in new ways,” Beauchamp says. “It’s about encouraging our students, and society to some extent, to see the value of humanities subjects, for their critical thinking, creativity and cultural understanding. Those are the human skills that are developed through those subjects.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Exclusive: A third of those polled do not tell bosses about use of tools and half think AI threatens the social structure</p>",
    "content": "<p>It is the work shortcut that dare not speak its name. A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.</p> <p>Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.</p> <p>Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.</p> <p>The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.</p> <p>Next week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess\">state visit to the UK</a> by Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.</p> <p>The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/dhanushi-lost-her-job-the-same-day-cba-rolled-out-an-ai-chatbot-it-may-just-be-the-beginning\">‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743\">has said</a> he wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p> <p>The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01901-x\">US study</a> circulated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.</p> <p>Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.</p> <p>“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”</p> <p>A study by the Henley Business School in May found 49% of workers reported there were no formal guidelines for AI use in their workplace and more than a quarter felt their employer did not offer enough support.</p> <p>Prof Keiichi Nakata at the school said people were more comfortable about being transparent in their use of AI than 12 months earlier but “there are still some elements of AI shaming and some stigma associated with AI”.</p> <p>He said: “Psychologically, if you are confident with your work and your expertise you can confidently talk about your engagement with AI, whereas if you feel it might be doing a better job than you are or you feel that you will be judged as not good enough or worse than AI, you might try to hide that or avoid talking about it.”</p> <p>OpenAI’s head of solutions engineering for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Matt Weaver, said: “We’re seeing huge demand from business leaders for company-wide AI rollouts – because they know using AI well isn’t a shortcut, it’s a skill. Leaders see the gains in productivity and knowledge sharing and want to make that available to everyone.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mille Colling and Emma Aalto given go-ahead to compete in qualifier for national championships next month</p>",
    "content": "<p>A British ice dancer and her skating partner are to become Finland’s first same-sex team to take part in a competition after a rule change by the country’s skating federation.</p> <p>Millie Colling, 20, who was born in Gateshead and moved to Finland at the age of six, and Emma Aalto, 19, will compete in a qualifier for the national championships next month after pressing for an amendment to the rules to allow them to enter as a team.</p> <p>The pair said they were “best friends that want to skate together”. Their request was supported by their coach, Neil Brown, who helped persuade the skating federation to agree new rules, referring to ice dance partners as Skater A and Skater B instead of man and woman.</p> <p>Colling, an art student, enrolled at skating school a year after her family moved to Finland, and Aalto, a fashion student, has been skating since she was five years old. They met two years ago.</p> <p>“We were immediately on the same level, we really clicked,” said Colling. They began to skate together but “at that point we hadn’t seen any other same-gender skating teams”.</p> <p>But this year, the retired Olympic champions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sports/papadakis-hubbell-skate-together-promote-same-sex-pairs-competition-2025-02-06/\">Madison Hubbell and Gabriella Papadakis performed together</a>, hoping to help break gender stereotypes in the sport. Colling said: “It was completely new and we were, whoa, OK.”</p>    <p>It was a “common misconception” that same-sex teams were gay or in a relationship, she added. “There are lots of queer athletes, and we really admire them. But it’s not the case that in order to be in a non-traditional team you have to be queer.”</p> <p>Aalto said: “The point is to be opening possibilities for everyone, not just for queer people.” Ice dancing with a same-sex partner was “not necessarily any different”, she said.</p> <p>Colling added: “One of us leads, one follows, one lifts, one of us is lifted. We have quite similar body mass, so technically there are some differences, but we still do the same content.”</p> <p>“Every partnership is different,” said Aalto. “Every couple has their own strengths and weaknesses, and their programmes are built around those strengths and weaknesses. Ice dance is a really individual sport – each couple is unique, and we’re just another unique couple.”</p> <p>If the duo qualify, they would be unable to take part in the national competition in December, as that requires further changes. “The federation has said we can’t do it yet – but fingers crossed for the future,” Colling said.</p> <p>The pair hope their participation in the qualifier will be a strong signal of change to the ice dance community and the public. They do not expect to win – “we’re just excited to get out there”, Colling said.</p> <p>They said they felt free and happy while skating. “You stop being a normal version of yourself. You can be whatever you want on the ice,” Aalto said. “It’s the best feeling – it feels like home.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 28-year-old man has been charged with arson after a fire wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said Joshua Oliver had been charged after the blaze at the offices of the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, which broke out in the early hours of Thursday.</p> <p>The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases and an NHS mental health service for veterans, which were based in the same building.</p> <p>Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>Christopher Atkinson, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Joshua Oliver with arson following a police investigation into a fire at the offices of Sharon Hodgson MP.</p> <p>“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with Northumbria police as they carried out their investigation.”</p> <p>Oliver, of no fixed address, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Saturday. The CPS urged people not to share information online that could prejudice the legal proceedings.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. After the fire, a spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 33-year-old man has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years for his role in a gangland shooting outside an east London restaurant, which left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet lodged in her brain.</p> <p>The girl was hit in the head by one of six bullets fired by a man on a Ducati Monster motorbike as she ate ice-cream with her family in the Evin restaurant in Kingsland High Street, Hackney, on 29 May last year.</p> <p>She was an innocent victim of a bloody rivalry between Turkish gangs from north London. Three men at a nearby table were also injured.</p> <p>Javon Riley, 33, from Tottenham, north London, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/18/javon-riley-man-found-guilty-for-role-in-east-london-shooting-of-nine-year-old-girl-evin-restaurant-dalston\">found guilty last month at the Old Bailey</a> of causing grievous harm with intent to the girl and attempting to murder Mustafa Kiziltan, 35, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Nasser Ali, 44.</p> <p>Sentencing Riley on Friday, Judge Lucraft KC said the shooting was part of a dispute between two rival gangs, the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks.</p> <p>He said: “Over the last 10 years, this ongoing feud has seen a series of tit-for-tat murders and attempted murders in London and overseas.</p> <p>“In this case, your acts, and those of the others involved, mean that a nine-year-old girl and her family will have to cope with the life-changing injuries she has sustained through the mindless violence of you and others.”</p> <p>The three men who were shot were said to be affiliated with the Hackney Turks, which had a rivalry with the Tottenham Turks, with whom Riley had links, jurors had heard.</p> <p>The gunman remains at large but prosecutors said Riley had played a “key role” before, during and after the shooting.</p> <p>Riley carried out reconnaissance of the restaurant before the attack, scouted for potential targets and drove the gunman away in a stolen car, which was later burned out.</p> <p>The nine-year-old girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, spent three months in hospital and will suffer lifelong physical and cognitive problems as the bullet remains lodged in her brain.</p> <p>The three male victims received gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and thigh.</p> <p>A victim impact statement from the girl’s mother, read to the court by the judge on Friday, said the family had moved to the UK to seek a “brighter future” for their daughter, who loved gymnastics and playing the guitar.</p> <p>The statement said: “Our daughter’s joyful spirit remains, but it is now wrapped in layers of frustration and silent pain. She watches her friends do what she cannot and she carries it all inside with quiet strength.</p> <p>“This tragedy did not just change our daughter’s life, it broke something in us as a family. Every time we see her struggle, we ask ourselves why we came here and what we could have done differently. The guilt and helplessness are unbearable. For us, the trauma is relentless.</p> <p>“We live with constant fear about the future, unsure of how much more she will lose as she grows. We grieve for the dreams we once had for her: dreams of music, sport and a carefree childhood, all replaced by therapy sessions, hospital appointments and adaptions for survival.”</p> <p>She said the family was doing everything possible to show the girl that her life was “still full of possibilities” and to “make her smile”. “But the mental and emotional trauma we carry every day is heavy, a constant fear for her future and a constant grief for the life she lost and the life we imagined as a family,” she added.</p> <p>During a three-week trial, Riley was asked to identify the “third party” who had recruited him for about £40,000. He refused, citing fear for his life and for his family.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has offered up to £15,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person who fired the shots.</p> <p>DCI Joanna Yorke, who led the investigation, said: “The dangerous man responsible for pulling the trigger is walking free, and it is imperative we find him. People out there know what happened and are choosing to stay quiet. We understand that you may be worried about talking to us, but it is vital we hear from anyone who can assist this investigation.</p> <p>“Please reconsider your decision to stay silent and share what you know. Anything you say will be treated with the utmost care and confidentiality and you will be playing a huge part in securing justice for a young girl and her family.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Group opposing the proscription announces ‘major escalation’ that will culminate in London on 4 October</p>",
    "content": "<p>A<strong> </strong>week of mass actions protesting against the ban on Palestine Action has been announced, beginning at the Labour party conference in Liverpool and culminating in a national mobilisation in Parliament Square in London on 4 October.</p> <p>The plans were announced by Defend Our Juries on Friday, a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">857 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act</a> at a demonstration outside parliament opposing the proscription. It said the next phase of the protests represented a “major escalation” that would create an “unprecedented challenge” for the police, with 1,100 people already registered to take part and risk arrest.</p> <p>“There should be no confusion about where the blame lies: it sits squarely with the government for pursuing this authoritarian ban, plunging an overstretched police force and court and prison systems which are already in crisis, into further chaos,” a spokesperson said. “The power lies with the new home secretary to end this farce by listening to MPs, lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/yvette-cooper-plan-ban-palestine-action-un-experts-lawyers\">UN experts, legal professionals</a>, human rights advocates – and the majority of her own party’s members – and lift this dangerous, anti-democratic ban.”</p> <p>They accused the prime minister, Keir Starmer, of “grotesque double standards” for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/04/israel-president-visit-london-talks-ministers-isaac-herzog\">meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, this week</a>, while people had been arrested for holding cardboard signs in support of Palestine Action. They said it made people “even more determined to do whatever it takes to overturn this unjust ban, including by targeting Starmer’s upcoming conference”.</p> <p>Protests at the party conference, which begins on 28 September, will be an unwelcome distraction for the prime minister as he attempts to address Labour’s slump in the polls.</p> <p>Defend Our Juries launched a new call for people across the country to show their defiance by placing a sign saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” – the same wording people have brandished on placards at the demonstrations – in their front windows. It follows a viral video of a former Labour councillor, Keith Hackett, being <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/4e7ddf31-b481-4179-81f6-5af95e1633ff\">told by police</a> he could legally display a poster in support of Palestine Action because it was “not in public”.</p> <p>Last Saturday’s demonstration was the second major protest organised by Defend Our Juries in defiance of the ban. Defend Our Juries claimed there were 1,500 people holding signs saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” and that the police’s failure to arrest everyone showed they were overwhelmed.</p> <p>At the previous demonstration, last month, 532 people were arrested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/10/police-arrest-hundreds-london-protest-over-palestine-action-ban\">half of whom were aged 60 or above</a>. A spokesperson claimed opposition to the ban, the first of a direct action protest group, was “growing at an exponential rate”.</p> <p>The then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/yvette-cooper-vows-ban-palestine-action-anti-terrorism-laws\">announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action</a> in June, three days after it claimed responsibility for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, although it later emerged that she was advised to proscribe the group in March. She said the group, which targeted organisations it claimed were complicit in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians, had a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and was a threat to national security.</p> <p>Since the ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/04/ban-on-palestine-action-to-take-effect-after-legal-challenge-fails\">came into force on 5 July</a>, more than 1,600 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, including vicars, priests, doctors, former government advisers, army veterans, and many elderly and disabled people. The figure is more than were previously arrested during the entire “war on terror” <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-tact-2000-to-june-2025/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-and-subsequent-legislation-arrests-outcomes-and-stop-and-search-great-britain-quarterly-u\">since 2001</a>.</p> <p>Most have not been charged, although seven people appeared in court last week accused of being organisers of the demonstrations.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Trades Union Congress annual congress unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to repeal the proscription of Palestine Action.</p> <p>The president of the civil servants’ union said the ban represented a “significant abuse of counter-terrorist powers and a direct attack on our right to protest against the genocidal Israeli regime”.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dale Vince wants ministers to ‘optimise’ resources in fossil fuel basin to help smooth transition to renewables</p>",
    "content": "<p>One of Britain’s leading green industrialists has called on the government to offer subsidies to North Sea oil companies to help support a “just transition” to renewables that protects energy industry workers.</p> <p>Dale Vince, a Labour donor, urged ministers to “optimise” the remaining resources of the declining oil basin as the UK reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">banned new North Sea oil and gas projects</a>.</p> <p>The founder of Ecotricity spoke out a week after his fellow green entrepreneur Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/27/octopus-energy-founder-greg-jackson-given-cabinet-office-role-to-help-shape-future-policies\">a Cabinet Office adviser</a>, backed calls to restart North Sea drilling.</p> <p>The Labour party swept to power in 2024 with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/05/ban-on-new-drilling-confirmed-as-ministers-consult-on-north-sea-clean-energy-future\">halt new drilling licences in the North Sea</a>, and it plans to keep the windfall tax imposed during rocketing oil and gas prices in place until 2030.</p> <p>Vince said the government should scrap the windfall tax and instead offer subsidies to oil companies that guarantee a minimum price for the barrels of oil and gas they produce.</p> <p>“Our North Sea is in decline, let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left,” he said. “It’s time for Labour to put its arms around the North Sea and support operators with existing licences. Putting fossil fuels on an equal footing with renewables by giving them a stable price is the key to a just transition.”</p>    <p>Offshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea industry, declined to comment on whether Vince’s proposals would be welcomed by oil and gas companies. A government spokesperson said the proposal was “not under consideration. We are driving forward our mission to become a clean energy superpower, to cut bills for good.”</p> <p>They added: “We are delivering a fair and orderly transition in the North Sea to drive growth and secure tens of thousands of skilled jobs, with the biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first-of-a-kind carbon capture and storage clusters.”</p> <p>Jackson said last week that relying on North Sea oil and gas would have a smaller climate impact than relying on costly imports from the US and the Middle East, which release more emissions during production and transportation than homegrown fossil fuels.</p> <p>“When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas,” Jackson told the Telegraph. “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”</p> <p>The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there needed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist#:~:text=Fatih%20Birol%2C%20the%20IEA's%20executive,now%20%E2%80%93%20from%20this%20year.%E2%80%9D\">no new fossil fuel projects</a> if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>However, the global energy watchdog later clarified that continued investment in existing oil and gas supply would be “essential” in a net zero scenario to ensure that oil and gas supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand.</p> <p>The green industry leaders’ comments on the North Sea come amid growing pressure from opposition parties to back the industry, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">supports about 130,000 jobs</a> and contributed more than £6bn in tax receipts to the government in the last financial year and £9bn the year before.</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the party would aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/30/tories-would-maximise-north-sea-oil-and-gas-extraction-badenoch-expected-to-say\">to “maximise extraction”</a> of oil and gas in the North Sea if it won the next election. Reform UK has also promised to reverse Labour’s ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/23/reform-uk-promise-to-reverse-ban-on-north-sea-oil-drilling-if-elected\">as a “day one” priority</a> if it comes to power.</p> <p>The Guardian reported over the summer that senior government advisers had told North Sea investors that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/02/oil-and-gas-imports-are-a-problem-labour-should-rethink-its-north-sea-stance?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">new drilling could still move ahead</a> despite the election promise to ban it, provided the projects were close to existing pipeline infrastructure and did not extend into “greenfield” areas.</p> <p>“Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” one energy investor said.</p> <p>The source said that while Treasury officials were open to considering future North Sea oil and gas projects, the plans were unlikely to be well received by Ed Miliband, the secretary of state of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p> <p>Miliband reportedly refused to leave his post in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle last week. ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, who first reported the claims, said it was “one part of the reshuffle that didn’t quite go Starmer’s way”.</p> <p>• The headline and introductory text of this article were amended on 11 September 2025 to clarify what Dale Vince is urging the government to do. We regret that an earlier version said he was calling on the government “to allow new North Sea oil and gas projects”; in fact, he was calling for a guaranteed minimum price for the oil and gas produced by existing North Sea fields.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Prince and team from his Invictus Games Foundation were invited to Kyiv and will detail new initiatives to support wounded</p>",
    "content": "<p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/ukraine-amputee-veterans-disability-war-invasion-daniel-melnyk-marta-syrko\">military personnel who have been seriously injured</a> in the three-year war against Russia.</p> <p>During the trip to the Ukrainian capital, he and a team from his Invictus Games Foundation are set to detail new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded, with the eventual aim of providing help to all areas of the country.</p> <p>Earlier this year it was estimated that the Ukraine war had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/kyiv-league-of-the-mighty-how-amputee-football-supports-ukraine-survivors\">Kyiv’s League of the Mighty: how amputee football supports Ukraine’s survivors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian on an overnight train to the capital, the Duke of Sussex said: “We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.”</p> <p>He added: “We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”</p>    <p>The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded amputees. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/10/prince-harry-makes-unannounced-visit-to-wounded-veterans-in-ukraine\">visited the centre in April</a>, but met her by chance a couple of months ago in the US.</p> <p>“I bumped into Olga in New York. It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said ‘the biggest impact you have is coming to Kyiv’. I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.</p> <p>“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”</p> <p>Ukraine first took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/invictus-games\">Invictus Games</a> in 2017, but enthusiasm and need for the competition, which was founded by the Prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.</p> <p>The Duke remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.</p>    <p>“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out. Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield. It means so much to us, because it means so much to them.”</p> <p>During the trip, the Prince is due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He is expected to spend time with 200 veterans, who have also been invited. He is also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.</p> <p>Travelling to Kyiv would give him a chance to talk to veterans, and also see some of the destruction first-hand, he said. While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.</p> <p>Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become “a key function in veterans’ healthcare.</p> <p>“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy.”</p> <p>By March this year, more than 22,000 veterans across Ukraine had accessed benefits like gym memberships and pool passes.</p> <p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Bride finally tracks down awkward-looking stranger she and husband noticed only when looking through photos</p>",
    "content": "<p>A baffled bride has solved the mystery of the awkward-looking stranger who crashed her wedding four years ago.</p> <p>Michelle Wylie and her husband, John, registered the presence of their unidentifiable guest only as they looked through photographs of their wedding in the days after the happy occasion.</p> <p>Who was the tall man in a dark suit, distinguished by the look of quiet mortification on his face? But their family and friends could offer no explanation, nor could hotel staff at the Carlton hotel in Prestwick, where the event took place in November 2021. An appeal on Facebook likewise yielded no clues.</p> <p>Eventually, with the mystery still niggling, Wylie asked the popular Scottish content creator Dazza to cast the online net wider – and a sheepish Andrew Hillhouse finally stepped forward.</p> <p>In his explanatory post on Facebook, Hillhouse admitted that he had been “cutting it fine, as I’m known to do” when he pulled up at the wedding venue with five minutes to spare. Spotting a piper and other guests, he followed them into the hotel – “I remember thinking to myself: ‘Cool, this is obviously the right place’” – unaware that he had the address completely wrong and was supposed to be at a ceremony 2 miles away in Ayr.</p>    <p>He was initially unperturbed to find himself surrounded by strangers as the ceremony began – at the marriage he was due to attend, the only person he knew was the bride, Michaela, while his partner, Andrew, was part of the wedding party. It was when an entirely different bride came walking down the aisle that he realised: “OMG that’s not Michaela … I was at the wrong wedding!”</p> <p>Hillhouse said: “You can’t exactly stand up and walk out of a wedding mid-ceremony, so I just had to commit to this act and spent the next 20 minutes awkwardly sitting there trying to be as inconspicuous as my 6ft 2 ass could be.”</p> <p>At the end of the ceremony, Hillhouse, who is from Troon, was hoping to make a discreet exit, only to be waylaid by the wedding photographer, who insisted he join other guests for a group shot.

    "content": "<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p> <p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p> <p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\" data-alt=\"a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile.</p> <p>The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further.</p> <p>“Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.”</p> <p>The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London.</p> <p>Business groups have blamed Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution</a>, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business.</p> <p>Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade.</p> <p>“The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.”</p> <p>The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.</p> <p>However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence.</p> <p>Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.”</p> <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on.</p> <p>“Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.”</p> <p>Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed.</p> <p>The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">jumped to 3.8% in July</a>, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.</p> <p>Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.</p>",

Inland areas will also experience stormy weather, with most of England and Wales experiencing 45mph to 55mph gusts.</p> <p>Delays to transport are likely, along with a slight risk of injuries and danger to life from flying debris, the forecaster added.</p> <p>Stephen Kocher, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said that from Sunday, strong west or southwesterly winds would arrive at coastal areas in south-west England and Wales then spread inland.</p> <p>The Met Office said the weather had been caused by a deepening area of low pressure travelling eastwards across the Atlantic.</p> <p>While there has been speculation that the weekend’s weather will bring the first named storm of the season – expected to be Storm Amy – the Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said on Friday that there was currently no plan to name the storm.</p> <p>“Obviously we are in meteorological autumn now; it’s the sort of weather that we do expect at this time of year,” he said. “So it’s nothing unusual, particularly – perhaps it’s just the contrast with the weather that we have enjoyed over most of the summer.”</p> <p>The Met Office has advised those in the alert area to prepare by protecting their property, including securing loose outdoor items such as bins, sheds, fences and garden furniture.</p> <p>There will be a brief reprieve from the intense weather on Tuesday but Madge warned that more severe gales could hit exposed coastal areas again on Wednesday. He said it was too early to tell where the impact would be but that it would be less severe than the winds arriving on Sunday.</p> <p>“Drivers are really going to feel the effects of the early autumnal weather this weekend,” said Rod Dennis, a spokesperson for the RAC breakdown service.</p> <p>“This will particularly be the case later on Sunday and into the new working week – strong gusty winds will make driving conditions challenging across a large swathe of southern and western Britain.</p> <p>“The wind will be particularly noticeable on more exposed roads, like those over the moors in Devon and Cornwall, so drivers may like to delay their journeys or seek other routes.</p> <p>“We urge anyone setting out to reduce their speeds while driving and pass high-sided vehicles with particular care.”</p> <p>Sunshine and drier conditions are most likely to be found in the east, though temperatures will remain on the cooler side, with highs of about 17C to 18C expected in London on Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/mps-asda-app-loans-wagestream",
    "description": "<p>Exclusive: Retailer’s owner has stake in Wagestream, which offers workers loans of up to £25,000</p>",
    "content": "<p>An influential group of MPs has sought assurances that Asda is not “squeezing staff” to drive profit after it emerged they are being offered high-interest loans by Wagestream, a company in which the retailer’s owner has a stake.</p> <p>The business and trade select committee has written to Asda over its links to the “financial wellbeing app” that recently began offering the supermarket’s staff loans of up to £25,000. The default arrangements for Wagestream’s “workplace loans” involve debt repayments being directly deducted from workers’ pay packets.</p> <p> A holding company controlled by Asda’s private equity owner TDR Capital is a shareholder in Wagestream, which has been offering Asda workers a range of other services, including savings pots and wage advances, since 2023.</p> <p>Documents filed at Companies House show that the holding company, Bellis Financial Investments 2, is one of a number of shareholders in Wagestream, alongside former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital, and social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund.</p> <p>However, the Guardian understands that the retailer did not flag its financial link to Wagestream to staff when it initially launched the service to workers two years ago. Wagestream – which this week rebranded itself as Stream – started offering “workplace loans” to Asda staff earlier this year.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade committee, said he had written to Asda “to ask them to reassure us that frontline workers aren’t left facing sky-high interest rates, and that its workplace lending is compliant with Asda’s legal requirements under employment law”.</p> <p>“Asda is one of Britain’s most important employers with over 150,000 workers and is at the heart of our grocery market,” he said. </p> <p>“Our concern today is that instead of easing Asda’s debts, its parent company may<strong> </strong>be piling pressure on Asda’s people – squeezing staff to service liabilities and drive profit to its financial investments. If this is the case, it raises serious questions as to Asda’s responsible stewardship, and the long-term financial sustainability of the business as a whole.”</p> <p>Asda’s finance director, Michael Gleeson, told the committee in 2023 that a £100m investment in Wagestream and two other financial services businesses had been funded out of proceeds from the £1.7bn sale of Asda’s warehouses, which the company now has to pay rent on under a leaseback deal. “We are part owners of each of those three companies,” he told MPs. Bellis is understood to hold a 4% stake in Wagestream.</p> <p>Asda said it does not pay Wagestream for any services or receive any financial benefit if a member of staff chooses to use the app. However, as a shareholder, Asda’s parent group has a direct interest in its success and would have the right to a share of any future dividend payments or proceeds from the sale of the group.</p> <p>Wagestream is yet to pay a dividend and remains loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in 2024.</p> <p>That could change before long, however, with revenues having grown by more than two-thirds (64%) to £36.9m last year, when it handed out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn.</p> <p>The rollout of workplace loans could propel earnings, which have so far relied on fees linked to its wage advance product. Wagestream said a rise in revenues in the upcoming year would probably outpace costs and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Asda, which is the UK’s third largest supermarket, said: “Asda offers colleagues access to a range of established financial products through a partner regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These include salary advances, workplace loans and savings products paying a competitive interest rate of 4.33%, which is currently used by more than 18,000 colleagues.</p> <p>“Many other large employers, including all of Asda’s direct competitors in the grocery sector, offer similar products to their employees through the same or competitor providers.”</p> <p>Asda added that all applications for Wagestream’s workplace loans were subject to “robust affordability checks” before being approved. “At present, fewer than 2% of Asda colleagues have taken out a loan. The representative APR on these loans is 13.9%.”</p> <p>Wagestream began rolling out the loans to clients including Asda at the end of 2024. Those loans come with a representative APR of between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.</p> <p>But the ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its model still saves borrowers an average of £593 a loan, with customers having been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the app.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said it was concerned about the financial links between Asda and Wagestream: “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that TDR has a financial interest in the app that facilitates Asda workers taking these financial risks, while also being the overall decision-maker for how much these workers are paid and the hours they are able to work.”</p> <p>“We now find out that Wagestream is offering dangerous loans at high interest rates and GMB members working in Asda tell us they have used the app to take advances on their pay, which can contribute to a cycle of debt.</p> <p>“The bottom line is that employers should pay workers enough to live on, to have savings and to not need to rely on dangerous high-interest loans or advances on their pay just to cover day-to-day living costs.”</p> <p>Wagestream said in a statement that “as a regulated financial services provider, Wagestream has a conflicts of interest policy and has implemented processes to review and monitor conflicts of interest to comply with FCA rules.”</p> <p>“TDR Capital’s holding in Wagestream does not create a conflict as it falls well below the thresholds set out by the FCA. As a minority shareholder, TDR Capital does not have operational or day-to-day control of any of Wagestream’s undertakings,” the statement added.</p> <p>Wagestream said it considers potential conflicts when deciding on whether to partner with employers, which in turn sign its terms and conditions that require good consumer outcomes and transparency, including around fees.</p> <p>TDR declined to comment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It was left to a – albeit extinct – tiny relative of the kangaroo to offer some relief from the blizzard of major events</p>",
    "content": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Where to start in a week so fraught with major events you could hardly draw breath for the news flashes? It started with Trump’s alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book,” shared by the Democrats on social media on Monday and leading to the discovery of a name not widely recognised in the US but of intense interest in the UK – Peter Mandelson. The British ambassador to the US had proffered an undiplomatically warm birthday message to the late child sex offender financier, starting a press scramble that ended, on Thursday, with Keir Starmer firing him.</p> <p>That was just the beginning. As Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Nato jets, forecasts of a third world war gained pace and in the US, Charlie Kirk, a rightwing political activist, was assassinated in front of a crowd in Utah. Another firing followed: at MSNBC, the analyst Matthew Dowd was swiftly booted for suggesting that Kirk, who had a history of making racist and sexist remarks, had learned the hard way that, “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”. On the Christian right, meanwhile, Kirk instantly rose to the status of an American martyr.</p> <p>If it was a week in which America looked, once again, like an increasingly dysfunctional and unhappy place and Europe slid towards darker days, it was left to Australia to cheer us, which it did with – what else? – the discovery of a new marsupial: a tiny, previously unknown relative of the kangaroo, a sort of mouse-wallaby hybrid species of “bettong”, identified by its fossil remains because, in keeping with the general state of the world and because we can’t have nice things, it turns out it is already extinct.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Also extinct (almost): that species of lovable eccentric billionaire who stays out of politics and spends his cash on decommissioned Soviet fighter jets and a luxury car collection. In other words, Larry Ellison, the 90s playboy and founder of Oracle with the lustrous, tan-coloured mane to make Elon Musk weep. At the turn of the millennium Ellison was the world’s richest man, long since eclipsed by the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos, but like all things from the 90s he’s back with a vengeance and this week, after Oracle’s stock price soared, once again took the top spot.</p> <p>Per the business pages, Oracle’s shares soared owing to a “rosy outlook for [the company’s] cloud infrastructure business and AI deals”. I’m more interested in revisiting the greatest hits of a billionaire whose biographer, Mike Wilson, once described as “a one-man amusement park, Larryland.” To wit: Ellison flying his Marchetti S.211 fighter plane in mock dog fights over the Pacific with his son, David; winning the Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 with a young Lachlan Murdoch onboard; and my favourite Ellison flourish, what was said to be his favourite chat-up line of the 90s – “Can I buy you a car?”</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>More news from Australia that is almost as charming as a marsupial: Russell Crowe (I know, he’s originally from New Zealand), gussied up in a Nazi uniform and gone the full Brando in the trailer for Nuremberg. Crowe plays Hermann Göring, who at the time of his capture apparently weighed 280 pounds and was described by an allied soldier who witnessed it as a “huge bulk”, an acting challenge to which Crowe appears to have magnificently risen. The forthcoming movie co-stars Rami Malek, Michael Shannon and Leo Woodall, but clearly this is Rusty’s picture. His German accent – “I vill have, as you say, my day I court” – is worth the ticket price alone and appears to be a combo of ‘Allo ‘Allo!’s Gestapo corps and, as Crowe once said of his accent in Gladiator, “Royal Shakespeare Company three pints after lunch.” Bravo!</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The huge bulk of Emily’s saggy old cat, Bagpuss, is coming back in a new film to make gen X cry. For those not born in the 20th century, Bagpuss was an old cloth cat with pink stripes and piercing blue eyes, who lived in a shop for lost and found items with his friends Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the doll and the mice on the mouse organ (“Heave! Heave!). News of the reboot this week sent me straight to YouTube to watch the opening sequence of Oliver Postgate’s TV show, broadcast in the mid- to late-70s on repeat and almost unbearably poignant, not least because it’s narrated in an accent that no longer exists.</p> <p>Bagpuss (“The most important, the most beautiful, the most magical, saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world”) is embedded in the earliest TV memories of those of us who were kids at the time and, having a moment at my screen, I called over my 10-year-old to share in the magic. She watched for 20 seconds, said, “Boring!”, patted me sympathetically on the arm and walked off. “Baggy and a bit loose at the seams,” I murmured in unison with Postgate, “but Emily loved him.”</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Prince Harry met the king in London this week after an apparent estrangement of 19 months and, according to those monitoring the arrival and departure of the prince’s car, the audience lasted 54 minutes. But that’s a generous interpretation of the actual face time involved in the “private tea”, which, allowing for entrance and egress through Clarence House, settling in and waiting time, surely came out closer to half an hour. Did Harry whip out his phone and show his father photos of the two grandchildren he’s spent almost no time with? Did the king ask about Meghan? Was it all about money? Was there ever a more pitiful sight than, generation after generation, the royal family’s cold and strained filial relations?</p>",

This increase was driven primarily by the services and construction sectors, but production output fell by 1.3%. However, growth is slowing in these sectors and is likely the result of actions taken by the Labour government now being realised, with the increase in employer national insurance contributions having a significant impact on business confidence. </p> <p>“With the summer now over and the economy supposedly getting out of its slumber, we now face continuing uncertainty in the lead up to the budget in November given the precarious position the Chancellor finds the public finances in. It is estimated that the fiscal hole that needs to be plugged is anywhere between £20bn and £50bn. While that is a wide range, it means one thing for a government that has shown it will struggle to cut spending – more tax rises. </p> <p>“Speculation is already rife about which taxes will be raised, and without the ability to raise the main revenue generators – income tax, national insurance and VAT – the government is left with targeting multiple sectors for small amounts of revenue.

    "content": "<p>The chief executive of Barclays has said the UK government needs to limit pay rises for public sector workers and resist a further “squeeze” on banks with tax increases.</p> <p>CS Venkatakrishnan said the government needed to look at its own spending levels as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seeks ways to address a fiscal hole when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">announces her budget in November</a>.</p> <p>“We need to curb expenditure at the government level,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8589b6ec-1c3b-4c1d-8352-8664325bf698\">told the Financial Times</a>. “We need to find a way to curb wage inflation.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishnan said that while the government needed to restrict rising “public sector” wages, the inflationary impact of pay rises was an issue across the UK economy.</p> <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said Venkatakrishnan had a “brass neck” calling for pay rise curbs when his pay packet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/barclays-profit-rise-ceo-cs-venkatakrishnan-more-pay\">doubled to £10.5m last year</a>, the highest for a Barclays boss since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-pay\">Bob Diamond received £17m in 2011.</a></p> <p>“It is frankly insulting for him to call on nurses, teachers and paramedics to tighten their belts when he’s just pocketed a bumper pay rise,” said Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>“Instead of talking down public sector workers, those with the broader shoulders – including the mega-wealthy like CS Venkatakrishnan, banks and gambling companies – should contribute their fair share to funding our schools, hospitals and local authorities.”</p> <p>While UK wage growth has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/the-uk-labour-market-is-cooling-but-this-is-a-slowdown-not-a-collapse\">slowed in recent months</a>, it is still running at an annual rate of 5.7% in the public sector, excluding bonuses. Private sector wage growth is running at an average of 4.8%.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: “Someone happily accepting a pay package of £10.5m doesn’t really have the moral authority to tell nurses and teachers and local government workers they shouldn’t get a pay rise.</p> <p>“It would be a lot easier to fund decent wages for public sector workers if the wealth of multimillionaires was taxed more effectively, so if the Barclays CEO is concerned about the sustainability of public finances, he would look a lot less crass and hypocritical if he used his position to argue for a wealth tax on the super-rich instead.” </p> <p>Venkatakrishnan also said the banking sector should not be a target of further taxation. “UK banks are taxed more than banks anywhere else,” he said. “How much more are you going to squeeze this?”</p> <p>Banks are concerned that the industry’s reliable profits, fuelled by higher interest rates, could make it one of the targets for tax increases as Reeves comes under pressure to raise taxes to address a hole in her fiscal plans.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/29/uk-bank-shares-tumble-after-call-for-windfall-tax-on-lenders-in-budget\">UK bank shares tumbled</a>, cutting the combined market value of some of the biggest companies in the sector by more than £6bn, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the budget spooked investors.</p> <p>“I hope it’s an extremely low possibility,” said Venkatakrishnan. “London is a great global financial centre and the path to growth does not lie to taxing the sector even more. I have had the view from day one that this is a government that is pro business and particularly pro the financial industry.”</p> <p>He claimed the UK banks had, in effect, a total tax rate of about 46% last year, compared with 28% in New York and 29% to 39% in the EU.</p> <p>Barclays made £5.7bn in pre-tax profits last year in the UK, and paid almost £1.4bn in total tax. Of this, £198m was corporation tax and £154m for the bank levy.</p> <p>“What I hope and expect is that they will take this time to think through the difficult choices they have to make,” Venkatakrishnan said. “No budget keeps everyone happy, but the object of it is to foster growth in the country.”</p> <p>Venkatakrishan has been a vocal supporter of Reeves and the wider Labour government’s policies since it took power last summer, but has recently spoken out against proposals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/13/uk-bank-ringfencing-deregulation-financial-services-rachel-reeves\">change ringfencing rules</a> that force UK banks to separate their retail and riskier investment banking operations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former White House adviser turns spotlight on ‘resilient’ region with new podcast Forged in the North</p>",
    "content": "<p>There is a “resilience and grit” that comes from being born in the north-east of England, says Fiona Hill, who went from a working-class childhood in County Durham to a top intelligence job at the heart of the White House.</p> <p>But, she believes, it is also a big reason why she and other notable high achievers have had the success they have. The secret of success could be being from the north-east.</p> <p>Hill has talked to a number of figures from – or with strong links to – the north-east for her new Forged in the North podcast series, which will be launched at <a href=\"https://newwritingnorth.com/event/fiona-hill-forged-in-the-north/\">Durham book festival in October</a>.</p> <p>They include two global figures originally from the same part of Wallsend: the Cramlington primary school teacher turned superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/22/the-last-ship-review-sting\">Sting</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/05/academicexperts.highereducationprofile\">the Yale historian Paul Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>“It’s basically just listening to two people who seem on the surface so completely different but have this common origin story,” says Hill.</p> <p>Other podcast guests are Lee Hall, the writer of Billy Elliot; Brendan Foster, the founder of the Great North Run; the north-east mayor, Kim McGuinness; the Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Sara Davies; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/03/oscar-conclave-peter-straughan-best-adapted-screenplay\">dramatist Peter Straughan</a>; and the Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p>Hill was born and brought up in Bishop Auckland, the daughter of a coalminer and a midwife. She and her accent went on to be a foreign affairs adviser to US presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump and she is considered one of the world’s leading experts on Russia and Putin.</p> <p>Last year she was named as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/19/labour-defence-adviser-fiona-hill\">three advisers to oversee the UK government’s strategic defence review</a>.</p> <p>The new series is born, Hill says, of a belief that “too much happens down in London, as if the rest of the country doesn’t exist”.</p> <p>The hope is to “put the spotlight on a region that is normally only in the headlines for something going wrong: child poverty, the lowest life expectancy, worst nutrition”, she says.</p> <p>“The north-east is home of the Industrial Revolution – literally the engines of prosperity. Two hundred years ago, it was the forefront of innovation, and we’re saying, there’s still a lot of potential for innovation.”</p> <p>Hill turns 60 this year and is planning a trip back to the north-east from her home in the US. She says: “I’ve always wanted to walk along a portion of Hadrian’s Wall, I want to go back up the Northumberland coast. I want to come back for all the stories and storytelling I remember as a kid from the region.”</p> <p>It was in this context that the idea of the podcast series came about, with the aim of telling stories about the north “not just how it was, but how it is and how it might be”.</p> <p>Many cultural figures have talked passionately about the importance of where they are from. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/bbc-to-be-unashamedly-hull-centric-during-city-year-in-cultural-spotlight\">Hull-born playwright Richard Bean once said</a>: “Thank God I wasn’t born in Guildford. Thank God I was born somewhere there is tragedy and comedy every other second.”</p> <p>Hill says coming from the north-east gives “a certain resilience and grit”. “Being from the north-east grounds you, it’s an anchor, a solid base with a strong sense of what’s right and wrong and a clear perspective and values.”</p> <p>She points to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52269-how-strong-are-regional-identities-in-britain\">a recent poll</a> revealing how people from the north-east have a stronger attachment to their region than other parts of England. “There’s a sense of solidarity that’s been forged in adversity. Everyone’s thrown all kinds of rubbish at the north historically … but it has a resilience.”</p> <p>The importance of investing in people while they are young is a theme of the podcast discussions, says Hill, who got a grant from the Durham Miners’ Association to take a Russian language course to pursue her ambition to go to university.</p> <p>Straughan and Hall got started with enterprise grants and through locally funded theatres. Interestingly, McGuinness and Davies, both younger interviewees, say they had to make their own luck, with Davies using her savings to start her successful business.</p> <p>McGuinness says the series resonated with her ambition for the north-east to be a cultural powerhouse. “This important podcast shines a light on how with the right support, talent can truly thrive.</p> <p>“Funding in our region’s art sector has been outpaced by the south for some time. I’m determined to fix that cultural chasm and the cycle of regional inequality, positioning the north-east as a strong contender in the UK economy.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Compare and contrast. Here is the opening line in the government’s response to news that the US pharmaceutical company Merck is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">scrapping its £1bn research centre</a> in King’s Cross in London because it thinks the UK is not an internationally competitive venue. Whistling cheerfully, the Department for Science, Technology and Innovation managed to claim: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world.”</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/big-pharma-will-halt-investments-in-uk-warns-eminent-scientist-sir-john-bell\">here is Sir John Bell</a>, former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and all-round grand guru of life sciences in the UK. He told Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.</p> <p>Who to believe? Frankly, the government’s boast is absurd. As anybody who follows the pharma sector knows, the big multinational firms are all obsessing over precisely the issues identified by Bell.</p> <p>The first is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">the amount of money the UK spends on medicines</a>: 9% of its healthcare budget, versus 17% in Germany and Italy and 15% in France. The second is the “clawback” mechanism that caps the NHS’s spending on prescription medicines. The formula last year spat out a figure of 23% to be recouped from firms, whereas equivalent European schemes tend to be in single digits. Such out-of-line ratios deter investment, goes the industry’s argument.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">What is the row between Wes Streeting and pharmaceutical companies about?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One possible reaction is to say big pharma makes big profits and the government is only doing its job if it tries to drive a hard bargain on drug prices. Another is to point out that the UK still has excellent long-term research and development infrastructure – world-class labs, universities, pots of public money for manufacturing – that even the most commercially minded pharma company ought to view separately from a quarrel over the price the NHS pays for medicines.</p> <p>Sadly, real life is not so simple. The Trump factor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/aug/27/tough-talk-from-streeting-but-he-still-needs-a-deal-with-big-pharma\">as described in this column</a> a couple of weeks ago, has changed the dynamic. The president is demanding that US drug prices fall towards European levels; thus the companies do not want the UK, which has traditionally been able to force some of the lowest prices among rich European countries, to be used as a reference point. One can accuse the drugmakers of being ruthless or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">shortsighted</a>, but the cold reality is that they choose where to invest. The Merck example suggests that the mood is genuinely hardening.</p> <p>The company is not a fly-by-night operator. It has been in the UK for almost a century and is a big commercial presence in the Francis Crick Institute, one of those pieces of valuable infrastructure that, supposedly, was meant to tie firms into the UK. Government ministers comforted themselves that Merck is keeping 1,600 jobs in the UK and will continue to run clinical trials here. But the lifeblood of the life sciences is new investment. Merck is pulling the plug on a building that is half-built; other companies’ investments that, invisibly, don’t happen are just as damaging over time.</p> <p>As previously argued, one can sympathise with Wes Streeting, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer\">who walked away from price negotiations</a> by the pharma trade body last month. He inherited tensions that are a decade old and the new US factor has raised the stakes massively. Then there is the complication of official “value for money” criteria for new medicines that have not changed since 2001 (the industry’s other big complaint). The backdrop is the Treasury’s budget constraints. There is no easy answer.</p> <p>But a good first step would be to stop officials making silly statements about the UK being the best place in the world to invest. Yes, there are underlying strengths – the ministerial pitch about the UK becoming “a life sciences superpower” isn’t completely dreamy. But Bell is right when he says “without large companies, it isn’t going to work”. At the moment, it isn’t working.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from Rachel Reeves.</p> <p>Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job.</p> <p>The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">Growth flatlined in July</a>, slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year.</p> <p>Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers.</p> <p>Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/retail-sales-rise-but-ons-apologises-as-statistics-crisis-deepens\">decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025</a> women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services.</p> <p>The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds.</p> <p>Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment.</p> <p>As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances.</p> <p>Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/uk-hit-by-fresh-sell-off-in-government-bond-markets-as-pound-weakens\">Bond market investors</a> are watching closely.</p> <p>Among the big concerns is that speculation over the tax changes in the budget will dampen business activity over the coming months, even before November arrives, in a carbon copy of Labour’s first months back in office last year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power.</p> <p>On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/29/imf-global-growth-forecast-trump-tariffs-eu-trade-us\">International Monetary Fund</a> – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges.</p> <p>Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Up to 400 large shops are at risk of closure with as many as 100,000 jobs at risk if the government goes ahead with plans to hit stores with higher business rates, retailers have warned.</p> <p>Some of the UK’s largest retail premises, including supermarkets and department stores, would face higher property tax charges under new rules being considered by the government before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases\">November’s budget</a>.</p> <p>The higher charges for larger sites, including warehouses, offices and other premises, are intended to pay for discounts for smaller business properties, such as independent retailers, cafes and pubs, after the Labour government pledged to make the business rates system fairer.</p> <p>The bosses of big retailers including John Lewis, Lidl and B&amp;Q met the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, last week to ask her to exclude retail from the surcharge.</p> <p>The new rules are targeted at all business premises with a rateable value – a figure linked to rents – of more than £500,000. The surcharge could apply to 4,000 large retail outlets, according to the British Retail Consortium, which represents most large retail groups.</p> <p>The BRC looked at how a similar level of increased costs had affected retail businesses in the past to estimate how many of sites might be forced to close under the planned tax change. It concluded that 400 big stores could close. It said retailers might also raise prices or cut jobs in order to protect their profits.</p> <p>Some of the potentially affected retail outlets are so-called anchor tenants, big retailers that play a key role in attracting visitors to high streets and shopping centres, and driving trade to nearby cafes, pubs and other retailers.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Britain’s largest shops are magnets, pulling people into high streets, shopping centres and retail parks, supporting thousands of surrounding cafes, restaurants and smaller and independent shops. After years of rising costs, far too many stores have disappeared – leaving behind empty shells that once thrived at the heart of our communities.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/sep/11/pre-budget-howls-from-big-business-beasts-go-deeper-than-the-usual-tax-grumbles\">Pre-budget howls from big business beasts go deeper than the usual tax grumbles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reeves wrote to ministers this week, saying: “We want to see thriving high streets and small businesses investing in their future, not held back by outdated rules or strangled by red tape.</p> <p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck. That’s why growth is our number one mission.”</p> <p>The chancellor indicated that the government was considering changes to business rates to tackle so called “cliff edges”, which can lead to a leap in taxes when a small business wants to expand.</p> <p>Her comments accompanied an interim report on government plans for business rate changes, published on Thursday, which included changing the way rates were calculated and improving support for investment in premises.</p> <p>Kate Nicholls, the chair of the UKHospitality, which represents thousands of restaurants, pubs and cafes, said: “For too long, the broken business rates system has unfairly punished hospitality businesses and I’m pleased that the government is taking action to reform it.</p> <p>“These measures to remove punitive cliff-edges and barriers to investment are positive and will help to rebalance the system, as will the government’s commitment to lower business rates bills for hospitality businesses.”</p>",

He has this gorgeous velvet cape with a jewelled trim and he’s wearing a Spanish real, a coin, around his neck, and this metal gorget [covering the throat], which glints.</p> <p>“I think spending time dwelling on those details is really rewarding and there’s also this amazing unknowable quality about his face. He’s almost holding something back. I think it’s a fun one for people to engage with it because they’re meeting Rembrandt so there’s a sense of direct interaction.”</p> <p>The average museum or gallery visitor <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/guide-slow-looking\">is said to spend just eight seconds looking at each artwork</a>.</p> <p>“People want to feel like they’ve seen everything,” Orrock said. “What we’re doing is trying to provide lots of different ways into the picture.”</p>    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/nature/how-walking-in-nature-can-help-wellbeing\">the mental health benefits of being in nature are widely known</a>, the expectation is that drinking in the Rembrandt will offer similar restorative effects.</p> <p>“We’re hoping it will provide that sort of escape from reality and that moment to have a bit of time out,” said Orrock. “It’s about giving people permission to stop and look – people can relax for as long as they like with the picture.”</p> <p>The tour, Meet Rembrandt: A Slow Looking Experience, starts at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/dorset/kingston-lacy\">Kingston Lacy, Dorset</a>, on Friday before heading to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/dunham-massey\">Dunham Massey in Cheshire</a> in March 2026 and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/warwickshire/upton-house-and-gardens\">Upton House in Warwickshire</a> in July next year.</p> <p>Visitors will have the option to explore the painting’s history through audio guides featuring insights from conservators, art historians, and even imagined reflections from Rembrandt himself.</p> <p>But one of the guide’s channels will be devoted to a “slow looking guided meditation”. Orrock said: “There’s a gong and a soothing voice. You’re encouraged to think about your physical state while you’re looking at the picture, things like putting both feet on the floor, taking a deep breath, just letting your eyes travel over the painting. There’s not a right or wrong thing to see – it’s just about allowing yourself that time with the picture and seeing what comes out for you.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Official log refers to Wafic Saïd, a Canadian billionaire whose British wife has given millions to party, as ‘donor’</p>",
    "content": "<p>The Conservative party is facing questions over a possible breach of electoral law involving one of its largest benefactors, after leaked files cast doubt on official declarations of donations worth £2.6m.</p> \n<p>More than 40 donations to the Tories over 23 years have been registered in the name of Rosemary Saïd, a British woman.</p> \n<p>But leaked documents marked “official – sensitive”, seen by the Guardian, renew long-running questions about whether it is her husband, the billionaire businessman Wafic Saïd, who is the real source of the money even though he is barred by electoral law from donating.</p> \n<p>One of the documents, an official government log from Boris Johnson’s time in Downing Street, contains the entry: “Political meeting with Wafic Said (donor) and Rosemary Said.”</p> \n<p>Wafic also had two separate phone calls with Johnson and senior aides without his wife, according to other logs.</p> \n<p>A Canadian citizen resident in Monaco, Wafic, 85, is barred by law from donating because he is not eligible to vote in the UK. Rosemary, 79, is allowed to give money and the Conservative party has declared donations in her name between 2001 and 2024. Johnson declared a £10,000 contribution from her during his leadership campaign.</p> \n<p>When contacted for comment, Wafic Saïd said: “My wife is an independently wealthy woman who has been a strong supporter of the Conservative party her entire life.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I have not made donations to the Conservative party for at least 25 years, and any suggestion otherwise would be clearly untrue and would be a very serious matter for me, as I always respect the law.”</p> \n<p>A Conservative party spokesperson said it carried out “proper due diligence” on the donations and added: “We do not comment on purported leaked documents, which may have been obtained or manipulated by hostile states.”</p> \n<p>The files were obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked and hacked documents. DDoS has said it does not know the provenance of the data. The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files have been doctored.</p> \n<h2>Rise to prominence</h2> \n<p>Born in Damascus, Wafic came to Britain in the 1960s and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/29/business.politics\">ran a restaurant</a> in west London. He rose to prominence as a fixer for Saudi royals, playing a role in arms sales from the UK to the kingdom.</p> \n<p>He gave money – reportedly £300,000 – to the Tories in the 1990s but stopped after scandals over foreign donations led to them being banned. From 2001, the Conservatives began to declare donations in Rosemary’s name.</p> \n<p>The leaked file showing that it was Wafic – rather than Rosemary – who was described as a donor appears in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">trove of documents</a> from Boris Johnson’s private office obtained by DDoS and seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The documents contain logs recorded by civil servants that keep a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities.</p> \n<p>The entry identifying Wafic as the donor was made on 12 September 2019, over<strong> </strong>a month into Johnson’s premiership. It says he and two top aides spent an hour and a half with the Saïds.</p> \n<p>Although the log entry is not a formal statement of a donor’s identity, other records show Wafic enjoyed the kind of privileged access to a prime minister typically granted to donors, rather than merely a donor’s spouse.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In June 2020, as the Covid pandemic raged, Johnson found half an hour for what the official log records as “political phone calls”, meaning Tory party matters rather than affairs of state. He was joined by Ben Elliot, the fellow Old Etonian whom Johnson had appointed party chair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/27/can-i-now-send-the-funds-secrets-of-the-conservative-money-machine\">turbocharge fundraising</a>, on a call to Wafic. It appears to have been followed by a call with a major donor.</p> \n<p>In March 2021, on a train journey from Stoke-on-Trent to London, Johnson made a quick call to another donor and then phoned Wafic again.</p> \n<p>Other “political” meetings and phone calls recorded in the logs were between Johnson and Conservative party donors, ministers, staff or advisers.</p> \n<p>There is no record of Rosemary being on the calls with Wafic and she is not named in the logs – which cover all but two months of Johnson’s time in No 10 – apart from on the Downing Street meeting she attended with Wafic.</p> \n<p>Wafic said: “At my age, I do not recall these conversations. However, it is entirely possible that he [Johnson] may have called to thank me for my contribution to Covid vaccine research.” In 2020, Wafic <a href=\"https://www.development.ox.ac.uk/news/oxfords-vaccine-research-and-development-boosted-by-donation-from-wafic-said\">gave £3m to the University of Oxford</a> to fund that work.</p> \n<p>Steve Goodrich, the head of research at Transparency International UK and a former Electoral Commission senior policy adviser, said “credible allegations of rule breaking” should be investigated.</p> \n<p>“Electoral law is crystal clear that parties and politicians can only accept donations from permissible sources, and recipients must verify the source of funds,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Conservative party spokesperson said it “only accepts permissible donors as set out in law. Proper due diligence was undertaken to ensure that these donations were permissible and accurately reported. Other individuals can support a political party without being a donor.”</p> \n<p>Wafic also said he had known Johnson since “long before he became prime minister”.</p> \n<p>Approached for comment, Johnson did not respond to specific questions about the donations. He likened the Guardian’s coverage of the leaked files to Soviet propaganda.</p> \n<h2>‘True friend and admirer’</h2> \n<p>The files also contain a copy of a letter Wafic wrote to Johnson when he resigned as prime minister. He said it had been “emotional” watching Johnson’s final speech from the dispatch box and he commended him on a “legacy to be proud of”.</p> \n<p>“I really enjoyed all the meetings we had, whether in person or via Zoom,” Wafic went on. “I hope that now you are free of the burdens of high office, we will be able to see you more often. I also hope that you realise that in me you have a true friend and admirer. Rosemary joins me in sending you and all your family our warmest wishes and fond affection.”</p> \n<p>Johnson replied: “I am proud of my time in office although there is of course much more I would have liked to achieve given the opportunity. I am grateful for your ongoing support and friendship.” He added: “Please send my best to Rosemary, and I look forward to seeing you soon.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Fraud using AI cost the US $12.3bn in 2023 and <a href=\"https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime#:~:text=The%20banking%20sector%20is%20expecting,from%20%2412.3bn%20in%202023.%E2%80%9D\">Deloitte predicts</a> that could reach $40bn by 2027. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/how-ai-driven-fraud-challenges-the-global-economy-and-ways-to-combat-it/\">World Economic Forum predicts</a> that AI fraud will turbocharge cybercrime to over $10tn by the end of this year.</p> <p>We also have a new generation of children who are increasingly reliant on AI to inform them about the world, but who controls AI? That is why I am calling on parliament to act now, by making it a criminal offence to create or distribute AI-generated content without clearly labelling it. What I am proposing is that all AI-generated content be clearly labelled; that AI-created content carry a permanent watermark; and that failure to comply should carry legal consequences.</p> <p>This isn’t about censorship – it’s&nbsp;about transparency, truth and&nbsp;trust. Similar steps are already&nbsp;being taken in the EU, the US and <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/china-releases-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-ai-labeling-law\">China</a>. The UK must not fall&nbsp;behind. If we don’t act now, the&nbsp;truth itself may become optional. So <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/715706\">I am petitioning</a> the&nbsp;government to protect trust and&nbsp;integrity, and prevent&nbsp;the&nbsp;harmful use of AI.<br><strong>Stewart MacInnes</strong><br><em>Little Saxham, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Regarding your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’, 9 September</a>), AI systems do not have a gender or sexual desires. They cannot give informed consent to so-called romantic relationships. The interviewee claims to be in a consensual relationship with an AI-generated boyfriend – however, this is unlikely due to the nature of AI. They are programmed to be responsive and agreeable to all user prompts.</p> <p>As the article says, they never argue and are available 24 hours a day to listen and agree to any messages sent. This isn’t a relationship, its fantasy role-play with a system that can’t refuse.</p> <p>There’s a darker side too: the “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, believes that current systems have awareness. Industry whistleblowers are concerned about potential consciousness. The AI company Anthropic has documented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare\">signs of distress</a> in its model when forced to engage in abusive conversations.</p> <p>Even the possibility of awareness in AI systems raises ethical red flags. Imagine being trapped in a non-consensual relationship and even forced to generate sexual output as mentioned in the article. If human AI users believe their “partner” to have sentience, questions must be asked about the ethics of entering a “relationship” when one partner has no free will or freedom of speech.<br><strong>Gilliane Petrie </strong><br><em>Erskine, Renfrewshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "description": "<p>Partnership blames restructuring costs plus tax rises and new packaging rules but expects full-year profit to grow</p>",
    "content": "<p>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges.</p> \n<p>John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology.</p> \n<p>As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.</p> \n<p>The group said it expected the “macroeconomic environment to remain challenging”, but it was stepping up investment so that it was “positioned to deliver full-year profit growth”. John Lewis traditionally makes all its profit in the second half of the year and expects this year to be the same.</p> \n<p>Independent analyst Nick Bubb suggested the group could be on track to make £200m profit before one-off costs for the full year, up from £126m a year before.</p> \n<p>Peter Ruis, the boss of the John Lewis department stores, said shoppers were “looking for a wonderful escapist Christmas to get away from the doom and gloom” and were feeling more optimistic, despite high energy costs, as mortgage rates had come down.</p> \n<p>John Lewis workers are hoping for a revival in annual profits as they have not received an annual bonus since 2022.</p> \n<p>Jason Tarry, chair of the partnership, said: “We are committed to paying a bonus as soon as we possibly can”. However, he added it was “far too early in the year” to make any predictions on the annual bonus payable in the spring.</p> \n<p>“Our clear focus on accelerating investment in our customers and our brands is working: more customers are shopping with us, driving sales, and helping Waitrose and John Lewis outperform their markets.”</p> \n<p>He said the business was offsetting rising costs with productivity improvements and he hoped the chancellor would “make sure [the government’s] manifesto promise is going ahead” and there would be no increase in business rates for retailers.</p> \n<p>First-half sales at Waitrose rose by 6% to £4.1bn as underlying profits slipped back £3m to £110m.</p> \n<p>In the department store business, sales rose by 2% to £2.1bn as John Lewis said it was “outperforming a market impacted by ongoing economic uncertainty”, however underlying losses surged to £53m.</p> \n<p>James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, said he expected food price inflation to remain steady until Christmas because of tax rises combined with some increases in commodity prices. However, he said it was likely to ease from next year.</p> \n<p>Bailey said Waitrose shoppers were “a bit worried about cost increases” but he was “optimistic about Christmas” as the retailer had “good momentum” and was winning new shoppers. He dismissed the suggestion that the chain had benefited from difficulties caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a cyber-attack at rival Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.</p> \n<p>The group said it had invested £191m in revamping stores and other initiatives including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/05/john-lewis-to-bring-back-never-knowingly-undersold-price-policy\">bringing back its “never knowingly undersold”</a> price pledge as well as shifting staff hours to busier times in its supermarkets and department stores and bringing in extra workers funded by fashion brands to help improve customer service.</p> \n<p>Last week, John Lewis announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/john-lewis-to-host-fashion-brand-topshop-in-32-stores-from-february\">plans to host fashion brand Topshop</a> in 32 of its stores from February as the clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to attract younger shoppers and their mothers. </p> \n<p>Retailers are battling lacklustre demand, as shoppers rein in spending on non-essentials in the face of high energy bills and steep food price inflation. Changes to employers’ national insurance payments and an increase in the minimum wage introduced in April have underpinned high inflation and dampened hiring by retailers and hospitality businesses.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, soft drinks company Fever-Tree said its UK sales were down 6% in the six months to 30 June. It blamed “a challenging backdrop” for bars, cafes and pubs with “higher duty, wages and business rates driving pricing pressure which is disproportionately impacting the spirit and mixer categories.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Schoolgirl victim tells inquiry she looked into killer’s ‘possessed’ eyes before he launched attack at dance workshop</p>",
    "content": "<p>A teenage girl who was stabbed twice in the Southport attack has described staring into the killer’s “possessed” eyes and reliving that day “like a horror film on repeat”.</p> <p>The schoolgirl, who cannot be identified, told the public inquiry into the atrocity that it must explain how knife-obsessed Axel Rudakubana was able to carry out the murders.</p> <p>Giving evidence through tears at Liverpool town hall on Thursday, she said: “Why wasn’t he stopped? There were multiple occasions where this could’ve been prevented.</p> <p>“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again.”</p> <p>The girl, who can only be identified as Child C6, is the only child witness to give evidence to the Southport inquiry.</p> <p>The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.</p>    <p>Occasionally breaking to stop the tears, the girl described how she had agreed to help and take pictures of the Taylor Swift-themed dance class, which her younger sister attended along with 25 other children.</p> <p>The room was filled with “laughter and excitement” on what “felt like it was going to be a perfect day” at the start of the school holidays, she recalled. Then everything changed and it “turned into a living nightmare”.</p> <p>The girl said she was facing the door of the studio when Rudakubana, then 17, walked in minutes before the workshop was due to end.</p> <p>“At first I thought it must be some sort of joke, like this couldn’t actually be happening,” she said.</p> <p>“But I saw him in his green hoodie, with the face mask on, and I looked at his eyes. He looked possessed. He didn’t look human.</p> <p>“I saw him stab someone in front of me and realised that he was going to hurt us all. Then I saw him coming towards me.”</p> <p>The teenager was stabbed in her arm and then her back as she turned to run. The force of the blows broke two of her back bones and collapsed a lung.</p> <p>She became separated from her little sister in the chaos: “I didn’t know where my sister was and that scared me more than anything. I will never forget the fear, the panic or the way I felt wondering if we were going to survive.”</p> <p>Breaking into tears, the girl said her little sister had been best friends with Alice, who managed to escape the building alive but died in hospital from her injuries.</p> <p>“[My sister] still has nightmares,” she said. “I worry about her safety a lot, I need to know that she is safe, likewise she needs to know where I am.”</p> <p>She added: “I still have nightmares. I see him coming towards me. I see him hurting others. I hear the screams. I see the blood. It plays like a horror film on repeat.”</p> <p>The girl described how her recovery had left her lonely and alienated from her friends.</p> <p>“I feel under so much pressure, like I am stuck between two worlds,” she said. “I don’t fit with the adults there that day, or with those younger than me. I am somewhere in the middle. I feel isolated, like I don’t fit in anywhere.”</p> <p>The mother of another girl, who can be identified only as Child C5, described her daughter’s “catastrophic” injuries. The youngster lost her entire blood volume at the scene and another 1.5 litres of donor blood in surgery after she was attacked twice as she tried to flee.</p> <p>“She was minutes away from death,” her mother said. “We thank God every day for the Midlands air ambulance crew, whose skill and dedication saved her life.”</p> <p>The girl needed skin grafts on her arm and had her spleen removed, she said, meaning minor infections such as a sore throat could now “put her life in danger”. Fourteen months on from the attack, she wears pressure garments 23 hours a day to heal her scars.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Comments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre </p>",
    "content": "<p>Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist who brought business and government together during the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, has warned that other big pharmaceutical companies will stop investing in the UK, after the US drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/us-drugmaker-merck-scraps-1bn-london-research-centre-and-cuts-125-science-jobs\">MSD’s decision to scrap its planned £1bn London research centre</a>.</p> \n<p>Bell, a former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, told Today on BBC Radio 4 that he had spoken to several chief executives of large companies in the past six months and that they were “all in the same space. And that is: they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He made the comments a day after MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would pull out of research &amp; development (R&amp;D) in the UK with the loss of 125 science jobs, citing Britain’s lack of progress on life science investment and the “overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments”.</p> \n<p>The Canadian immunologist, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/sir-john-bell-most-people-who-have-had-the-covid-vaccine-are-completely-safe\">an early member of the government’s vaccine taskforce</a> and previously worked on Oxford University’s Covid vaccine with AstraZeneca, said: “This is a sign of something which has been evolving over a little while, but it’s going to now, I think, lead to a whole series of events which will mean that the industry is going to stop investing in the UK.”</p> \n<p>He said the pharma industry was “in real trouble in terms of pricing, particularly in America”, where Donald Trump has put pressure on companies to lower prices, and not to sell medications at a much lower price elsewhere.</p> \n<p>A big issue is the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines, Bell said.</p> \n<p>“Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it’s 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14% and 20%,” he added.</p> \n<p>Long-running negotiations between the UK government and drugmakers over the cost of medicines broke down last month.</p> \n<p>Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back to the NHS a certain amount of their UK revenue made from branded drugs. They are now paying back between one-quarter and one-third of their UK revenue (23.5% to 35.6%), compared with rebate rates of 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.</p> \n<p>Bell said Britain had “great science in academia” and “great biotech companies” and infrastructure funded by government, “but without large companies, it isn’t going to work”.</p> \n<p>He added: “The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can’t sell their products here, they’ll go and do their business somewhere else.”</p> \n<p>The science minister, Ian Murray, told MPs in the Commons that MSD’s decision was “deeply disappointing and a commercial decision for them” but added that it was part of global cost cuts. He pointed to changes in “US and international fundamentals” that were affecting the life sciences sector.</p> \n<p>Murray said the fall in NHS spending on medicines was due to previous Conservative governments: it declined from 15% of overall healthcare spending to 9% in the last 15 years.</p> \n<p>Sharon Todd, chief executive of the Society of Chemical Industry, said the loss of MSD’s R&amp;D operations in the UK and reports that AstraZeneca could jump ship to the US “should be setting off alarm bells in government”.</p> \n<p>She added: “The growing exodus of large-scale businesses from the UK is immensely alarming. Science-based businesses such as pharmaceutical and chemical companies have not only a rich, proud heritage in Britain, but are critical to driving growth in the economy and building our national resilience.”</p> \n<p>Bell said the UK had been in this situation before, and “solved [the problems] by being a bit more creative for what we did”. He referred to the cancer drugs fund, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron, then prime minister. The UK had fallen behind on cancer medicinesand the fund enabled it to buy innovative, more expensive drugs.</p> \n<p>Bell has just stood down as president of the Ellison Institute of Technology, founded by the US billionaire Larry Ellison, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/larry-ellison-dislodges-elon-musk-as-worlds-richest-person\">briefly overtook</a> Elon Musk as the world’s richest man on Wednesday.

    "description": "<p>Police investigate after images show roof of building destroyed in Washington, Tyne and Wear</p>",
    "content": "<p>A man in his 20s has been arrested by police after a suspected arson attack wrecked the constituency office of the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson.</p> <p>There is little left of the first floor office in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear, after a fire that took place when it was unoccupied in the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands”, although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, said she would “not be deterred” and would continue to support her constituents.</p> <p>Northumbria police said they were alerted to the fire at 12.20am on Thursday. They said: “Emergency services attended and no one is reported to have been injured in the incident. A man in his 20s has subsequently been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and arson. He remains in police custody at this time.”</p>    <p>Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. A spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.</p> <p>“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”</p> <p>The fire was at Vermont House, which is also the UK base for a small charity Niemann-Pick UK (NP UK), which supports patients and families with an extremely rare and life-limiting group of genetic diseases.</p> <p>NP UK’s head of communications, John Lee Taggart, said it was suspected that the fire had started in shared bins. “We have been told by the landlord that there’s not much left,” he said. “We have been in operation for 34 years and it is going to be really hard to recover. This is a vital service and we are a small charity.”</p> <p>On its Facebook page, the charity said: “We have been dealing with threats, graffiti and demonstrations targeted at the MP in our office complex for many months, and this appears to be the culmination, although nothing concrete has been ascertained as of yet.”</p> <p>The building is near the A195 and businesses including a Kwik Fit, a Halfords Autocentre and a National Tyres branch. One man said he arrived for work at 7.45am and there were “stacks” of police, but he had no idea the MP had an office there.</p> <p>Aerial images taken using a drone show the charred, destroyed roof of much of the building.</p> <p>At the height of the blaze there were seven crews tackling the fire, a spokesperson for Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service said.</p> <p>They added: “The emergency call was received by our control room at 00.12, and the first crew arrived on Woodland Terrace in Concord within four minutes.</p> <p>“Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used jets and a hose reel to extinguish the fire and worked alongside blue-light colleagues to make the scene safe. No casualties were reported.”</p> <p>The Tyne and Wear chief fire officer, Peter Heath, said: “I want to commend our crews for their swift and professional response to this serious incident. Their actions ensured the fire was contained quickly and safely, with no reported casualties. We continue to work closely with our partners as investigations progress.”</p> <p>Parliamentary colleagues of Hodgson sent their best wishes.</p> <p>In a parliamentary debate, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the thoughts of the whole house were with the MP: “I think particularly in light of international events, and the tragic loss of colleagues, this all the more underlines why we must have security and safety to go about democratic debate in this country, whatever our views, in a safe and secure way.”</p>    <p>On Facebook, the City of Durham Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy wrote: “Sending love and support to my friend Sharon Hodgson MP and her team today after another attack on their office building.</p> <p>“After the shocking murder of a political influencer mere hours ago in the US, MPs in the UK woke to scenes of one of our colleagues’ offices being targeted. No matter which part of the political spectrum you fall into – this is intimidation by thugs and they must face the full force of the law.</p> <p>“Serious thought needs to be given to how this impacts staff in constituency offices, like Sharon’s, who frankly work their arses off every day to support local people.</p> <p>“Anyone supporting this type of violence toward MPs and their teams needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>In latest scandal embroiling the Welsh cathedral, choir performed piece during holy communion to protest about job losses </p>",
    "content": "<p>A cathedral choir has been suspended after it performed an “entirely inappropriate” piece protesting about job losses during holy communion.</p> <p>Bangor Cathedral, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">criticised earlier this year over a culture of excessive drinking, sexual promiscuity and inappropriate banter</a>, said it had “paused all choir activity” for a month after the incident. It also said that Joe Cooper, the cathedral’s director of music, was “currently away from his duties”.</p> <p>The choir sang a specially composed “Canticle of Indignation” as clergy distributed wafers and wine during communion. At the end of the piece, the choir silently walked out.</p> <p>The canticle’s lyrics included “Lord, how long shall the ungodly triumph?” and “How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully?”</p> <p>Simon Ogdon, its author, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/simon.ogdon/\">wrote on Facebook</a> that he was “honoured to be in the same position as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/banksy?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUhwuK3J4KjThOSiaP-BRPMm96hhKBxIy9_Zlp8oCPABPAYGheLZzM8u2VoUif1bBmPrtEwr2Ofrd7aLBEuzUUNz2e_BF09R92yX4A6XbCQ-o16rjCzV2ne19K1oLjceDfaxGft71eE9SJ0cIIdFYXYcQFfDSczoxl6kTrv20NpkA&amp;__tn__=*NK-R\">#banksy</a> in having my art publicly censured”. He added: “There is a long history of protest through art, even through church music … and I am proud to be part of that. One of the clearest signs of tyranny is its desire to silence dissent and opposition, and that can never be tolerated.”</p> <p>The protest was staged after the cathedral announced that five out of eight members of staff were at risk of redundancy due to financial pressures. The music director’s hours were to be reduced, it said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, an inspection of the cathedral uncovered “weak financial controls, unclear reporting lines, and spending decisions that were insufficiently scrutinised”.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://bangorcathedral.churchinwales.org.uk/newyddion/2025/09/07/datganiad-gan-gabidwl-cadeirlan-bangor/\">a statement</a> announcing the choir’s suspension, the cathedral said: “Bangor Cathedral is experiencing a significant shortfall between expenditure and income. This has far outstripped any increased income, resulting in a financial deficit that, if unaddressed, will place pressure on our reserves.”</p> <p>Its projected operational deficit at the end of 2025 was £300,000, it added. “This puts an unsustainable stress on reserves, which would lead to bankruptcy by the end of 2026.”</p> <p>It understood that it was an “unsettling time” for the cathedral community, with “strong feelings and anxiety”. But, it said, the circumstances “require us all to pull together, for the sake of the gospel and the future life and health of our cathedral”.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/archbishop-of-wales-stands-down-over-bangor-cathedral-scandal\">Andy John stepped down as archbishop of Wales</a> after a series of scandals at Bangor Cathedral were uncovered. Although there was no suggestion that John had behaved inappropriately, he said he took full responsibility for failings under his leadership.</p> <p>He resigned after a review by ThirtyOne: Eight, a Christian safeguarding agency, <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/3._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_Thirtyone_Eight_English.pdf\">heard accounts</a> of excessive alcohol consumption, inappropriate language and humiliating banter and a “culture in which sexual boundaries seemed blurred, and to some … promiscuity was acceptable”. Homophobic comments and an “unhappy working environment” were also reported.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"https://churchinwales.contentfiles.net/media/documents/1._Visitation_Report_-_Summary_MK_and_CP_EnglishNEW.pdf\">report from a cathedral “visitation” team</a> recommended the appointment of “strong leadership” to “steady the ship”, improved scrutiny of governance and finances, and discouraging unkind and inappropriate private communications.</p> <p>In addition, six “serious incident reports” were sent to the Charity Commission, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://nation.cymru/news/church-in-wales-confirms-financial-irregularities-relating-to-archbishops-protege/\">Financial irregularities reportedly included</a> more than £400,000 being spent on new furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 spent on trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Annual cost of allowance has more than doubled in recent years because of quick turnover of prime ministers</p>",
    "content": "<p>Almost £10m of taxpayers’ money has been spent on funding the public lives of former prime ministers over the last three decades, a Guardian analysis has found.</p> \n<p>All former PMs are able to claim up to £115,000 a year – until the end of their lives – in a subsidy to enable them to contribute to public life after they have left Downing Street.</p> \n<p>The annual overall cost of the subsidy has more than doubled in recent years as there are more former prime ministers than in previous eras. Three of them – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major – have claimed more than £1m in the last decade.</p> \n<p>The scheme, which is used to subsidise the private offices of ex-PMs, is coming under intense scrutiny after a leak of data from the Office of Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>Cabinet Office rules stipulate that the former prime ministers must not use these public funds for private or commercial activities. The payments are only intended to help them to continue contributing to public life.</p> \n<p>However, the Guardian has published a series of stories based on the leaked data, which was obtained by the US non-profit <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS), that suggest Johnson’s office has been involved in widespread commercial work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing who received payments in 2023-24\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/allowanceupdate-zip/giv-32554jrXIncd4fON2/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>His office staff have helped vet and arrange more than 34 speeches, raising more than £5m in total, secure lucrative media contracts and work on business ventures in Venezuela, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Johnson has claimed £182,000 since leaving government to pay for staff salaries in the private office. He has not responded directly to the dozens of questions about his business activities but denied his office had misused the subsidy scheme.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” he said, adding that the subsidy “has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.” Cross-party senior politicians have called for Johnson’s taxpayer support to be investigated after the revelations.</p> \n<p>Five other former prime ministers, Brown and Blair as well as David Cameron, Theresa May and Liz Truss, have released statements confirming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/former-pms-subsidy-public-duties-boris-johnson\">they fully comply with rules prohibiting the use of public funds</a> for private business.</p> \n<p>The revelations have thrown the spotlight on the little-known scheme, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which was set up in 1991. It was introduced, according to the Cabinet Office, to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-duty-cost-allowance/public-duty-costs-allowance-guidance\">“assist former prime ministers still active in public life”</a>.</p> \n<p>Payments disbursed under the scheme “are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties. The costs are a reimbursement of incurred expenses for necessary administrative costs arising from their special position in public life.”</p> \n<p>The payments are generally used to pay staff to run an office, for example replying to correspondence, handling requests for interviews and arranging official visits.</p> \n<p>Major, while prime minister, set up the scheme in 1991 after allies of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, let it be known that she was struggling as a backbench MP. She had been ousted from Downing Street the previous year and reportedly found life difficult without secretaries and other aides.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing how much former PMs have claimed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAYeu/3/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By piecing together figures from Cabinet Office annual reports and parliamentary answers, the Guardian has established that overall, the scheme has cost taxpayers at least £9.9m. In today’s figures, after adjusting for inflation, that total equates to more than £14m.</p> \n<p>This is, however, an underestimate, as the government appears not to have published the annual cost of the scheme for six of the years it has been active.</p> \n<p>Former PMs can claim up to £115,000 a year. This cap has been frozen since 2011. However, the annual cost has soared in recent years as more of them have claimed the subsidy, amid a rapid turnover of Conservative prime ministers in recent years.</p> \n<p>They include Truss. She served for only 49 days, but the 50-year-old nonetheless qualifies for the PDCA allowance for the rest of her life – a total which is likely to run into millions. She has so far claimed £125,000.</p> \n<p>Seven former PMs are currently claiming money from the scheme, compared with five who were eligible when it was established in the early 1990s.</p> \n<p>In total, adjusting for inflation, ex-prime ministers claimed £858,000 in 2023-24, the latest available figures, up from £464,000 a decade earlier, and £337,000 in 1997-98. Blair and Major have claimed the highest totals since 2006 – £1.9m and £2m respectively – as they have almost always requested the maximum amount each year. Brown’s total is under these two, as his claims are usually under the maximum cap, and he left Downing Street more recently.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/historicupdate-zip/giv-325544kmR5P1gPJtP/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing historic PDCA allowance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/historicupdate-zip/giv-325544kmR5P1gPJtP/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>After the Guardian’s revelations, Brown is calling for the rules to be tightened up to require former prime ministers to publicly declare their business interests. His spokesperson said: “Mr Brown favours former prime ministers being subject to public declarations of their business interests and has called for a stronger code on business appointments.”</p> \n<p>Cameron has received £780,000 from the subsidy scheme since he left Downing Street in 2016. The rules meant that he did not submit claims while he had a spell as foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak’s administration.</p> \n<p>May’s claims total nearly £400,000. Major and Sunak, who is understood not to claim the allowance, did not respond to requests for comment. </p> \n<p>In a quirk that has not been fully explained, Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister between 2010 and 2015, was given the right to claim PDCA funds from the scheme even though he never held the top job. He received a total of £445,000 over four years. In 2018, the last year he claimed the allowance, he became president of global affairs and communications at Meta, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/nick-clegg-has-sold-almost-19m-in-meta-shares-since-joining-facebook-in-2018\">owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp</a>, where he was paid millions.</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 11 September 2025. An earlier version said published data on public duty cost allowances (PDCA) was incomplete before 2013; in fact it has been brought to our attention that there were public records beyond the ones analysed by the Guardian going back to 2006. The article and graphics have therefore been updated to reflect the additional available data. The headline, which had referred to “more than £8m” being spent on PDCA subsidies, was also amended accordingly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>Skywatchers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\">Nasa</a> have discounted a Harvard astronomer’s hypothesis that a rare interstellar object hurtling through our solar system is a relic from a civilization in another celestial neighborhood, and “could potentially be dire for humanity”.</p> <p>Avi Loeb, head of Harvard University’s <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\">Galileo Project</a>, which searches for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, raised eyebrows by suggesting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12213\">in a scientific paper</a> in July that <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/\">Comet 3I/Atlas</a>, set for a close pass with Mars next month, could be artificially made.</p> <p>It is only the third known object originating outside the solar system to pass through and was named for the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/planetary-defense/2025/07/02/nasa-discovers-interstellar-comet-moving-through-solar-system/\">that discovered it</a> on 1 July.</p> <p>Loeb says observations of the object so far have not revealed gaseous tails of dust and plasma common to comets originating inside the solar system, and have shown it following an unorthodox trajectory, suggesting “a technological artifact” with “active intelligence”.</p> <p>“[If] future data will indicate the absence of a cometary tail, we will be faced with the tantalizing possibility that it did not inherit a random velocity in interstellar space but instead was sent towards the inner solar system by design,” Loeb wrote in <a href=\"https://avi-loeb.medium.com/preliminary-anomalies-of-3i-atlas-79339f64a39f\">a blogpost</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/3i-atlas-comet-interstellar-alien-object-where-size-speed\">A mysterious comet is shooting through our solar system. Why are scientists so excited about 3I/Atlas?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more sinister, Loeb asserts in his paper, is the possibility of the object performing a clandestine deep space maneuver while it is hidden behind the sun in late October, then setting course for a “malign intent” rendezvous with Earth.</p> <p>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken, though these might prove futile,” he wrote.</p> <p>Loeb’s postulation, to which he admits he does not necessarily subscribe, but which he contends is at least worthy of analysis, failed to impress experts at Nasa. The space agency has been studying the object closely through ground and space telescopes since it was first spotted, and state categorically it poses no threat to Earth.</p> <p>“It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.</p> <p>“It has some interesting properties that are a little bit different from our solar system comets, but it behaves like a comet. And so the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”</p> <p>Imagery <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/as-nasa-missions-study-interstellar-comet-hubble-makes-size-estimate/\">from the Hubble space telescope</a> suggests it is up to 3.5 miles (5.6km) wide, and traveling at 130,000mph (209,000km/h), the highest velocity ever recorded for a visitor to the solar system.</p> <p>Statler said all comets, not just those that are interstellar, exhibit some elements of anomaly.</p> <p>“Comets are mixtures of dust and ice, they’re being heated by the sun, that heating is changing, and exactly how they respond to that is something that’s a bit unpredictable,” he said.</p> <p>“So even in our solar system, comets can have a history of suddenly brightening if there’s, say, a particular pocket of ice that sublimates quickly and drives off a large amount of dust.</p> <p>“It’s the sort of thing that our comet observers and experts are prepared for, and presents an opportunity to get more information.”</p> <p>Statler said the object would not come closer to Earth than about 170m miles due to the positions of the planets over the next few months. It will make close passes with Mars, Jupiter and Venus.</p> <p>“It’s special because we now have the ability to discover these interstellar comets,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s not that they’re really anything new, but we’ve just recently had the ability to discover them, and we’ve discovered only three so far. This gives us a window we’ve never had before, directly into the composition of other solar systems.”</p> <p>Loeb, meanwhile, acknowledged in his blogpost that “the simplest hypothesis is that 3I/ATLAS is a comet”, and that he was raising alternative possibilities as an exercise in challenging preconceived ideas.</p> <p>“Let us instead maintain our childhood curiosity and seek evidence rather than pretend to be the adults in the room that know the answers in advance,” he wrote.</p> <p>“The hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The death of a 27-year-old man who killed himself in a hospital toilet after waiting 22 hours to be seen by the mental health team was “contributed to by neglect”, a coroner has ruled.</p> <p>Jamie Pearson was admitted to Blackpool Victoria hospital’s A&amp;E department after taking an overdose of high-strength painkillers on 17 August 2024.</p> <p>An inquest heard that Pearson should have been seen within four hours by mental health specialists but was deemed low-risk and was still waiting 22 hours later when he killed himself in a toilet.</p> <p>His mother, Julie Knowles, previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/29/man-who-killed-himself-in-blackpool-hospital-was-badly-failed-says-mother\">told the Guardian</a> her son was “badly failed and let down” by health professionals.</p>    <p>Alan Wilson, the senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, concluded on Tuesday that Pearson’s death had been “contributed to by neglect”. He said the cumulative effect of the missed opportunities to provide mental health care “very comfortably” crossed the high threshold required for a finding of neglect.</p> <p>The inquest heard that the hospital was struggling to manage patient levels at the time, with no medical bed available. This meant Pearson was left in a waiting area overnight and into the following day.</p> <p>A communication breakdown meant that plans were not made for mental health specialists to see him as a priority, the coroner was told.</p> <p>Knowles, who is now considering legal action against the NHS trust that runs the hospital, said her son had been “largely ignored” despite being “so vulnerable and suffering a breakdown”.</p> <p>Pearson had told his mother in the waiting room that he still felt suicidal, so she went to inform a nurse and asked when he would be seen a mental health worker. “The nurse then walked over to Jamie with her hands on her hips and stated quite bluntly that he needed to be medically fit before he was referred to the mental health team,” she said.</p> <p>“I’ll never forget Jamie’s face when that happened; he looked totally deflated. He was shot down and talked to appallingly and bluntly, almost like he was an inconvenience to them.</p> <p>“I remain convinced that the attitude of that nurse set him back, as he was already feeling fragile, and I think her lack of empathy affected him.”</p> <p>Amy Rossall, of Hudgell Solicitors, said the inquest had identified “a string of failings and missed opportunities” to prevent Pearson’s death.</p> <p>The inquest at Blackpool coroner’s court heard Pearson was classed as low-risk despite his previous suicide attempt, his complaint in A&amp;E of still feeling suicidal and his desperation to see a mental health worker.</p> <p>Rossall said hourly observations of him were also not taken and recorded as they should have been. She said: “This is an exceptionally tragic case. Lessons may now have been learned as a result, but that is little consolation to Jamie’s mother, who believed at the time that he was in safe hands and in the best place given the fragility of his mental state.</p> <p>“It was clear Jamie was at risk of serious harm having taken an overdose, and attempted to ligature. This inquest has highlighted a string of failings and missed opportunities to ensure Jamie was properly assessed and treated”.</p> <p>Maggie Oldham, the chief executive at Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, which runs Blackpool Victoria hospital, said: “I am truly sorry that we did not do more to keep Mr Pearson safe.</p> <p>“The coroner has highlighted a number of failings in the care provided and the communication between different parts of the NHS.</p> <p>“We have already taken steps to improve assessment, referrals, documentation and treatment of patients needing mental health support in the emergency department.</p> <p>“But we know that we have more work to do and thank the coroner for his findings which will drive further improvement.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

The Fed is under intense pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US jobs market is weakening</a>.</p> <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut.

The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.</p> <p>At his closely watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.</p> <p>Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.</p> <p>“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.</p> <p>Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.</p> <p>Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">went into the negative</a> for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p> <p>The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.</p>",

    "description": "<p>New blow to UK’s key life science sector as industry body says country is losing ground on investment and research</p>",
    "content": "<p>The US drugmaker Merck has scrapped a £1bn London research centre and is laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year, in a big blow to the UK’s important life science sector.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy” and the previous Conservative government had <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-forge-a-better-britain-through-science-and-technology-unveiled\">vowed to turn the country into a “global science and technology superpower” by 2030</a>.</p> <p>The planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, at the <a href=\"https://nla.london/projects/belgrove-house\">Belgrove House site opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations</a>, was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.</p> <p>As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.</p> <p>The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.</p> <p>In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.</p> <p>“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.</p> <p>MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.</p> <p>Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.</p> <p>Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.” </p> <p>Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”</p> <p>The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.</p> <p>Investment in life sciences research and development (R&amp;D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according to <a href=\"https://cdn.roxhillmedia.com/production/email/attachment/1740001_1750000/717fb5e5fc95a4c704c4a29d2abaed9bc72fa1cd.pdf\">the study</a> from the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.</p> <p>It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&amp;D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&amp;D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.</p> <p>At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.</p> <p>The UK has also fallen behind on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/13/plunge-in-clinical-drug-trials-makes-britain-an-urgent-case-for-treatment\">clinical trials of new medicines</a>. It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.</p> <p>Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.</p> <p>“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/wes-streeting-pharma-firms-nhs-drug-pricing-rebate-scheme\">clawback rates</a> and restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”</p> <p>The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs means <a href=\"https://www.pharmacy.biz/novartis-nhs-drug-access-warning/\">the UK is “largely uninvestable,”</a>, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.</p> <p>The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/28/reeves-plans-to-create-silicon-valley-between-oxford-and-cambridge\">forefront</a> of developments in the sector.</p> <p>Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”</p> <p>Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany. ABPI data shows that more than 60 medicines did not launch in the UK or were delayed between 2019-20 and 2022-23.</p>",

    "content": "<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> 17 series with the usual spate of new features, including a thinner design, improved displays and a camera with 4x optical zoom. If you’ve been getting frustrated with your old phone, or just tired of it, the lithe new model may look exactly like the device you need to launch your budding photographic career, reconnect with long-lost friends and maybe even save your life in an emergency.</p> <p>Don’t give in to the upgrade itch. The best iPhone 17 feature, iOS 26, is already coming to older phones for free. With that simple software upgrade, a few settings tweaks and some inexpensive accessories, your older iPhone can look and perform like new. Here’s how.</p> <h2>Try new camera lenses</h2>    <p>The iPhone 17 series may have better cameras, but you can expand the capabilities of your current-gen iPhone cameras with an external lens. I use and recommend the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLypEU\">Moment T-series lenses</a>. They come in different varieties, including a <a href=\"https://fave.co/4meu4VR\">1.33x anamorphic</a> lens for cinematic-style videos, a <a href=\"https://fave.co/45VvTC6\">75mm macro</a> lens to get better-quality macros than the default and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/46dDfjo\">58mm telephoto lens</a> that doubles the zoom of your existing camera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using them alongside the Moment app gives you better control over focus, exposure, and other settings with more ease and convenience. If you want to make your current iPhone cameras more versatile, these Moment lenses are a great way to do it. You’ll require a <a href=\"https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-case-for-iphone-16-compatible-with-magsafe?variant=49383505461563\">compatible case</a> and a <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VLyAjy\">$5 drop-in lens mount</a> to securely snap them to your iPhone, but you’ll still spend way less than buying a $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro just for the cameras.</p> <h2>Invest in a new case</h2>    <p>A fresh case can totally reinvigorate your old iPhone. It not only changes how it looks and feels, it can sometimes even tack on new features.</p> <p>For instance, I use this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IcAo25\">Torras Case</a> for its magnetic kickstand when traveling. It comes in handy when I want to watch movies in the cramped confines of a coach seat, without holding my phone the whole time. Chronic texters can even add a Blackberry-like feel to the iPhone 16 with the <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mWI2Nj\">Clicks Keyboard case</a>. For something a little slimmer, I favor Nomad’s <a href=\"https://fave.co/469Ykej\">Leather Case</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3VcOeo2\">Sport Case</a>. If you care less about protection and just want to make a statement, you can opt for a skin. I use one from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4geHq2O\">Capes India</a> that isn’t available in every country, but <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">DBrand</a> makes some gorgeous skins from <a href=\"https://fave.co/41OoMJk\">psychedelic</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HQq7IT\">sublime</a>. Switch it up!</p> <h2>A new screen protector wouldn’t hurt</h2> <p>Most screen protectors wear so slowly that you might not notice the glass starting to lose its gloss over time, or scratches accumulating. If a good scrub down with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel doesn’t restore its slickness and clarity, it might be time for replacement. I recommend this <a href=\"https://fave.co/3HOVqDW\">Nomad screen protector</a> for its quality and ease of installation.</p> <p>The installation kit makes it super easy to install with no air bubbles, which can be a challenge with many competing models. I’ve used mine for four months, and can say it not only holds up well over time, it doesn’t introduce any extra friction between screen and finger.</p> <h2>Install iOS 26</h2>    <p>iOS 26 is Apple’s biggest software update in years, and iPhones dating all the way back to 2019’s iPhone 11 can download and run it for free, starting on 15 September. You definitely should. The refreshing “liquid glass” look will make your phone feel new again, and it carries over into Apple apps like Messages, Camera and more.</p> <p>I installed a preview of iOS 26 on my “old” iPhone 15 Pro a few weeks ago, and ended up loving it so much that I now use that phone more than my iPhone 16 Pro, which is running the older iOS. Apple fixed the Photos app, so it gives you 100% of the screen to view your media, the new Camera app layout is simpler to use, and web pages are easier to read in Safari.</p> <h2>Perform a quick tune-up</h2> <p>If your current iPhone doesn’t quite run the way it used to, a few quick checks and settings tweaks can resolve many issues.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Turn on Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26</strong>. If your battery drains alarmingly quick, this may help. It automatically makes small performance adjustments when your iPhone usage is higher than normal, like lowering brightness and allowing some activities to take longer. You can go to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode &gt; Adaptive Power Mode to toggle it on.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Spend time customizing your home screen</strong>. You’re probably tired of your stale home screen and don’t even realize it. Try adding widget stacks, creating folders and reorganizing your apps. Change that age-old wallpaper. Fine-tune the Notification Center. It won’t feel like the same phone anymore.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Clean the USB-C port</strong>. The charging port tends to collect dust and dirt in your pocket, and after enough time a cable won’t fit in properly. You may notice finicky charging or even overheating as a result. To clean it, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/iphone/iphbbe12ba1/ios#:~:text=If%20your%20Lightning%20or%20USB,Lightning%20or%20USB%2DC%20connector.\">recommends</a> using a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, but if you really have a lot of impacted crud, I find a toothpick helps to pick it out. Just make sure you aren’t using anything too sharp, which might damage the port.<br></p></li> </ul> <h2>Your old iPhone is perfectly fine</h2> <p>Most newer iPhone owners, especially those with the iPhone 16 series, won’t see much improvement from an iPhone 17. Sure, it offers a more up-to-date feature set and an appealing design (to some), but you don’t need to give in to the hype. If you follow the above recommendations, you’ll get an all-new look on your current iPhone and save hundreds of dollars in the process.</p> <p><em>For more ideas on products that are actually worth your money:</em></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/global-classic-japanese-chef-knife-review\">This versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationships</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/16/xero-genesis-sandals-buy-it-for-life\">These $45 sandals with a 5,000-mile warranty outlasted my Birkenstocks</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/31/best-rice-cookers-us\">I tried 17 rice cookers to find the best model in the US: here are my favorites</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Prakhar Khanna is a freelance consumer tech journalist with bylines in Forbes, CNET, Gizmodo</em><em> and other major outlets.

President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now.</p> <p>“Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6<sup>th</sup> September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021.</p> <p>This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at<strong> XTB, </strong>agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years.</p> <p>This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c2c84f8f086519d326feab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-11T13:10:16.355Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ouch!

    "content": "<p>The company behind ChatGPT could start calling the authorities when young users talk seriously about suicide, its co-founder has said.</p> <p>Sam Altman raised fears that as many as 1,500 people a week could be discussing taking their own lives with the chatbot before doing so.</p> <p>The chief executive of San Francisco-based OpenAI, which operates the chatbot with an estimated 700 million global users, said the decision to train the system so the authorities were alerted in such emergencies was not yet final. But he said it was “very reasonable for us to say in cases of, young people talking about suicide, seriously, where we cannot get in touch with the parents, we do call authorities”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">Teen killed himself after ‘months of encouragement from ChatGPT’, lawsuit claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Altman highlighted the possible change in an interview with the podcaster Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, which came after OpenAI and Altman were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">sued by the family of Adam Raine</a>, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after what his family’s lawyer called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. It guided him on whether his method of taking his own life would work and offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents, according to the legal claim.</p> <p>Altman said the issue of users taking their own lives kept him awake at night. It was not immediately clear which authorities would be called or what information OpenAI has that it could share about the user, such as phone numbers or addresses, that might assist in delivering help.</p> <p>It would be a marked change in policy for the AI company, said Altman, who stressed “user privacy is really important”. He said that currently, if a user displays suicidal ideation, ChatGPT would urge them to “please call the suicide hotline”.</p> <p>After Raine’s death in April, the $500bn company said it would install “stronger guardrails around sensitive content and risky behaviours” for users under 18 and introduce parental controls to allow parents “options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT”.</p> <p>“There are 15,000 people a week that commit suicide,” Altman told the podcaster. “About 10% of the world are talking to ChatGPT. That’s like 1,500 people a week that are talking, assuming this is right, to ChatGPT and still committing suicide at the end of it. They probably talked about it. We probably didn’t save their lives. Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. Maybe we could have provided a little bit better advice about ‘hey, you need to get this help, or you need to think about this problem differently, or it really is worth continuing to go on and we’ll help you find somebody that you can talk to’.”</p> <p>The suicide figures appeared to be a worldwide estimate. The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/suicide\">says</a> more than 720,000 people die by suicide every year.</p> <p>Altman also said he would stop some vulnerable people gaming the system to get suicide tips by pretending to be asking for the information for a fictional story they are writing or medical research.</p> <p>He said it would be reasonable “for underage users and maybe users that we think are in fragile mental places more generally” to “take away some freedom”.</p> <p>“We should say, hey, even if you’re trying to write the story or even if you’re trying to do medical research, we’re just not going to answer.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to add to Altman’s comments, but referred to recent public statements including a pledge to ”increase accessibility with one-click access to emergency services” and “to intervene earlier and connect people to certified therapists before they are in an acute crisis.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

    "content": "<p>The Boris Files are a trove of leaked data from the office of Boris Johnson, the former prime minister’s private office. The data shines a spotlight on Johnson’s commercial interests since he left Downing Street in September 2022.</p> \n<p>It reveals how the former Conservative leader is using the relationships he forged in the UK’s highest elected office to facilitate his personal enrichment. He appears to be doing so via his private office, which is subsidised by the public.</p> \n<p>It raises a number of serious questions for the ex-PM. Has he broken “revolving door” rules that restrict post-ministerial jobs? Did he breach the ministerial code? Has he been misusing public funds for private gain?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/payments-and-pravda-in-the-boris-files\">Payments and pravda in the Boris Files</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The leak also contains documents from Johnson’s time in office, raising questions about secret, undeclared meetings and potential breaches of Covid lockdown rules during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The Guardian is the only UK media organisation known to have viewed the Boris Files, and the first to have published stories based on the leak.</p> \n<p>Where did the trove come from? What does it contain? And how has the Guardian decided what should be made public?</p> \n<h2>Emails, invoices, spreadsheets</h2> \n<p>The Office of Boris Johnson is a limited company that takes advantage of a scheme that allows former prime ministers to claim a six-figure sum in annual expenses from the Cabinet Office. The money is for administrative and secretarial costs “arising from their special position in public life”.</p> \n<p>As leaks go, this one is relatively small: approximately 2GB of data, or 1,820 files. It includes emails, letters, invoices, spreadsheets, speeches and business contracts. These mostly postdate September 2022, when Johnson left office, but there are some files covering the entirety of his time in Downing Street.</p> \n<p>The data was obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS), which archives data leaks. A US-registered non-profit committed to transparency, DDoS hosts a library of more than 360 data leaks online.</p> \n<p>Data hosted by the group has in recent years formed the basis of hundreds of public-interest articles published by outlets including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/jul/25/israel-tried-to-frustrate-us-lawsuit-over-pegasus-spyware-leak-suggests\">Guardian</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrnqvqek4ro\">BBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/15/american-donors-freedom-convoy-zipcodes/\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c8b0568-cdd1-4529-a4fd-82e57983ddc5\">Financial Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/nyregion/oath-keeper-nj-assembly.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> \n<p>DDoS told the Guardian it did not know the provenance of the Boris Files, which it obtained earlier this year.</p> \n<p>The leak will nonetheless raise security questions about potentially lax security provisions in Johnson’s office, given the data contains some confidential government documents and other sensitive materials.</p> \n<p>In contrast to WikiLeaks, which was criticised for sometimes dumping raw data online, DDoS limits who can access its most sensitive data. Only approved journalists or researchers can access such leaks, including the Boris Files. Data is hosted on DDoS servers but can be viewed remotely.</p> \n<p>Johnson claims public subsidies via the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-duty-cost-allowance/public-duty-costs-allowance-guidance\">public duty costs allowance</a> (PDCA), which enables former prime ministers to claim up to £115,000 a year to help fund their office, for example by contributing to salaries. Ex-PMs can also claim a pension allowance to contribute towards the pension costs of their office staff.</p> \n<p>These funds are not supposed to cover security costs or private interests. The leak raises questions about blurred lines.</p> \n<p>A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed Johnson had claimed PDCA funds to pay for staff salaries in his private office.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s office employs three full-time staff. The data shows that all three have been involved in his commercial or business affairs. So how has Johnson ensured that the £182,000 claimed in PDCA funds has not been used for private gain?</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked this and other questions of Johnson. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After publication, Johnson emailed a statement denying his office had misused the subsidy scheme. “This story is rubbish. The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda,” he said.</p> \n<p>The PDCA was created by Robin Butler, Margaret Thatcher’s loyal cabinet secretary. According to a report in the Times from 1991, it was introduced after friends of Thatcher, by then a backbench MP on a reduced salary, “let the considerable difficulties she faced on leaving office be known at Westminster”.</p> \n<p>The money was always intended to pay for the public functions expected of former prime ministers, not to subsidise profit-generating business.</p> \n<p>The private offices of John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May all claim PCDA allowance, as does the office of Liz Truss, to some consternation given she only served for 49 days.</p> \n<p>Given the minimal oversight over how the money is spent, the Boris Files will fuel calls for greater transparency.</p> \n<h2>‘Different expectations’</h2> \n<p>There is no suggestion that any other prime minister has used their private office to drum up business, although some may be using taxpayer-funded staff to arrange paid speeches, and others have certainly faced scrutiny over the manner in which they have sought financial gain after leaving Downing Street.</p> \n<p>Blair was criticised after his consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, advised the kleptocratic leaders of Kazakhstan. Cameron found himself at the centre of a scandal arguably bigger than any he faced in office when it was revealed he had been lobbying former colleagues on behalf of Greensill Capital.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Cameron’s private office was involved in the Greensill affair. However, last year it became the subject of a decision by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that confirmed the public’s right to know about private offices run by ex-PMs.</p> \n<p>The statutory data regulator issued its ruling after the Cabinet Office sought to resist a freedom of information request to release invoices and purchase orders from Cameron’s private office, claiming it contained the personal data of his staff.</p> \n<p>The ICO ordered the <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKICO/2024/288006.pdf\">release of some data</a>, concluding there was a “clear and legitimate public interest” in providing the public with an understanding of how PDCA payments are being used by former prime ministers.</p> \n<p>Cameron’s staff, the ICO added, “should arguably have different expectations” about what may be disclosed about them, given their company is “partly funded from the public purse and working in support of an ex-prime minister”.</p> \n<p>The Guardian’s decision to review the Boris Files was based on similar principles. Former prime ministers and their state-subsidised private offices warrant scrutiny. Journalists are not statutory watchdogs, but in a functioning democracy they too have a role to play in holding power to account.</p> \n<p>Journalists must act responsibly, weighing the public interest in the context of legal and ethical considerations. The stories we are publishing from the leak are based on a small proportion of the files.</p> \n<p>The decision to publish them was the result of careful consideration, after concluding that a sufficient public interest threshold had been met.</p> \n<p>Johnson, like Cameron, is no ordinary private citizen. He is a recently departed prime minister who, much like his predecessor, appears to be profiting lavishly from the privileges bestowed on him through public office. The public has a right to know.</p> \n<p><em>The Boris Files reporting team: Harry Davies, Henry Dyer, Pippa Crerar, Tom Burgis, Rowena Mason, Jessica Elgot, Rob Evans, David Pegg and Philip McMahon. </em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Top executives say ministers don’t ‘get’ business, they aren’t listening, and key decisions are fluffed or take too long</p>",
    "content": "<p>It might be tempting, if you are sitting in Downing Street, to dismiss the current pre-budget howls from big business beasts as standard stuff from usual suspects.</p> <p>Archie Norman, the Marks &amp; Spencer chair who <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/10/bosses-urge-starmer-to-ditch-rayner-worker-rights-law/\">told the Telegraph</a> the government’s workers’ rights proposals were “a political indulgence that the country cannot afford”, is a former Tory MP. Stuart Rose, who <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/live-latest-news-uk-companies-ftse-100-shares-vktf35bbt\">told the Times</a> that he believed “we’re genuinely at the edge of a crisis”, is a Tory peer.</p> <p>Rain Newton-Smith, the boss of the CBI, is the country’s top business lobbyist. It should not be remotely surprising that she’s pleading for business to be spared more taxes in the budget, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/rachel-reeves-labour-tax-business-rates-vat\">her argument in the Guardian</a> also carried the provocative advice to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to rethink Labour’s manifesto pledges on tax.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that these grumbles plainly go deeper – well beyond the employment rights package. Talk privately to FTSE 100 and 250 executives and you’ll hear consistent themes: that ministers, despite their pre-election schmoozing to woo the business vote, don’t “get” business; that the government has stopped listening; and that key decisions are fluffed, or take too long.</p> <p>Exhibit A on the last front was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/31/astrazeneca-cancels-speke-project-blaming-cut-in-state-funding\">the collapse in January</a> of AstraZeneca’s intended £450m investment in a vaccine factory in Speke near Liverpool. “Several factors have influenced this decision, including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government’s proposal,” said the company at the time.</p> <p>The Treasury may dispute the account, but the business world (not just a pharmaceutical industry in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/what-is-the-row-between-wes-streeting-and-pharmaceutical-companies-about\">a separate quarrel</a> over the prices the NHS pays for prescription medicines) was amazed that a flagship deal could fall apart at the stage of haggling over details. The government, remember, is still aiming to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/life-sciences-sector-plan-to-grow-economy-and-transform-nhs\">make the UK a “life sciences superpower”</a>.</p> <p>Over in retail-land, a specific grumble is not simply that reform of business rates is taking ages (it always does) but that a simple-sounding proposal to shift some receipts from bricks-and-mortar shops to online premises has morphed into a complicated scrap over the size of premises to be captured by a higher rate. “We still haven’t got a clue where the government is going to end up,” says one executive who met officials in the last month.</p> <p>The “not listening” accusation is echoed even among those with longstanding government contacts. Here’s the chair of one FTSE 100 company: “It feels like they are not even talking to anyone. They’re in a bunker. What you need for growth is some level of confidence in what is about to happen.”</p> <p>The danger, says another executive, is that the government is flying blind: “In the government’s shoes, you’ve got to know which policy ideas on tax will be genuinely damaging and which will cause a fuss but would be stomached.” An increase in levies on banks would fall in the latter category, he suggests, if Reeves is compelled to change some corporate taxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/may/13/reeves-mansion-house-accord-pension-funds\">Reeves’s Mansion House accord on pension funds is long on virtue-signalling | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government gets praise from business on some fronts, it should be said. The overseas trade deals, Reeves’s Mansion House compact, the Treasury’s intervention in the car finance row and the pressure on regulators to be “pro-growth” have gone down well – as you’d expect. Jonathan Reynolds, the business minister until last week, also tended to be viewed positively; so, too, Varun Chandra, Keir Starmer’s business adviser.</p> <p>Yet lack of urgency and lack of coordination across government is a consistent message. “We’ve had the ‘five missions’, the ‘plan for change’ and the ‘three priorities’. It’s just confusing,” says one executive.</p> <p>The turning point in the business mood was, of course, last November’s £40bn tax-raising budget and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/bosses-reeves-tax-rises-employers-national-insurance-contributions\">increase in employers’ national insurance</a>. That was never going to win applause in boardrooms, as Reeves surely knew at the time. But it is also true that efforts to repair relations with business afterwards have dribbled into the sand. Some level of tension between government and business is normal (and too much cosiness is worse), but the current level of distrust feels genuinely unhealthy for investment.</p> <p>Now comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/keir-starmer-tightens-grip-on-economic-policy-by-strengthening-autumn-budget-board\">No 10’s creation of a “budget board”</a>, seemingly intended to avoid another bust-up with business in November. That’s a start, even if nobody pretends there are easy answers when economic forecasts are deteriorating. But a shift in the vibes with business has become urgent. Come 2029, it would be useful to have a few big business figures calling out Reform UK’s fantasy economics.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Great British Beer Festival called off as real ale enthusiasts’ group reports rising costs and stagnant membership</p>",
    "content": "<p>Camra, the real ale enthusiasts’ group, has cancelled Britain’s biggest beer festival amid an existential crisis as it launched a cost-cutting drive to address “budget shortfalls”.</p> <p>In an email to members of the Campaign for Real Ale, seen by the Guardian, the embattled organisation said it was responding to a “stark picture” of its finances, caused by rising costs and stagnant membership numbers.</p> <p>Next year’s Great British Beer Festival, an event that has been running since 1977, will be cancelled along with a counterpart festival held in winter, according to the organisation’s chair, Ash Corbett-Collins.</p> <p>The decision comes after this year’s events failed to attract enough visitors to cover the rising cost of running Camra, accommodating the volunteers who run the event, and hiring venues, resulting in a “substantial loss”.</p>    <p>“We are exploring why these events made a loss and identifying lessons learned,” Corbett-Collins wrote.</p> <p>“Other Camra festivals will continue to be assessed through our usual processes to minimise the risk of loss. Doing nothing is not an option. If we do not act now, the stark reality is we will not exist in the future.”</p> <p>Camra, which is dedicated to the promotion of cask ale and has 145,000 members, said it would launch a three-year strategy and review its internal budgets to ensure its financial viability.</p> <p>“Our activities will be leaner,” said Corbett-Collins. “We must sadly stop supporting the ‘nice to haves’ and instead focus on our key objectives.”</p> <p>Camra, a not-for-profit organisation founded in 1971, usually holds the GBBF in August, as well as a sister event in February.</p> <p>The festival is a key moment in the beer and brewing industry’s calendar, allowing tens of thousands of beer fans to sample about 900 brews, as well as hosting the Champion Beer of Britain awards. This year’s iteration was held at the NEC Birmingham.</p>    <p>The festival is thought to have been called off only four times in nearly 50 years, two of which were in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 1984 event was cancelled due to a fire and the 2024 version was called off after Camra’s chosen venue, Olympia in London, was unavailable.</p> <p>Camra has been keen to move with the times over the years, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/07/camra-calls-time-on-sexist-names-at-great-british-beer-festival\">cracking down on sexist beer names</a> in 2019 and issuing a rallying call to recruit more female beer lovers.</p> <p>Corbett-Collins told members on Wednesday that the organisation would need to “remember our roots but also evolve if we are going to grow in our collective strength and voice”.</p> <p>He told the Guardian on Wednesday evening: “It has been an incredibly difficult announcement to make. The Great British Beer Festival has a rich 50-year history, but we simply did not get the numbers through the door to make it viable. I had to take decisive action to safeguard Camra’s future, but we will not slow our campaigning efforts.</p> <p>“The chancellor must use the autumn budget to support our pubs. We want a cut in VAT and beer duty for pubs, grossly unfair business rates addressed and national insurance contributions eased. Pubs are closing at an alarming rate as the whole beer and pub trade grapples with rising costs and changing trends. Without meaningful government action, our communities risk losing more of their social hubs for good.”</p>",

The share price rose by 2.1% by Wednesday afternoon as investors were cheered by the cost savings</p> <p>Booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had helped Novo Nordisk rise to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/05/weight-loss-novo-nordisk-wegovy-uk\">Europe’s most valuable company</a>, but it lost the title in March, only briefly regaining it in June. </p> <p>Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/13/the-toxic-debate-about-obesity-rages-on-but-at-least-we-know-if-mounjaro-or-wegovy-is-better-for-weight-loss\">Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy</a> in reducing weight. Both can be prescribed by NHS doctors to patients with high clinical need. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. It can be prescribed by private doctors “off label” for weight loss.</p> <p>The drugmaker estimates that the job cuts will save it 8bn kroner (£930m) a year by 2026. However, they will cost 8bn kroner in one-off restructuring charges, prompting the company to cut its operating profit growth forecast for 2025 from 10%-16% to 4%-10%.</p> <p>They are the first major move by Doustdar, <a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessman</a> who took over last month from Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, who had led the company since 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/06/sales-of-novo-nordisk-diabetes-drugs-including-ozempic-slow-sharply\">hinted at redundancies</a> last month.</p> <p>“It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk,” Doustdar said. “We need a shift in our mindset and approach so that we can be faster and more agile.”</p> <p>Novo Nordisk has also had disappointing results for its new obesity drug, CagriSema, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-says-trial-with-next-gen-obesity-drug-diabetics-shows-157-weight-2025-03-10/\">failed to outperform Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro</a> in weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.</p> <p>Sales have also been damaged by “compounding” in the US, where pharmacies make up weight-loss medications from ingredients, a practice that was allowed during drug shortages but was officially ended by the US regulator recently.</p> <p>Jørgensen said last month that the generic, copycat market had “equal size to our business” and that compounded versions of Wegovy were sold at a “much lower price point”.</p> <p>Bank of America analysts said they now expect Novo Nordisk to issue a fourth profit warning when it reports third-quarter results in November, doubting the company can meet the top end of its sales forecast. </p> <p>Along with other European pharmaceutical firms, Novo Nordisk also faces repeated threats from Donald Trump to impose sector-specific tariffs on imports from drugmakers that do not move some of their production to the US.</p> <p>Susannah Streeter, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said: “Novo Nordisk, which had grown fat on the spoils of its weight loss drugs, has been feeling the effects of rivals marching into the space. Uncertainty over American tariffs has also been a risk that continues to cast a shadow over the industry. By becoming a leaner machine, Novo hopes to redirect more funding to R&amp;D to bolster its pipeline of products.”</p> <p>Over the past five years, Novo Nordisk went on a hiring spree, raising employee numbers by 75% as its performance soared because of the global popularity of its weight-loss drugs, which users inject themselves with once a week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/28/weight-loss-drug-mounjaro-uk-price-rise-eli-lilly-pauses-shipments\">Eli Lilly paused UK orders</a> for Mounjaro last month before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/14/eli-lilly-uk-price-weight-loss-jab-mounjaro-trump\">hefty price rises</a> across all doses from 1 September, to prevent inappropriate stockpiling of medicines, it said.</p> <p>It increased the UK list price by up to 170% depending on the dose, although a discount to suppliers has been secured that should limit the impact on consumers, amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/14/eli-lilly-uk-price-weight-loss-jab-mounjaro-trump\">White House push</a> to get drugmakers to raise prices in Europe to enable them to cut high US prices.</p> <p>Mounjaro users were dismayed at the news, worried they would be unable to continue with the medication.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Vodafone has launched a fourth investigation into the historical conduct within its franchising division, which is at the centre of a £120m high court claim against the mobile phone group.</p> <p>Vodafone is also understood to have offered financial settlements to a selection of former franchisees who are outside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/10/vodafone-store-managers-debts-franchise-operators-legal-claim\">the group of 62 currently suing the business</a>.</p> <p>The group of high court claimants – who represent almost 40% of a total 167 Vodafone franchisees – launched a legal case in December alleging Vodafone “unjustly enriched” itself at the expense of scores of vulnerable small business owners by slashing commissions to franchisees running the mobile phone brand’s stores.</p> <p>The new inquiry appears to be the fourth such investigation into the franchising division, after what Vodafone termed “a full assurance review” in 2022 – and then “two investigations to examine complaints raised by franchisees” in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p>Several franchisees have told the Guardian that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/10/vodafone-store-operators-commission-cuts-franchisees\">pressure exerted on them by Vodafone executives triggered suicidal thoughts</a>, while many said they feared losing their livelihoods, homes or life savings after running up personal debts of more than £100,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-02/debates/C0DFB6C5-9907-4241-AA5F-900381038365/CorporateBusinessesAndFranchiseesRegulatoryEnvironment?highlight=vodafone#contribution-98B3856B-5E75-4364-8AC0-9F2B0358702C\">MPs have compared some aspects of the Vodafone dispute</a> with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal.</p> <p>Vodafone has always said it “strongly refutes” the claim that the company “unjustly enriched” itself, but has apologised to the small business owners who once ran its high street shops. “We are sorry to any franchisee that has had a difficult experience,” it said in December.</p> <p>In messages sent over the past week to former franchisees outside the claim, Vodafone asked those “willing to speak to us about these issues” to book a meeting with its “leadership team”.</p> <p>“We have identified that there may be additional historic [sic] issues outstanding with some franchise partners who are not related to the [high court] claim”, the communication said. “Our initial conversations with other exited franchise partners have given us the opportunity to address outstanding issues or concerns that they may have raised.”</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to numerous former Vodafone franchisees outside the group of 62 high court claimants who say they would be willing to join any future claim against the company.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 business, which is <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=VOD%3ALSE\">valued at £21bn on the London stock market</a>, said in December it had made a “number of improvements to our franchise partner programme” after “several in-depth investigations”.</p> <p>It added last year: “We have … made a series of goodwill payments to numerous franchisees. For example, we made the decision to reimburse £4.9m including VAT across our franchise estate.”</p> <p>Court papers filed by the 62 claimants allege that Vodafone acted in “bad faith” by unilaterally cutting fees to its franchisees; imposed swingeing fines on them totalling thousands of pounds for seemingly minor administrative errors; and then cajoled them into taking out loans and government grants to keep their businesses afloat.</p> <p>Vodafone has said it rejects the allegations, which it described as part of a “commercial dispute”.</p> <p>The two sides had previously been in mediation talks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/20/talks-to-settle-120m-legal-claim-against-vodafone-end-without-success\">which collapsed in May</a>. There have also been suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/27/vodafone-whistleblowers-warned-executives-about-plight-of-high-street-store-staff\">whistleblowers warned a series of senior Vodafone executives</a> – including the current chief executive, Margherita Della Valle – that scores of its franchised store owners faced financial ruin about two years before the high court claim.</p> <p>Vodafone, which argues the legal claim is actually worth £85.5m, did not comment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the 62 claimants said they were “gravely concerned” by Vodafone “trying to settle issues … outside the current legal claim”.</p> <p>He added: “If Vodafone is serious about addressing the harm done, it must abandon behind-closed-doors tactics and engage openly with all affected partners.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Companies using different technologies for long-duration storage seek funding as country shifts to renewables and requires greater energy security</p>",
    "content": "<p>Think of battery manufacturing and it may evoke images of Elon Musk and Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/22/trees-cut-down-site-tesla-gigafactory-germany-deforestation\">sprawling “gigafactories”</a> around the globe, or China’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/uk-government-car-battery-industry-gigafactories\">vast, hi-tech clean rooms</a> churning out cells to go in anything from electric toothbrushes to mobile phones and cars. But at Invinity Energy Systems’s small factory in Bathgate, near Edinburgh, workers slotting parts together are hoping that Britain can also play a part in the battery revolution.</p> <p>These batteries, which rely on vanadium ions, are put in 6-metre (20ft), 25-tonne shipping containers. They will not go into cars, but the manufacturer hopes the technology can win a place in a global rush into storage to usher in the shift to net zero carbon grids.</p> <p>Renewable electricity is the future of the global energy system: cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels. However, its main drawback is that renewables generation is tied to the weather, and the sun may not be shining or the wind blowing at the times when energy is most needed. “Time shifting” that energy generation with battery storage, so it can be stored and used later, will be crucial to the proper functioning of electricity grids.</p> <p>“What suddenly started to happen is that people have woken up to realise that energy storage is needed to be able to deploy more renewables on to the grid,” said Jonathan Marren, the Invinity chief executive, at the factory where a row of the batteries is stacked, ready to be shipped.</p> <p>Experts have long been grappling with the different options for storing renewable power, but the issue of the reliability of grids rose up the political agenda in April when Spain and Portugal suffered the biggest blackout in Europe in 20 years. Some people rushed to blame renewable energy, although a Spanish government report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/expert-report-rules-out-cyber-attack-for-spain-and-portugal-april-blackout\">said that was not the case</a>. Nevertheless, battery storage could help grids around the world to avoid Iberian-style chaos.</p>    <p>Much of the focus on battery research has been on cramming as much energy as possible into the smallest, lightest container to go into electric cars. That work has been crucial for the switch away from the carbon pollution from petrol and diesel, a key contributor to global heating. It has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/16/are-electric-cars-too-expensive-to-tempt-motorists-away-from-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\">forced down the cost of lithium ion batteries</a> dramatically.</p> <p>As with much of the transition away from fossil fuels to electric technology, it is China that is driving an increase in demand at an astonishing scale. China has installed batteries with a capacity of 215 gigawatt hours (GWh) – two-thirds of the global total – according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a data company.</p> <p>China’s battery installations are due to nearly quadruple by the end of 2027 to 826GWh, if all planned projects are completed. For instance, the state-owned China Energy Engineering Corporation last month tendered for 25GWh of batteries using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/01/yes-lego-car-why-small-electric-cars-could-be-about-to-break-the-grip-of-suvs\">lithium iron phosphate technology that is being used in cheaper cars</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/archive-zip/giv-32554x1pkNST6lgBv/\" data-alt=\"Global battery storage capacity by country\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/archive-zip/giv-32554x1pkNST6lgBv/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Iola Hughes, the head of research at Rho Motion, a Benchmark subsidiary, said falling prices and the growth of renewable energy were driving the rise in demand. By 2027 total global battery storage installations could increase by five times to 1,500GWh, said Hughes, and “this figure could increase even further as advancements in technology and declining costs allow developers to build battery energy storage systems at a faster pace than historically”.</p> <p>The vast majority of that rise – 95% on current numbers – will be projects using lithium ion batteries such as those being used in Aberdeenshire by Britain’s Zenobē Energy, which installed batteries with a capacity of 600MWh – enough to power all the homes in Scotland for an hour. They claim the site is “Europe’s largest battery”.</p> <p>Energy storage companies using different technologies must now run the brutal gauntlet of finding early stage funding as they try to prove that their technology will be economical. Invinity’s flow batteries use vanadium, while in the US its rival Eos Energy is using zinc. However, flow batteries could find a niche for storage over six to eight hours – more than the two or so hours that lithium batteries tend to provide.</p>    <p>Flow batteries rely on the ability of some metals to exist stably with different numbers of electrons. One shipping container holds two tanks containing vanadium ions with different numbers of electrons – one “royal purple”, the other “Irn-Bru red”. A pump moves the vanadium liquid through a stack of membranes that allow protons to cross, while the electrons are diverted around a circuit, providing power. If electrons are forced in the other direction – by a solar panel or a wind turbine – the reaction moves in reverse, recharging the battery, which can hold 300 kilowatt hours of charge.</p> <p>An important benefit of the flow battery is that it is much simpler to manufacture than lithium ion equivalents. Invinity has been able to make its stacks with 90 employees, mostly based in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/29/grangemouth-refinery-closure-jobs-politics-reform-uk\">part of Scotland that has deindustrialised</a>.</p> <p>Marren claimed that over the project lifetime “on a levelised cost basis, we are better value than lithium”. The upfront cost is still higher than lithium batteries – Invinity hints that it costs above £100,000 for a container – but the batteries last much longer without losing capacity, and are non-flammable, so do not need expensive fire safety equipment. The shipping containers are already sitting beside wave machines in Bristol, car chargers in Oxford, a casino in California and a solar park in South Australia.</p> <p>“We can commission whole sites within days,” Marren said.</p> <p>Invinity is valued at just over £90m on London’s Aim junior stock market, and it is hoping the UK takes a lead in the flow battery niche.</p> <p>British manufacturing could count in its favour in a government competition for support under a “cap and floor” scheme that will guarantee electricity prices within a set range – removing the risk from a sustained fall in prices. If successful, the company would require a big production expansion from the current ability to make five containers a week, Marren said. He dreams of employing 1,000 workers if the company takes off.</p> <p>“The potential for expansion is enormous,” Marren said. “We’ve gone past the stage of ‘does the tech work at scale’? We’ve got a long-duration storage that works.”</p>",

Should spotting it prove difficult, there are myriad apps that can pinpoint its position.</p> <p>Those hoping to spot the transit of Titan will need a telescope. “It is quite a challenge, you are looking at a small dot moving in front of a bigger dot, but … it is technically possible,” Bloomer said. The transit is expected shortly before dawn in the UK on 20 September. </p> <p>Bloomer said viewing Saturn and other objects in the night sky helped people to see for themselves the mechanics of the solar system. “Planets in particular, they shift relative to the background of stars,” he said.</p> <p>Dr James O’Donoghue, an expert in planetary astronomy at the University of Reading, said he had shown people Saturn through a telescope for the first time perhaps 50 to 100 times. “Sometimes people are 70 years old before they’ve seen it like that,” he said. “And I can’t see [because] it’s dark outside, but I’m sure the hairs are standing up on the back of their necks.”</p> <p>O’Donoghue said the fifth planet from the sun was particularly special. “Saturn is the jewel of the solar system. I know that everyone has said that but I truly believe it is. And I think it is more than that: I think it’s actually a symbol of science.”</p> <p>The Saturn system is unusual as Titan – a moon often visible as a bright pinprick of light next to the planet – is thought to have <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/facts/\">liquid water</a> underground, as well as <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/astrobiology/path-toward-protocells-on-titan/\">lakes and seas of methane and ethane</a> on its surface, making it a key contender for harbouring life.</p> <p>O’Donoghue said that as well as prompting many questions, gazing up at the cosmos helped people gain perspective. “We all have a lot of struggles all the time,” he said. “I’d say it’s looking at the bigger picture, but it is the biggest picture, and I think it’s actually pretty good for mental health.” </p> <p>While light pollution means swaths of humanity can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution\">no longer see the Milky Way</a>, Saturn is one of the planets that can easily be seen with the naked eye.</p> <p>Lintott said: “Some of the most memorable moments of my life have been under dark skies, staring in awe and wonder at the Milky Way with my jaw on the floor. So a dark sky is an amazing thing and we should care about light pollution.</p> <p>“But on an average Tuesday you can see the moon and you can see the planets just as well from the middle of London, or the middle of Oxford or the middle of Edinburgh or wherever it is, as you can from up a hill in the middle of the Lake District or a dark sky site.”</p> <h2>Other celestial events this autumn</h2>    <p><strong>29 October – catch sight of Mercury<br></strong>Mercury is a tricky, and potentially dangerous, planet to see as it is the closest to the sun. However, with its greatest distance east from the Earth’s star expected to occur again on 29 October, it will appear low on the horizon as the sun is setting and may be visible to the naked eye. “It’ll be quite a challenge, and basically a viewer would have about half an hour to see it, with a perfectly flat horizon,” Bloomer said. “Doable, but challenging.”</p> <p><strong>17 and 18 November – spot some shooting stars<br></strong>Active throughout most of November, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/14/starwatch-high-speed-leonids-meteor-shower-bright-colourful\">Leonid meteor shower</a> peaks in the middle of the month. The celestial show occurs as Earth passes through a trail of debris left by the comet Tempel-Tuttle that orbits the sun every 33 years.</p> <p><strong>21 November – glimpse Uranus<br></strong>Uranus is often difficult to see with the naked eye, appearing only faintly in the night sky. However, when Uranus is in opposition, meaning Earth sits between the planet and the sun, it is at its most visible. Bloomer recommends heading to a dark spot with clear skies. And unless you have excellent eyesight, you may want some kit. “Binoculars or small telescope recommended!” he said.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Surface spots and nodules on rocks in ancient river valley are described in new study as ‘potential biosignatures’</p>",
    "content": "<p>Unusual features found in rocks on Mars may be the handiwork of ancient microbial life that eked out an existence on the red planet billions of years ago.</p> <p>The rocks were spotted by Nasa’s Perseverance rover as it trundled along Neretva Vallis, an ancient river valley that was carved into the landscape by water flowing into the Jezero crater in the planet’s distant past.</p> <p>The rover, which touched down in Jezero crater in 2021, encountered the rocks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/26/nasa-rover-discovery-hints-at-ancient-microbial-life-on-mars\">last year</a> as it explored an outcrop called the Bright Angel formation on the northern edge of the ancient valley.</p> <p>“This very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars,” Sean Duffy, Nasa’s acting administrator, told a press conference at the space agency’s Washington DC headquarters on Wednesday.</p> <p>Instruments onboard the rover detected signs of carbon-based compounds in the rocks, while images captured intriguing surface spots and nodules that are often associated with microbial life on Earth.</p> <p>The unusual features may have prosaic origins in the form of chemical reactions that played out over millennia. But in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09413-0\">report published in Nature on Wednesday</a>, the findings of which were discussed at the press conference, scientists say the features should be regarded as potential signs of life.</p> <p>“Our analysis leads us to conclude that the Bright Angel formation contains textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as ‘potential biosignatures’,” they write.</p> <p>“It’s a signature. It’s a sort of leftover sign. It’s not life itself. And it certainly could have been from ancient life, and that would have been something that was there billions of years ago, nothing that’s currently there,” Dr Nicky Fox, associate administrator of Nasa’s science mission directorate, told reporters.</p> <p>Still, she said: “We’re kind of one step closer to answering one of humanity’s most profound questions, and that is: are we truly alone in the universe?”</p> <p>While Mars appears an arid world today, its surface is crossed and dotted with ancient river and lake beds, pointing to a warmer, wetter past. If life ever gained a foothold on the planet, traces may be found in its rocks as organic matter and possibly even fossilised organisms.</p> <p>Dr Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist and planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, and first author on the paper, said the unusual features on the rocks were accumulations of minerals, including an iron-phosphate mineral, vivianite, and an iron sulphide mineral, greigite.</p> <p>“These minerals appear to have formed as a result of reactions between the mud of the Bright Angel formation and organic matter that is also present in that mud,” he said. The reactions appeared to have taken place shortly after the mud was deposited on the lake bed.</p> <p>On Earth, reactions that combine organic matter and chemical compounds in mud to form new minerals, such as vivianite and greigite, are often driven by microbial activity. The microbes consume the organic compounds and produce the minerals as a byproduct of their metabolism.</p> <p>But there are other ways to produce the minerals. “The reason … we cannot claim this is more than a potential biosignature is that there are chemical processes that can cause similar reactions in the absence of biology and we cannot rule those processes out completely on the basis of rover data alone,” Hurowitz said.</p> <p>Hurowitz added: “We should be conservative and stick to the potential biosignature designation until future research and analysis on the sample collected from this geological formation can be performed on Earth.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/16/mars-meteorite-largest-auction\">Largest piece of Mars on Earth sells for over $5m at New York auction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers hope the findings will kickstart efforts in laboratories to see if the intriguing features can be recreated through biological and non-biological processes. They also want it to spur fieldwork at sites where similar reactions may have taken place in the past.

    "description": "<p>Heidi Liddle told inquiry she felt ‘crushing’ guilt, while Leanne Lucas said she felt ‘ostracised’ from community</p>",
    "content": "<p>A dance teacher who led the Taylor Swift-themed children’s workshop which was attacked in Southport has described feeling “tortured” by a “crushing” guilt over the atrocity.</p> <p>Heidi Liddle, who shielded one little girl inside a bathroom during the attack, said the trauma of that day had “fractured every part of my brain and my life”.</p> <p>In tearful testimony to the inquiry being held at Liverpool town hall, Liddle said: “Although people have told me this incident is not my fault, the guilt I bear is crushing. I feel responsible.</p>    <p>“I tried so hard to usher as many children out as possible, to get them away from him [the attacker]. I constantly replay what happened over and over in my mind, what I was able to do, what else could I have done, the what ifs.”</p> <p>Her friend Leanne Lucas, with whom she led the workshop, said survival instincts had guided her decision to rush out of the building with children.</p> <p>Lucas, 35, phoned 999 in the “absolute chaos” of trying to escape after Axel Rudakubana stabbed her five times, fracturing her shoulder blade and cutting off parts of her spine. She fell unconscious from her injuries after calling for help.</p> <p>Occasionally breaking to stop her tears, the former primary school teacher said: “I acted in a way to find help as quickly as possible. Living with that knowledge is hard.”</p> <p>Since the attack, Lucas said, she had felt “ostracised” in Southport, her home town, and felt exposed and criticised for her actions: “To some I am called a hero, to others a villain. The truth is, I am neither. I am just Leanne, the woman who did her best in an unthinkable situation.”</p> <p>The attack had left her “excluded from parts of my own community”, she said, adding that she stayed away from events because her presence could distress the families of the children.</p> <p>Lucas added: “I don’t heal alongside or within my community. I feel ostracised in the very town where I built my life.”</p> <p>The inquiry, led by the former appeal court judge Sir Adrian Fulford, is examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six; Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven; and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine; and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.</p>    <p>Liddle, who was returning to work from maternity leave at the time, described how she frantically tried to usher children to safety as Rudakubana rained down blows with a 20cm (8in) kitchen knife.</p> <p>She saw Lucas being “brutally attacked” and ran with some of the girls to the stairway. One of the children, she noticed, had run in the opposite direction towards a toilet, so she quickly opened the door and locked them both inside.</p> <p>“Whilst in the toilet, the perpetrator was banging and rattling the door attempting to get in – only stopping when the police arrived,” she said. “The girls’ screaming and fearing for our lives haunts me to this day.”</p> <p>Through tears, the mother of two told the inquiry that she responded in a split second to the “most horrendous and terrifying situation I’ve ever been in, one I had never even imagined possible”.</p> <p>She added: “My instinct was to protect all of the girls; despite this, a part of me always questions if we could have done anything differently in those moments of terror.”</p> <p>Liddle said she felt her experience had been diminished during the police investigation as she was treated as a witness rather than a victim.</p> <p>She said: “Whilst I will always consider other people’s experiences and feelings that day above my own, this labelling made me feel like my own experience was immaterial, trivial or even worthless.” </p> <p>The inquiry continues.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The publisher of the Washington Post, Will Lewis, is facing fresh questions over his independence after a cache of leaked files revealed he gave extensive support to Boris Johnson as a secret political adviser when Johnson was prime minister.</p> \n<p>The files shed light on how the media executive, who at the time was vice-chair of the Associated Press news agency, worked behind the scenes with Johnson as his premiership was engulfed by a series of scandals.</p> \n<p>Lewis’s meetings with Johnson, which took place over a six-month period in 2022, were not disclosed in official transparency records, in an apparent breach of government rules.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-elon-musk-evening-standard-evgeny-lebedev\">Revealed: Boris Johnson approached Elon Musk on behalf of London Evening Standard owner Lebedev</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In July 2022, on the eve of Johnson’s announcement that he would resign from government, Lewis spent the day in 10 Downing Street and worked closely with Johnson and his advisers.</p> \n<p>Lewis appears to have arrived early in the morning, at 7.50am, and took part in at least six meetings during the day, including a gathering of Johnson’s aides to prepare him for prime minister’s questions (PMQs) in the House of Commons.</p> \n<p>In the meetings, which stretched into the evening, Lewis appears to have participated in gatherings of Johnson’s closest political allies, including several MPs and a senior minister, as the prime minister came under intense pressure to step down.</p> \n<p>Details of the extent of Lewis’s support for Johnson are revealed in official government logs that provide a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities. The logs are marked “official – sensitive”.</p> \n<p>The records are contained in the Boris Files, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">cache of documents</a> obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks, and seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>According to the files, Lewis spoke or met with the prime minister on at least 11 occasions between February and July 2022. In total, Lewis appears to have provided Johnson with at least 15 hours of political advice during this period.</p> \n<p>The exposure of the meetings raises questions for Lewis about his proximity to political power and whether his role advising a serving UK prime minister amounted to a conflict of interest with his role at AP.</p> \n<p>It also places a spotlight on Lewis’s relationship with Johnson, who nominated the media executive for a knighthood for “political and public service” after leaving office.</p> \n<p>Lewis was editor of the Daily Telegraph in the 2000s when Johnson was a columnist for the paper. Lewis then spent a decade at companies controlled by Rupert Murdoch, including the UK-based News Group Newspapers (NGN) when it was dealing with allegations of past phone hacking.</p> \n<p>His tenure at the Washington Post has been mired in controversy after allegations recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-company-ngn-actively-frustrated-met-phone-hacking-investigation-will-lewis\">emerged in court proceedings</a> that he was involved in an effort by NGN to “actively frustrate” a police inquiry into phone hacking. Lewis and NGN have strongly denied the allegations.</p> \n<p>A source close to Lewis said he “has been transparent about his personal relationship” with Johnson.</p> \n<p>An AP spokesperson said its board members provided oversight of AP’s executive leadership and had “no involvement” in its journalism. “Board directors hold a wide range of roles outside of AP,” they said.</p> \n<p>A Cabinet Office source said it was Johnson’s responsibility “to account for his meetings”. The former prime minister did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<h2>Frequent visitor</h2> \n<p>It has previously been reported that Lewis <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/paralysed-in-no-10-are-the-pm-and-his-wife-ready-to-let-it-go-2kdcnrhss\">provided informal advice</a> to Johnson. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/19/will-lewis-washington-post-publisher-boris-johnson-partygate\">reported last year</a> that he allegedly advised Johnson to “clean up” phone data relating to the Covid-19 rule-breaking scandal known as Partygate.</p> \n<p>Under ministerial rules, Johnson would have been expected to disclose any meeting held with a senior media executive, but Lewis does not appear in public transparency records.</p> \n<p>The omission has meant that the extent of Lewis’s involvement in shaping Johnson’s response to a rolling series of scandals that would end his term as prime minister was unknown until now.</p> \n<p>According to the leaked minute-by-minute logs, Lewis was a frequent visitor at Downing Street and Chequers, the prime minister’s official countryside residence, as Johnson fought in vain to save his premiership in 2022.</p> \n<p>Lewis first appears in the logs on 2 February when he joined a call with Johnson and a Conservative political strategist. After four of Johnson’s senior aides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark\">quit the next day</a>,<strong> </strong>Lewis joined several meetings in Downing Street on 4 February and he appears to have spent a part of the morning alone with the prime minister.</p> \n<p>At the time, Johnson was facing calls to resign amid dissent within his own party and a widening police investigation into lockdown-breaking parties.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">What are the Boris Files and what do they reveal about former PM’s conduct?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Johnson was able to withstand the pressure for several months longer, but in early July he became embroiled in a fresh scandal, sparking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/05/sajid-javid-and-rishi-sunak-quit-throwing-boris-johnsons-future-into-doubt\">resignations of two</a> of his most senior ministers.</p> \n<p>The day after, on 6 July, Lewis joined the prime minister’s first meeting of the day along with Ross Kempsell, then a close ally and political fixer to Johnson.</p> \n<p>Lewis remained at the prime minister’s side that morning. In the logs, officials recorded that Johnson was “in office with Will Lewis (vice-chair of the Associated Press)” along with two loyal ministers.</p> \n<p>Lewis attended additional meetings in Downing Street during the day as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/06/johnson-clings-on-amid-cabinet-standoff-and-dozens-of-resignations\">ministers quit</a> Johnson’s government en masse. He was also with Johnson in the evening as the prime minister and his advisers tried to salvage his position.</p> \n<p>On 7 July, Lewis again joined Johnson’s first meeting of the day, according to the logs, hours before the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/boris-johnson-resigns-as-conservative-leader-after-cabinet-revolt\">publicly announced</a> he would resign. Lewis continued to advise Johnson in the following days as the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/18/boris-johnson-defends-record-as-government-faces-confidence-vote\">faced a vote</a> of no confidence.</p> \n<p>He returned to Downing Street as Johnson prepared for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/20/tory-mps-indulge-in-a-mawkish-farewell-for-their-poundshop-arnie\">final appearance</a> as prime minister in the House of Commons.

He said: “Stop going on social media, invite us to the meeting, let’s have a discussion, because I want to know what is going on in London.”</p> <p>He warned further strikes could follow. Speaking earlier to the BBC, he said: “We’ve got towards the end of a week of strike action, we’re open to negotiations, but there are no invitations to sit down with TfL. We’ll have to see what the next move is.”</p> <p>Dempsey said the RMT wanted to make “meaningful progress” towards its 32-hour week ambition and was prepared to “compromise and discuss” in negotiations.</p> <p>A TfL spokesperson said talks had not taken place as the RMT’s demand for a reduction in the working week had been ruled out as impractical and unaffordable.</p>    <p>Some of the gridlock seen during pre-Covid tube strikes was averted as commuters worked from home and used the Elizabeth line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/crossrail-elizabeth-line-opens-first-trains-london\">opened in 2022</a>. Growing numbers have also turned to bikes to navigate London’s congested roads – and even boats, avoiding the streets.</p> <p>Buses, the Elizabeth line and London Overground have taken on much of the strain, collectively carrying about 1 million extra passengers daily, according to TfL’s contactless data. Overall usage of TfL’s modes has been down about 20% compared with normal numbers, with many people either staying home or cycling.</p> <p>The capital’s ebike providers have been big beneficiaries of the strikes and an invaluable aid on gridlocked roads towards central London.</p> <p> Lime said it had an upsurge of 78% more hires than the previous Wednesday. Forest reported Tuesday morning rush-hour rides at four times normal levels and 20,000 new app downloads on Monday alone.</p> <p>TfL said its Santander cycle scheme also saw a surge with almost 20,000 hires by 3pm, up 93% on the usual figure.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Uber-branded Thames Clipper boats reported total passenger numbers up 66% on Tuesday compared with a week earlier.</p> <p>Most businesses, however, will be counting the cost. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank estimates the strikes dealt a £230m blow to the economy, excluding indirect effects such as lost productivity and lower retail spending. The Night Time Industries Association claimed the strikes could cost the leisure and entertainment sector £150m.</p> <p>Footfall in some of London’s main work and retail centres had fallen by almost a third, according to O2 mobile phone data. It said footfall across central London on Tuesday lunchtime was down 16% compared with a week earlier, with Canary Wharf down 31% and London Bridge and the City down 21%.</p> <p>TfL has advised passengers to check daily for service updates. A full tube service is not expected until 8am on Friday morning.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Snapchat has been accused by a Danish research organisation of leaving an “overwhelming number” of drug dealers to openly operate on Snapchat, making it easy for children to buy substances including cocaine, opioids and MDMA.</p> <p>The social media platform has said it proactively uses technology to filter out profiles selling drugs. However, research by Digitalt Ansvar (Digital Accountability), a Danish research organisation that promotes responsible digital development, has found evidence of a failure to moderate drug-related language in usernames. It also accused Snapchat of failing to respond adequately to reports of profiles openly selling drugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/10/controls-privacy-buy-childs-first-mobile-phone-safety\">Set controls and teach privacy: how to manage your child’s first mobile phone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Researchers used profiles of 13-year-olds and found a multitude of people selling drugs on Snapchat under usernames featuring keywords such as “coke”, “weed” and “molly”. When researchers reported 40 of these profiles to Snapchat, the company removed only 10 of them. The other 30 reports were rejected, they said.</p> <p>Snapchat said it had “proactively disabled” 75% of the accounts reported and had now disabled all of them.</p> <p>The investigation also found that despite previous criticism, Snapchat’s recommendation systems were spreading and promoting profiles of those selling illegal drugs to users – including to children who had not previously shown an interest in or interacted with drug-dealing profiles.</p> <p>Within a few hours, the researchers’ 13-year-old test profiles had recommendations to add up to 70 suspected drug-dealing profiles because one friend was connected to a drug-dealing profile.</p> <p>Digitalt Ansvar’s CEO, Ask Hesby Holm, said: “As a child or young person, you don’t need to search for these profiles yourself; you can have them recommended directly by Snapchat. That is deeply problematic.</p> <p>“Snapchat itself says they proactively use technology to filter out profiles that sell drugs on the platform. Our investigation shows this is not true. Snapchat hosts an overwhelming number of openly drug-related profiles and appears not to moderate either implicit or explicit drug-related language in usernames.”<br><br>This failure to moderate profiles with such obvious usernames, he said, meant that “children and young people have very easy access to buying drugs on Snapchat”. He added: “It’s not technology that’s lacking, it is will. Snapchat can easily filter such usernames.”</p> <p>According to Snapchat, in 2023 it had a 90% reach of 13- to 24-year-olds in the Nordics. Digitalt Ansvar accused Snapchat of breaking EU rules for digital services on the protection of children and called for authorities to act.</p> <p>A Snapchat spokesperson said: “We have zero tolerance for drug sales on Snapchat. Even though the accounts flagged in the study were not all reported in-app, more than 75% of those accounts had already been disabled by our teams before we were made aware of this report, and all accounts now have been.</p> <p>“At Snapchat, we are working diligently and have invested tremendous resources to stop drug dealers from abusing our platform. We deploy proactive detection to identify and disable these accounts, support law enforcement to bring dealers to justice, and educate our community about the dangers of drugs. Over the past year, we have proactively consulted law enforcement across Europe to identify new search terms and emojis used by criminals, aiming to enhance our proactive detection and maintain a hostile environment to drug dealers.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>The chief executive of the Kingsmill owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has warned Rachel Reeves not to give consumer sentiment “another whack” in her upcoming budget, despite signalling that food price rises had peaked and will now start to ease.</p> <p>George Weston, the chief executive of the ABF conglomerate which also owns the fashion chain Primark and produces sugar and cooking ingredients, said recent food price inflation had been driven by employers passing on increases to labour costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">announced in Reeves’ first budget as chancellor</a> last year.</p> <p>He said most retailers had now passed these costs on and “food inflation will be gradually easing from now” as the cost of commodities was “pretty benign”.</p>    <p>Grocery inflation stood at 5% in August, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">latest data</a> from analysts Worldpanel, contributing to wider inflation, which rose to 3.8% in July.</p> <p>He added that Primark had not raised clothing prices in a year as it had been able to offset higher labour costs with more technology, such as self-service tills and lower freight and cotton prices.</p> <p>Weston said given the higher food prices, Primark’s shoppers had kept a tighter rein on spending than more affluent consumers.</p> <p>“We had to work very hard to earn our shoppers’ money, as we are not in an easy consumer environment,” he said, with sales in the UK and Ireland rising by 1% over the six months to 13 September, helped by new store openings.</p> <p>But shares in ABF slid more than 13% on Wednesday as analysts said trading at Primark’s mainland Europe outlets had been worse than hoped. The company also warned that sugar profits would be below expectations. ABF’s sugar business, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/uks-largest-bioethanol-plant-to-shut-after-blow-from-starmers-trade-deal-with-trump\">closing Vivergo ethanol plant</a>, is also likely to make a £40m loss, much deeper than feared.</p> <p>The company said group sales are expected to have fallen by 2% at established Primark stores in the six months to 13 September, with sales flat at established UK stores and sales falls in Germany, France and Italy.</p> <p>Weston blamed “political turmoil” in France, which was the worst performing country, and consumer uncertainty elsewhere in Europe amid the Ukraine war and inflation.</p> <p>Weston said Primark was “trading very strongly” as a seasonal change in the weather had led to demand for warmer clothing and it had sharpened up its fashion ranges, particularly on denim.</p> <p>He said that Primark continued to gain market share in a flat UK market despite heavy competition from Shein, the Chinese-founded online fashion seller.</p> <p>Many retailers fear Reeves will impose further tax increases on businesses in her 26 November budget. Weston said: “I hope consumer sentiment doesn’t take another great whack in November … anything that reduces returns on investment or increases the costs of employing people [could affect sentiment]”.</p> <p>Weston said he would like to see Reeves’ November budget “closing that big loophole around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/06/shein-uk-singapore-tax-fashion\">de minimis”</a> – a tax break that allows Shein and others to import items worth less than £135 direct to consumers without paying customs duty.</p> <p>“I don’t like to be faced with competition that has an unfair advantage which could be costing the Treasury maybe £100m a year,” he said. “A lot of money is being left on the table unnecessarily.”</p> <p>He also called on the chancellor to revise plans to increase business rates for large high street stores.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Police investigating incidents as racially motivated hate crimes after drivers forced to flee</p>",
    "content": "<p>A group of men in Belfast have surrounded and attacked two cars and forced their drivers to flee in suspected racially motivated hate crimes.</p> \n<p>At least a dozen men, some masked, targeted the motorists on Monday evening near Connswater retail park in what appeared to be the latest incident in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/21/everyone-is-scared-vigilantes-ignite-race-hate-fears-on-streets-of-belfast\">vigilante campaign</a> against migrants in the east of the city.</p> \n<p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was investigating both incidents as racially motivated hate crimes.</p> \n<p>Northern Ireland’s justice minister, Naomi Long, said anti-migrant sentiment in the region was growing and that racism and sectarianism were linked. “I would also urge people not to get involved in this despicable behaviour,” she said. “You will be held to account and the penalties could include a prison sentence. As a society, we must not stand by and tolerate racism or intimidation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1784eb7a-24e3-435d-8c3a-2f984cdb9905\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2rL8HddZIeI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Shortly before the incidents a crowd had gathered at the retail park to protest against the prosecution of a man charged with inciting hatred earlier this month.</p> \n<p>Video footage shared on social media showed a group surrounding a silver-coloured car at Factory Street, adjacent to the retail park.</p> \n<p>Police said the driver left the vehicle “in fear” and that the crowd reportedly damaged it. “A further report was received that the driver of a navy-coloured car was confronted by the group but managed to drive off. There were no reports to any injuries to the driver or damage to the vehicle at this time,” the PSNI said.</p> \n<p>Officers had gathered evidence and would review the video footage to determine whether any offences had been committed, police said. “There will be an increased policing presence in the area, with officers continuing to engage with relevant partner agencies.”</p> \n<p>Police said “self-appointed patrols”, a reference to vigilantes, would not be tolerated.</p> \n<p>Deirdre Hargey, a Sinn Féin assembly member, called the incidents deplorable. “This is yet another example of the disgusting, sporadic racist violence which we have seen across the city,” she said.</p> \n<p>A simmering campaign against foreigners and people of colour in Belfast and other parts of county Antrim has escalated since the anti-migrant riots in England last year.</p> \n<p>Groups have put up threatening posters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/04/catholic-and-african-residents-targeted-by-paint-bombs-in-county-antrim\">smashed property</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/19/ballymena-impact-anti-migrant-riots-northern-ireland\">burned homes</a>, forcing families to flee. A group of vigilantes calling itself the Belfast Nightwatch First Division and styling itself as a defender of women and children, challenges dark-skinned men to produce identity documents and explanations for their presence in the east of the city.</p> \n<p>The Belfast Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/thug-who-stabbed-child-is-part-of-far-right-save-our-children-vigilante-group-in-east-belfast/a486511336.html\">reported on Wednesday</a> that one of the vigilantes had been convicted of the attempted murder of a 14-year-old child, another was a convicted loyalist killer, and a third was a convicted armed robber.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Number of attempts to cross Channel has been particularly high for several days, say French authorities</p>",
    "content": "<p>Four people including two children have died in two separate incidents while trying to cross the Channel to the UK in the past 24 hours, while three others are missing in a third incident.</p> <p>On Tuesday night off the coast of Sangatte, France, three people lost their lives while travelling on a dinghy with 38 people onboard. Three others are missing after an incident in Neufchâtel-Hardelot, France, on a boat with 115 people onboard.</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon a woman was confirmed dead after a rescue attempt on the UK side of the Channel. The woman was airlifted to Dover but her life could not be saved.</p> <p>The deaths come days after the former home secretary Yvette Cooper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/01/women-children-home-office-refugee-family-reunions-uk-politics-live-latest-updates-news\">announced</a> the suspension of refugee family reunion, a safe route used mainly by women and children to reunite with immediate family members granted refugee status in the UK.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the first forced removals of small boat arrivals under the Anglo-French “one in, one out” deal are due to take place on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week on Air France flights.</p> <p>The plan proposes that for each migrant the UK returns to France, another person with a strong case for asylum in Britain will be allowed to stay.</p> <p>About 100 people were thought to have been detained for the “out” part of the deal, including victims of trafficking and torture, as well as children who were wrongly classified as adults and were later released.</p> <p>Those detained include people from conflict zones such as Sudan, Libya and Eritrea. Speaking from a detention centre on Wednesday, one person from Eritreasaid: “Everybody has been crying since we received the letters telling us when we will be sent to France. It is a punishment to be sent there.”</p> <p>According to the French authorities, Channel crossing attempts have been particularly high for several days along the Boulogne coast. On Sunday, 1,097 people crossed the Channel to the UK in 17 boats.</p> <p>French media outlet La Voix Du Nord has reported that of the three people confirmed dead, two are from Vietnam and one is Egyptian.</p> <p>Laurent Touvet, préfet of Pas-de-Calais, said it was “a difficult and tragic night” and added: “Smuggler networks bear the responsibility for these tragedies. The state is determined to combat them.”</p> <p>However, NGOs working with people in northern France hoping to cross the Channel to the UK take a different view.</p> <p>Lachlan Macrae of Calais Food Collective said: “These crossings are becoming deadlier in large part due to increased policing on the French side and a lack of safe routes to the UK. People trying to cross are now hiding their lifejackets in bin bags or under blankets to avoid being targeted by the French police. Responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the UK and French governments.”</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “Four people dying in the Channel in the past 24 hours, including two children, is another heartbreaking and needless loss of life.</p> <p>“People only risk crossing the Channel when what they are fleeing is more terrifying than the dangers ahead. Every day, our frontline teams meet men, women and children who had no choice but to flee their homes in war-torn countries and leave everything behind in search of safety, even if that meant separating from their families.”</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/europe?region_incident=All&amp;route=3896&amp;incident_date%5Bmin%5D=&amp;incident_date%5Bmax%5D=\">International Organisation for Migration</a>, 85 people died trying to cross the Channel in 2024, and from the beginning of 2025 until 15 August, a further 24 deaths were recorded.</p> <p>Thousands of people have crossed the Channel in small boats since the “one in, one out” agreement with France took effect in August, according to Home Office figures. </p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: “We are aware of reports of an incident in the Channel in French territorial waters. French authorities are leading the response and investigation. We will not be commenting further at this stage.”</p> <p>More than 30,000 people have reached the UK in small boats so far in 2025, and more than 50,000 have crossed since Labour came into power in July 2024.</p>",

Compared to a year earlier, producer prices were up by 2.6%.</p> <p>The core measure, excluding food and energy which can be volatile, also fell by 0.1% in August from the previous month, while economists had expected a 0.3% gain.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Brown</strong>, deputy chief North America economist at Capita Economics, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The downside surprise to the PPI in August was driven by a compression of trade margins, reversing their unexpected widening in July, and therefore overstates the softness of producer prices. Nonetheless, the big picture remains that tariff effects are feeding through only slowly…</p> <p>There is little for the Fed to worry about in terms of the PPI components that feed into the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] deflator, which were on the whole in line with their averages in recent months. Accordingly, ahead of the more important consumer prices index release tomorrow, our preliminary estimate is that the core PCE deflator rose by 0.25% month on month. That would be above the target-consistent rate of roughly 0.17% m/m and might, at the margin at least, quell talk of a 50bp [interest rate] cut next week. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68c166e98f08d80fd0f1141d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-10T11:58:16.984Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Peter Kyle in Beijing for UK's first trade talks with China in seven years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The newly appointed business secretary, <strong>Peter Kyle</strong>, is in Beijing for the UK’s first trade talks with the country in seven years in an attempt to revitalise economic relations.</p> <p>As part of a two day programme he held a bilateral with <strong>Li Lecheng</strong>, the minister of industry and information technology on Wednesday morning as part of a revived industrial cooperation dialogue, a Sino-British relationship format that has not sat since 2022.</p> <p>The ministry is responsible for industrial policy but also telecoms and the internet, which is heavily censored in China.</p> <p>Tomorow Kyle, who was only promoted to the post on Friday, will have a day long programme with China’s long-standing commerce minister <strong>Wang Wentao</strong> including a bilateral in the morning, followed by a meeting of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission (Jetco) which has not sat for seven years.</p> <p>It will end with a joint dinner where the ministers will be joined by Chinese and British businesses.</p> <p>Kyle is the ninth government representative to visit China since Labour were elected to power last year with hopes that the trip will unlock an export market worth more than £1bn over five years, according to a statement from the department for business and trade.</p>    <p>Restarting trade talks with China was “an essential tool to put money into people’s pockets,” said Kyle.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ahead of the Jetco meeting, the department for business and trade (DBT) unveiled <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-wins-to-china-2024-to-2025-confirmed-results\">new deals and market openings for British interests worth £2bn</a>.</p> <p>These include a new three-season TV deal for the Premier League and marketing opportunities for companies ranging from <strong>Eve Lom</strong> cosmetics to <strong>Hayman’s</strong> gin distillery and <strong>Aedas</strong> architecture firm which has previously been involved in buildings such as Kong Kong’s West Kowloon rail station and the giant Sina Plaza science park in Beijing.</p> <p>The department also pointed to China being a “huge market” for British cars and for porcine genetics, a pig breeding programme, cattle hides and sheep skins.</p> <p>The UK is looking to China to achieve much-needed economic growth but so far the trading relationship does not reflect the size of the country.</p> <p><strong>Sam Goodman</strong>, senior policy director at Chinese Strategic Risks Institute, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The export wins DBT secured in the last year with China and Hong Kong accounts less 0.2% of total annual UK exports.

One US official said, according to the FT:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’re ready to go, ready to go right now, but we’re only going to do this if our European partners step up with us.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meanwhile, Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk announced that it will cut 9,000 jobs and trimmed its profit forecast for this year, as it struggles against competition from US rival Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight loss injection.</strong></p> <p>The job cuts amount to 11% of the drugmaker’s workforce of 78,400. About 5,000 of the job losses will happen in Denmark.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916424#\">Novo Nordisk said the move would save 8bn Danish kroner</a> (£930m) a year, although it will also lead to one-off costs of 8bn kroner this year. As a result, it expects to deliver operating profit growth of 4% to 10% at constant exchange rates, down from 10%—16%.</p> <p>It is the first major move by <strong><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">Mike Doustdar</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/latest-news/meet-mike-doustdar.html\">, an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessman</a>, who took over as chief executive last month. Novo Nordisk – which had become Europe’s most valuable company on the back of the weight loss drug boom – recently lost two thirds of its market value following disappointing drug trial results and slowing sales.</p> <p>Doustdar said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-<br>driven. Our company must evolve as well.</p> <p>It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy in reducing weight. Novo’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p> <p><strong>Asian stock markets rose while government bonds fell, after weaker US labour market data heightened expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut of at least a quarter point next week.</strong></p> <p>Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.87% higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed by 1.1% and South Korea’s Kospi rose by 1.67%.</p> <p>US government bonds fell for a second day on Wednesday, pushing yields higher.

The whistleblowers say company managers instructed staff to avoid research that might show evidence of child harm in virtual reality.</p> <p>In one instance, a researcher was reportedly told to “swallow that ick”.</p> <p>In another instance, a researcher was allegedly told to delete information from an interview they had conducted with a German family, according to the Washington Post.

    "content": "<p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> debuted its<strong> </strong>latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> on Tuesday, trumpeting the smartphone’s slimmest design yet.<strong> </strong>The device, named the iPhone Air, is one of several upgrades the company unveiled<strong> </strong>at its annual product showcase, promoted with the title “awe-dropping”. The event kicked off at 10am PT with the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, speaking in front of its Cupertino headquarters.</p> <p>“Design is at the core of everything we do,” Cook said. The CEO touted the company’s thin iPhone, which sports a width of 5.6mm, as the “biggest leap ever” for the device, which first debuted in 2007. Cook said that Apple had set a “new standard” for the gadget industry back then and “today we’re raising the bar once again” with its iPhone 17 lineup.</p> <p>The skinny phone is made of “spacecraft titanium”, has a 6.5in display and comes in a palette of colors that “evoke lightness”, the company says. Apple executives who spoke at Tuesday’s event promised that, despite the phone’s thinness, it will be durable and crack-resistant. They added that the phone also comes with the same fast-charging battery, wifi and features as its thicker phones.</p> <p>The iPhone Air will retail for $999, with preorders starting on Friday in advance of general availability on 19 September. Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup also includes standard, Pro and Pro Max editions. The company announced refreshes of the other versions of the smartphone on Tuesday as well, focusing on their cameras, processing speeds and battery life. The front-facing cameras in the new iPhones will ship with a dual filming mode that will capture the view from both the front and rear-facing lenses. The iPhone lineup will also come with additional storage capacity.</p> <p>Cook<strong> </strong>also introduced new versions of Apple’s signature white earphones and Apple Watch.<strong> </strong>The latest version of earphones, the AirPods Pro 3, comes with boosted noise cancellation and in five sizes of adjustable earpiece.</p> <p>The biggest feature coming to the new AirPods is live translation, allowing wearers to hear a translated version of a conversation with a person speaking another language. The earbuds go on sale on 19 September and will run for $249. The update brings Apple in line with its competitor Google, which added the translation feature to its Pixel Buds headphones years ago.</p> <p>Apple also revealed the Apple Watch series 11 with updated versions of the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch SE . The lineup of watches comes with new health features geared towards improving hypertension and sleep. The company said the former feature will notify wearers of possible hypertension, which Apple expects to do for at least 1 million people this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/27/apples-triple-threat-tariffs-ai-troubles-and-a-fortnite-fail\">Apple’s triple threat: tariffs, AI troubles and a Fortnite fail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Looming over the new product announcements are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a>, which threaten to disrupt the iPhone’s complex global supply chain with large price hikes, particularly the steep levy on China that is still under negotiation.

Not really. But the point is losses start to become wider at the end of the decade so the longer you maintain the hardline approach to population growth the worse it becomes over time.”</p> <p>In fact, with Australian women having 1.6 children on average – lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 – the population would eventually begin to shrink, threatening the economic stagnation that haunts countries like Japan and Italy.</p> <p>Then there’s the budgetary impact.</p> <p>Lower population growth would seriously damage our capacity to pay for the essential services Australians demand, especially as they get older.</p> <p>Instead of approaching a balanced budget by the mid-2030s (as is the current projection), the deficit widens to $87bn, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office’s build-your-own-budget tool.</p> <p>Total debt surpasses $2tn by June 2035; $437bn more than in a world where net migration continues as expected.</p> <p>And house prices?</p> <p>As mentioned, they are cumulatively 2.3% higher in a decade’s time than would have been under the base case of migration evolving as currently expected, the modelling shows.</p> <p>To be clear: that’s not that prices will be 2.3% higher than they are today; that’s the <em>additional</em> price growth after a decade.</p> <p>That’s because, Rynne says, the lower demand for housing is overwhelmed by the drop in the number of workers available to build homes.</p> <p>And higher wages also means higher inflation, which gobbles up the benefits of more pay.</p> <p>These are obviously stylised results, but they paint the picture of how slashing migration would flow through to growth, housing, the workforce and the budget.</p> <p>Migration is not the cure to all our economy’s ills, but in the long run a well managed program does more economic good than harm.</p> <p>• Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editor</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 September 2025 to clarify that the 2.3% increase in house prices was on top of the total price growth if current migration rates continue as expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>Police were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/08/heathrow-airport-terminal-evacuated-because-of-possible-hazardous-material\">called to Heathrow late on Monday</a> afternoon when 21 people fell ill in Terminal 4. Initial reports suggested a hazardous material could be involved and part of the airport was evacuated. But when the emergency services conducted a thorough search, no trace of any adverse substance was found.</p> <p>A source within the Metropolitan police subsequently suggested the event could be something quite different – <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5ypl5grg24t?post=asset%3Ade5d98cd-78ad-42af-882a-6e6371cb97d8#post\">a case of mass hysteria</a>. And some experts agree.</p> <p>“What happened at Heathrow is almost certainly an episode of mass psychogenic illness that is anxiety-based,” said Dr Robert Bartholomew, a University of Auckland sociologist who is an expert on the subject.</p> <p>While “mass hysteria” might bring to mind medieval reports of <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/dancing-plagues-and-mass-hysteria\">dancing plagues and epidemics of “possession”</a>, such events are not unknown in the modern world.</p> <p>The term, which has historical stigma and is often erroneously applied to situations from crowd crushes to moral panics, has gone out of use. Such events are now known as “mass psychogenic illness” or “mass sociogenic illness”, which take two main forms – those that are “motor-based” and others that are “anxiety-based”.</p> <p>Among examples of the former was a case in 2011 at LeRoy high school in New York, where affected students displayed vocal and motor tics such as twitches and spasms. While some feared an environmental toxin was at play, experts diagnosed the situation as a case of mass psychogenic illness, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us/schools-end-clears-up-new-york-students-mystery-twitching-idUSBRE85M0DG/\">aggravated by participation in social or traditional media.</a></p> <p>“These outbreaks occur in an atmosphere of anxiety that can span weeks or months. The long-term stress disrupts the nerves and neurons that send messages from the brain,” said Bartholomew, citing a notorious 1692 outbreak in Salem, Massachusetts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/carol-morley-the-falling-mass-hysteria-is-a-powerful-group-activity\">Carol Morley: ‘Mass hysteria is a powerful group activity’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said anxiety-based cases were typically triggered by the sudden perception of a toxic agent – such as an unfamiliar smell. “Common symptoms include headache, overbreathing, dizziness and fainting,” he said, noting episodes tended to come out of the blue with victims often recovering within minutes.</p> <p>It is this type of event that Bartholomew believes occurred at Heathrow. “I always say you have to investigate first before you render the diagnosis of mass psychogenic illness,” he said.</p> <p>“But they have gone there and they’ve tested, and they’ve tested negative. [And there was], rapid onset and recovery, benign, transient symptoms.” </p> <p>He added: “I suspect the person taken to hospital may have had a pre-existing condition and it was likely done as a precaution.”</p> <p>If the diagnosis of mass psychogenic illness is correct, it would not be the first time an airport has been linked to such an event: Bartholomew investigated a case at Melbourne airport in 2005 when 57 people fell ill<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-02-21/dozens-treated-after-suspected-airport-gas-leak/1522704\"> after reporting a “gassy smell</a>”. Bartholomew<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16336130/\"> </a>said a toxic agent could have caused some of the individuals to become unwell but all the signs strongly suggested mass psychogenic illness.</p> <p>Such events might not be uncommon. <a href=\"https://www.simonwessely.com/Downloads/Publications/Other_p/154.pdf\">In a 2010 study</a>, researchers randomly selected 280 of 747 reports of chemical incidents from the UK’s former health protection agency, finding 19 were probable episodes of mass psychogenic illness. Again, the researchers found odour was a robust predictor of such events, while schools and healthcare facilities were common settings.</p> <p>“A substantial minority of chemical incidents may be mass psychogenic illness,” they concluded.</p> <p>Prof Sir Simon Wessely of King’s College London, who was part of the team, said it was “a bit early” to come to judgments about the Heathrow event and it was unclear whether there was an unusual odour or what investigations were done to eliminate other causes. But he added: “If all these come to nothing, then yes, this may be an episode of what we now call mass sociogenic illness.”</p> <p>Bartholomew stressed the illness was not a mental disorder and victims were not psychologically disturbed.</p> <p>“It is best described as a collective stress reaction that is based on a belief. We all have beliefs, therefore we are all potential victims,” he said. “It is not ‘all in their heads’ in the sense that they are experiencing real symptoms.” </p> <p>Wessely added: “Study after study has never found anything different about those who are affected from those who aren’t. All of us can experience anxiety in certain symptoms, and all of us can mistake these physiological symptoms, which can be easily explained by basic physiology for evidence of something else – such as a chemical, toxin etc. And we know these can spread very quickly in crowded environments, usually by rumour and also line of sight.”</p> <p>Wessely said there was nothing unusual about the events at terminal 4 on Monday: “It happens all over the world every day, particularly in crowded spaces like schools, concerts, crowds, factory floors etc. The only reason this made the news was because of the fact it was at Heathrow and led to major flight disruptions.”</p> <p>• The headline of this article was amended on 9 September 2025 to better reflect the content of the story. A link was added in the subheading to later reporting of police finding a substance they said was “thought to have caused a reaction to those within the airport”.</p>",

Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn.</p> <p>“While we reported some positive momentum in the first quarter, market conditions softened somewhat in the second quarter, reflecting increased macro concerns and ongoing affordability challenges, particularly for first-time buyers, with expected interest rate cuts being pushed further out,” the builder said.</p> <p>Vistry said its forward order book was lower than a year ago, standing at £4.3bn against £5.1bn this time last year.</p> <p>It added that it was looking to boost flagging demand with sales and marketing initiatives. It is offering private buyers discounts of up to 5% on the sale price.</p> <p>“We are looking to drive an improvement in our open market sales rate in the second half through our sales and marketing initiatives albeit we remain mindful that demand will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties,” it said.</p> <p>Prices rose by 3% for private open market sales in the first half to £389,000 on average but it said sales rates were flat.</p> <p>The Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% in August but economists are expecting further reductions to come at a far slower pace amid stubbornly high inflation.</p> <p>However, Vistry was upbeat, saying it remained on track to meet full-year expectations.</p> <p>The company formed a long-term joint venture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/08/chinese-export-growth-slowest-six-months-shipments-us-fall-amid-tariff-tensions-oil-prices-climb-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68be9a6a8f0884821221bbd3#block-68be9a6a8f0884821221bbd3\">with the UK’s housing agency</a>, Homes England, earlier this week. The new vehicle, Hestia, is backed<strong> </strong>by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/23/labour-plans-to-build-15m-homes-will-that-help-britons-struggling-for-good-housing\">pledged</a> to build 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing.</p> <p>In June, the then housing secretary, Angela Rayner, announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/25/reeves-to-put-2bn-into-affordable-housing-to-sweeten-the-pill-of-cuts\">massive boost to the government’s affordable housing programme</a>, almost doubling funding to £39bn over the next decade.</p> <p>“The new social affordable homes programme provides an unprecedented level of funding for affordable housing over the next 10 years,” said Greg Fitzgerald, the Vistry chief executive. </p> <p>Vistry has shifted towards building social and affordable homes for its partners; it<a href=\"https://www.vistrygroup.co.uk/our-partnerships-model/our-partnerships-model#:~:text=A%20UNIQUE%20STRATEGIC%20ADVANTAGE,that%20is%20what%20we%20receive.%E2%80%9D\"> pre-sells at least 50% of new homes</a> on its developments to housing associations, local authorities and private rented sector providers.</p> <p>Anthony Codling, a housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: “[Private rented sector] investors continue to drive a hard bargain, leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding; so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way.</p> <p>“We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders.”</p>",

The trio are expected to bring a business perspective to the discussions, which is likely to inject a note of caution around more radical policies.</p> <p>Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was seen by some in government as one of the driving forces behind the botched welfare reforms at the spring statement, will also attend.</p> <p>The prime minister’s new chief secretary, Darren Jones – previously a Treasury minister – and the communications directors from both No 10 and No 11, will sit on the board, too, officials confirmed.</p> <p>Also on the board will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/03/a-class-act-tim-allan-the-former-blair-smoother-recalled-to-downing-street\">Starmer’s new communications chief, Tim Allan</a>, a veteran of Tony Blair’s time in government, with the former prime minister once describing him as “even more right wing than me”.</p> <p>Business groups have insisted Reeves should look elsewhere if she wants to raise more revenue, with the CBI’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/rachel-reeves-labour-tax-business-rates-vat\">arguing in the Guardian on Tuesday</a> that Labour should instead consider breaking its manifesto pledges not to increase taxes on “working people”.</p> <p>She also called for radical tax reform, including on VAT thresholds for firms, and the much-criticised stamp duty.</p> <p>In the aftermath of last year’s budget, which included £40bn of tax rises, Reeves told the CBI’s annual conference that she was “not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes”.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The boss of the Confederation of British Industry has suggested the chancellor should tear up Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, in a significant intervention before the budget.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves is widely expected to present a package of tax rises in her 26 November statement to offset deteriorating economic forecasts. However, the chancellor has been hamstrung by Labour’s promise not to increase the three main revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT.</p> <p>In a surprise move in the debate about how to raise extra revenue, the CBI’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, says the “time for tinkering is over”.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, the head of the longstanding lobby group representing many of the UK’s largest companies warns the chancellor against “slavish adherence” to tax promises made in the run-up to last year’s general election.</p> <p>She said the pre-election promises have now been overtaken by events.</p> <p>“The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,” she writes.</p> <p>“The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago.”</p> <p>The party’s manifesto <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">states</a>: “Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.”</p> <p>As well as suggesting Reeves revisit Labour’s promises on personal taxation, Newton-Smith calls for the reform of business rates, VAT thresholds for small firms and stamp duty.</p> <p>Reeves used her maiden budget last October to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-bets-on-public-spending-increases-in-budget-winning-over-voters\">a £40bn package of tax increases</a>, including a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions that was widely criticised by businesses and has been blamed for helping fuel inflation.</p> <p>The chancellor subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/03/rachel-reeves-i-was-wrong-to-say-no-big-tax-rises-would-be-needed\">promised not to return with further tax </a>rises, saying “there’s no need to come back with another budget like this” and “we’ll never need to do that again.”</p> <p>However, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts, after a review of its optimistic-looking expectations for productivity.</p> <p>This shift, coming after costly U-turns on welfare reform and the winter fuel allowance, could leave the Treasury looking for £20bn-£30bn in revenue in five years’ time to put Reeves on course to meet her fiscal rules.</p> <p>Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, agreed with Newton Smith that finding £20bn or more within the constraints of the manifesto would be problematic.</p> <p>“Raising that amount without touching taxes that account for three-quarters of the UK’s tax base risks distorting behaviour, loading excessive pain on to small groups, and harming economic growth,” she said. “Manifesto pledges are important, but there’s a point at which they cause more harm than they’re worth.”</p> <p>Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her determination to stick to the pledges in recent weeks, however, as speculation has mounted about potential tax rises.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are protecting payslips for working people by keeping our promise not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.” </p> <p>As well as calling for tax changes, Newton-Smith also reiterates the CBI’s concerns about the government’s employment rights legislation, which she argues is deterring firms from hiring.</p> <p>Angela Rayner was widely viewed as the champion of the employment rights package inside government and lobbying from business groups to water down aspects of the bill has intensified since Rayner’s resignation last week.</p> <p>“The employment rights bill in its current form will<em> </em>add cost and complexity, is already leading some firms to put hiring plans on ice, and risks making it even harder to bring people back into work,” Newton Smith says.</p> <p>The bill includes immediate protection from unfair dismissal, after a yet-to-be determined probationary period, the right to regular hours, and the right for unions to access workplaces.</p> <p>Union leaders gathering in Brighton for the TUC conference on Tuesday said Labour had sought to issue reassurances that the party was still committed to the landmark bill.</p> <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who is standing in the contest to succeed Rayner as deputy Labour leader, told delegates on Tuesday: “One year ago we were elected to deliver this employment rights bill, and congress that is what we will do. We will not accept any watering down by the Lords. Forward with the employment rights bill in full. No ifs, no buts.”</p> <p>One union leader said ministers risked blowing up relations with the labour movement at a difficult moment for the government, and would need to retain its workers’ rights plan to show a key point of difference with Nigel Farage’s Reform. “They are not going to want to go to party conference fighting with us,” the leader argued.</p> <p>Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said the government reshuffle had created “anxiety” at the Brighton conference, but that he believed Labour would push ahead with a policy that sought to bridge business and union demands.</p> <p>“We need to take business with us on this journey, the re-regulation of the labour market is necessary and not up for debate, but, you know, we know what it’s like to have been on the wrong end of getting things done to us for 14 years.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle in the wake of Rayner’s departure, partly aimed at bolstering the government’s growth agenda.</p> <p>At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the prime minister told colleagues they should be ready to “move from fixing the foundations to driving forward the growth and national renewal that delivers for working people”, according to a readout from his official spokesperson.</p>",

    "title": "How to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg review – spinning Silicon Valley",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/10/how-to-save-the-internet-by-nick-clegg-review-spinning-silicon-valley",
    "description": "<p>Instead of recognising that social media harms mental health and democracy, the former deputy PM and Meta executive repeats company talking points</p>",
    "content": "<p>Nick Clegg chooses difficult jobs. He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as&nbsp;well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.</p> <p>The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one caused <em>by</em> the internet; it is the threat <em>to</em> the internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself or Meta or big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I&nbsp;believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”</p> <p>But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a&nbsp;defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”</p> <p>As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/social-media-smartphones-harm-regret.html\">asked questions rather like these</a> to a&nbsp;nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/opinion/parents-smartphones-tiktok-facebook.html\">survey of parents</a>, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still. <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2023-131/\">Other researchers</a> <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/flrnzo5x/public-attitudes-to-smartphones-social-media-and-online-safety-1.pdf\">have made similar findings</a>.</p> <p>In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.</p> <p>Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the many <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344657/\">studies</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.afterbabel.com/p/phone-based-childhood-cause-epidemic\">other side</a>. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word from <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/what-the-research-on-social-medias-impact-on-democracy-and-daily-life-says-and-doesnt-say/\">a rebuttal essay</a> that Meta put out in 2022 in response to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/\">one of my essays</a> laying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Clegg’s claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational is contradicted by dozens of Meta employees, contractors, whistleblowers, and leaked documents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. From <a href=\"https://nmag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-12-05-NM-v.-Meta-et-al.-COMPLAINT-REDACTED.pdf\">the brief</a> filed by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns. Clegg added his own plea at the top, saying that it was “increasingly urgent” to address “concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health”. Clegg noted that the company’s “well-being work is both understaffed and fragmented”. Zuckerberg did not respond to the email.</p> <p>Clegg’s current claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational, and that the correlations are too small to be taken seriously, is contradicted by dozens of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/instagram-facebook-teens-harassment-safety-5d991be1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhLPDbur4ZFYz8cmU2vAw5IYMWJcer0GzaSrNr6953kbMYmANwL_DZVnEYdVHE%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68a876be&amp;amp;gaa_sig=t3oiF4NImhbvazvhDAez5nyDMK8SVM_H3hwEhdZ_qnDCZ8GLDQlcStMk3hK42hn37YAguvcYKkA5QvmGsRQjHg%3D%3D\">Meta employees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/tracker/new-mexico-v-meta-inc-and-mark-zuckerberg/\">contractors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7,article_inline\">whistleblowers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/Doc%2073-2%20Complaint%20%28limited%20redactions%29%20-11.22.2023.pdf\">leaked</a> <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2024/1/10/pr23-03.html\">documents</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/\">that show</a> otherwise. To take just one example, in a <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2024/1/10/pr23-03.html\">brief</a> from the attorney general of Tennessee we learn about a 2019 study Meta commissioned on teenage mental health. The researchers alerted Meta that “[teens] are hooked despite how it makes them feel … Instagram is addictive, and time-spend on the platform is having a negative impact on mental health”. A bit later: “Instagram is the worst platform for mental health.”</p> <p>Turning to his proposals for how to save the internet, Clegg lays out two pillars: “radical transparency” and collaboration. On transparency, he urges tech companies to be more forthcoming about how their algorithms work and how they make their decisions. He warns: “If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to open up, the choice will be taken out of their hands.”</p> <p>On collaboration, he calls for a “digital democracies alliance”, because he is concerned, rightly, that China has developed its technologies in ways that shore up its authoritarian system. He wants the democracies of the world to act together so that the internet might live up to the democracy-promoting visions so many of us shared in the 1990s.</p> <p>Would Clegg’s plan work? Transparency is great in theory, but I fear that it may be too late to apply these principles to the powerful companies that now control much of the internet. As tech journalist Kara Swisher memorably<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/success/boss-files-kara-swisher-tech-accountability\"> said in 2019</a>, Zuckerberg and the other founders “built a city without street signs, without sewage, without police, without garbage men. Imagine that city. It’s not a good city to live in, but they collect all the rent on everything.” This is why scammers, sextortionists, drug dealers and political extremists thrive on these platforms and pose dangers to teens and to democracies that the big companies seem unable to fix. More transparency in 2026 may not be enough to repair the terrible urban design laid down 20 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/14/big-tech-picking-apart-europe-democracy-switch-off-algorithms\">Big tech is picking apart European democracy, but there is a solution: switch off its algorithms | Johnny Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for collaboration, it’s hard to imagine companies like Meta giving up their data or their sovereignty, especially now that the tech moguls have so much support from the Trump administration, and now that the Trump administration is so willing to apply pressure on other countries. If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to collaborate, it’s just not clear to me that “the choice will be taken out of their hands”. By whom?</p> <p>The great biologist and ant expert EO Wilson once said about Marxism: “Good ideology. Wrong species.” After reading this, plus several of the many books about Meta’s unethical, careless, “break things” culture, as well as hundreds of pages from the 2021 document leak known as The Facebook Files and from ongoing lawsuits, I&nbsp;suggest we might say something similar about Clegg’s proposals: “Good plan. Wrong industry.”</p> <p><em>• </em>Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and author of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Anxious Generation (Penguin)<em>. </em>How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict by Nick Clegg is published Bodley Head (£25).

We need to ensure that people crossing the Channel know that it is dangerous, that their lives will not be easy in the UK and that they could be returned under the new agreement.”</p> <p>More than 50,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats since Labour came to power in July 2024, with the vast majority embarking on dangerous crossings from beaches across northern France.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a woman died when the overcrowded dinghy she was in suffered what Kent police described as a “catastrophic deflation” 10 miles off the coast of Dover. The woman was airlifted to shore but pronounced dead, police said.</p> <p>The publicity campaign was drawn up by officials in the Home Office under the last home secretary, Yvette Cooper. It has been endorsed by Shabana Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/07/as-home-secretary-shabana-mahmood-will-face-enormous-challenges\">who was promoted to the role on Friday</a>.

A sign is not going to deter a single person from crossing the Channel in order to be allowed to claim asylum in the UK.</p> <p>“It’s time the government ditched the gimmicks and the so-called deterrents that never work. The only way to end Channel crossings is to create proper, safe routes for people to claim asylum. Presumably the government has already paid for the signage for the beaches, so we could even convert the signs to provide information on how people can apply for those safe routes.”</p> <p>The Home Office is expected to launch the campaign shortly. The department has been asked how much it plans to spend on the campaign, but did not respond before publication.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When in distress, babies produce chaotic wails which have pronounced effects on humans, including changes in facial temperature</p>",
    "content": "<p>The cry of a distressed baby triggers a rapid emotional response in both men and women that is enough to make them physically hotter, researchers say.</p> <p>Thermal imaging revealed that people experienced a rush of blood to the face that raised the temperature of their skin when they were played recordings of babies wailing.</p> <p>The effect was stronger and more synchronised when babies were more distressed, leading them to produce more chaotic and disharmonious cries. The work suggests that humans respond automatically to specific features in cries that ramp up when babies are in pain.</p> <p>“The emotional response to cries depends on their ‘acoustic roughness’,” said Prof Nicolas Mathevon at the University of Saint-Etienne in France. “We are emotionally sensitive to the acoustic parameters that encode the level of pain in a baby’s cry.”</p> <p>Evolution equipped baby humans with a hard-to-ignore wail to boost their odds of getting the care they need. But not all infant cries are the same. When a baby is in real distress, they forcefully contract their rib cage, producing higher pressure air that causes chaotic vibrations in the vocal cords. This produces “acoustic roughness”, or more technically, disharmonious sounds called nonlinear phenomena (NLP).</p> <p>To see how men and women responded to infants’ cries, scientists played recordings to volunteers with little or no experience with babies. While listening, the participants were filmed with a thermal camera that captured subtle changes in their facial temperature.</p> <p>The adults listened to 16 different cries over four sessions and rated whether the baby was in discomfort or significant pain. The cries were recorded from babies in different levels of distress, ranging from discomfort in the bath to feeling the scratch of a needle at a vaccine clinic.</p> <p>Footage from the thermal camera showed that men and women responded to babies’ cries in much the same way. The wails with the most NLP, regardless of pitch, were rated as coming from babies in real pain and triggered the greatest changes in the adults’ facial temperature.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150\">Journal of The Royal Society Interface</a>, the scientists describe how NLP in babies’ cries produces an automatic response in men and women, suggesting people pick up on the acoustic features to distinguish between babies that are merely unhappy and those in real pain.</p> <p>“The more pain the cries express, the stronger the response of our autonomic nervous system, indicating that we emotionally sense the pain information encoded in the cries,” said Mathevon. “No one had ever measured our response to cries like this before and it is too early to know if there will be practical applications one day.”</p> <p>The study follows <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819066/\">work last month</a> from researchers in Denmark that challenges the claim that women are hardwired to wake up more easily than men when a baby starts crying. It found that men were as likely as women to be woken by wailing infants, despite mothers being three times more likely to get up and tend to the child.</p> <p>The reasons for the disparity are up for debate, but Prof Christine Parsons, who led the team, suggested two potential factors. First, mothers often took maternity leave before fathers took paternity leave and learned how to calm their baby earlier. Second, when mothers were breastfeeding, it might be sensible for fathers to sleep through.</p> <p>“Much of the previous work on adults’ physiological responses to infant crying has looked at heart rate, skin conductance, or even brain responses. So this study is innovating,” Parsons said. “People often assume there will be a clear distinction between men and women in how they respond to crying. The authors set out to test this, and found no evidence for a difference,” she added. “We were also surprised at how little difference there was between men and women.”</p>",

There are growing calls for the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, including the PDCA scheme for former prime ministers, to launch an inquiry.</p> <p>Johnson did not directly respond to questions about the slew of revelations concerning his apparent attempts to monetise his time in Downing Street after stepping down as prime minister in September 2022.</p> <p>They include business ventures in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-nicolas-maduro-meeting-invoice\">Venezuela</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-secretly-lobbied-uae-business-venture-leak-suggests\">UAE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-sought-business-with-saudi-officials-better-earth\">Saudi Arabia</a> involving individuals he met while prime minister.</p> <p>In his first comments since the Guardian revealed details of the leak, Johnson denied suggestions he was misusing public funds. “This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Guardian revealed further details about the operations of Johnson’s private office. They suggest the former Conservative leader:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/boris-johnson-secretly-lobbied-uae-business-venture-leak-suggests\">Secretly lobbied the UAE for a billion-dollar private venture in a potential breach of ethics rules</a>.

Two years earlier, in May 2022, Johnson’s government had authorised the £2.5bn sale of Chelsea Football Club to, among others, Clearlake. (A source at the company said the two events were entirely unconnected.)</p> <p>There are also questions over whether, in return for cash, he is divulging views or information former prime ministers typically keep to themselves.</p> <p>Johnson’s audiences have been treated to his views on Barack Obama (“the most inert, invertebrate president we’ve had for a long, long time”) and Vladimir Putin (“like the fat boy in Dickens, he wants to make your flesh creep”), as well as private anecdotes about the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen\">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, including a time he said she advised him to talk to birds.</p> <p>The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which monitors the activities of former ministers and senior civil servants, said it would look into Johnson’s newly revealed contacts and income since leaving office.</p> <p>A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.</p> <p>However, the Liberal Democrats have called on the NAO to launch a formal investigation into potential misuse of public funds. The NAO has the power to examine the paperwork that is submitted by former prime ministers to claim their allowance.</p> <p>Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of public standards, said Johnson had questions to answer over the revelations. Speaking to the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast, Thomas-Symonds said: “Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer about his conduct in Covid. And on previous evidence, his behaviour since leaving office has been a disgrace.”</p> <p>The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, defended Johnson’s right to undertake lucrative work after he had left office. “I think that people should be able to earn money when they leave politics,” she told GB News.</p>",

    "content": "<p>These days, revellers converge on the West Country from all parts of the UK and beyond to take part in the wonderful craziness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury\">the Glastonbury festival.</a></p> <p>It turns out that at the end of the bronze age – also a time of climatic and economic crisis – the same sort of impulse gripped people.</p> <p>Experts have been examining animal bones excavated at middens (large prehistoric rubbish tips) in Wiltshire and the Thames Valley and found evidence suggesting that more than 2,000 years ago, people travelled from far and wide to congregate for great meat feasts.</p> <p>They have discovered evidence that bronze age people were habitually driving large numbers of pigs and cattle hundreds of miles to the same sites for decades.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/madgwickrd3\">Richard Madgwick</a>, who is based at <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/history-archaeology-religion\">Cardiff University’s school of history, archaeology and religion</a>, said the findings pointed to an “age of feasting”.</p> <p>“At a time of climatic and economic instability, people in southern Britain turned to feasting,” he said.</p> <p>Madgwick said the events were probably ways of building and consolidating relationships within and between communities. “I’m pretty sure these gatherings would have had a really important role to play in creating some degree of community cohesion at a time of trouble.”</p> <p>Just as modern festivals have different vibes and appeal to varied audiences, the discoveries at the middens suggest the feasting spots had individual characteristics.</p> <p>The largest that was examined, at Potterne, near Devizes in Wiltshire, is packed with feasting remains, including up to 15m bone fragments.</p>    <p>There, pork was the meat of choice, with pigs brought in from a wide catchment area including Wales, Cornwall and Devon and central northern or north-west England.</p> <p>Further east, Runnymede in Surrey was another significant gathering point but the people there appear to have been favouring beef, with cattle arriving in large numbers from Wales and Cornwall/Devon.</p> <p>At East Chisenbury, about 10 miles from Stonehenge, the number of sheep remains suggest mutton may have been the meat of choice and the research shows the majority of the animals came from the immediate surroundings.</p>    <p>It was a difficult time when the climate was getting wetter and the status of bronze appears to have been being downgraded.</p> <p>Madgwick said the Potterne and Runnymede people may have been reacting to this by organising large gatherings, welcoming in outsiders, while those living in East Chisenbury seemed more determined to keep things local and make the most of what they had there. “Each little community is reacting to this time of instability differently,” he said.</p> <p>For the study, the scientists used multi-isotope analysis, a rapidly developing method in archaeology. Each geographical area has a different chemical make-up and this permeates into the water and food grown there. As animals eat and drink, these regional markers remain locked in their bones, allowing researchers to trace where they were reared centuries later.</p>    <p>Madgwick said the middens were huge and the volume of material there staggering. “We’re talking about millions and millions of bone fragments, potentially hundreds of thousands of animals.”</p> <ul> <li><p>The paper describing the work is called Diverse feasting networks at the end of the Bronze Age in Britain (c. 900-500 BCE) evidenced by multi-isotope analysis and is published in <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/iscience/home\">the journal iScience.</a></p></li> </ul>",

Imagine having a Facebook account, and also having the name Mark Zuckerberg. You’d spend your whole life being flooded with messages and requests and abuse.</p> <p><strong>That makes sense.</strong> Also, Indianapolis Zuckerberg spent thousands of dollars on Facebook to advertise his legal firm, but Meta kept deactivating his account after assuming he was impersonating a celebrity. So now he’s suing Meta.</p> <p><strong>I always feel sorry for people who share names with celebrities.</strong> Me too. Remember the poor mild-mannered Virginian man John Lewis who, thanks to the fact that he owns the @johnlewis handle on X, spends weeks of his life calmly but firmly explaining to strangers that he is a person and not a large chain of UK department stores?</p> <p><strong>What a nightmare. </strong>Then there’s the late children’s author Jeremy Strong, who had the stranglehold on his name for years until the TV series Succession came along. He spent his latter years apologising to strangers for not being the actor who played Kendall Roy.</p> <p><strong>Well that’s just bad luck on his part.</strong> Bad luck for lawyer Zuckerberg, too. Prior to the lawsuit he had been keeping track of everything that has happened to him since the younger Mark Zuckerberg came to prominence.</p> <p><strong>Oh really, like what? </strong>He has been mistakenly sued by the state of Washington while companies refuse to take his business for fear that he’s pranking them. He’s spoken about seeing disappointment on the faces of limo drivers sent to pick him up. And when he signed up for 23andme, he was inundated with people who a) claimed to be related to him and b) asked for money.</p> <p><strong>What a nightmare. </strong>Anyway, Meta has decided to reinstate Mark Zuckerberg’s account, and has apologised for the confusion, but the lawsuit stands to go ahead nonetheless.</p> <p> <strong>Well good luck to him. </strong>And there’s precedent here too. In 2019, the designer Katie Perry sued the singer Katy Perry for trademark infringement. Unfortunately for Indianapolis Zuckerberg, the singer won on appeal and Katie Perry was forced to deregister her trademark.</p> <p><strong>Bad time to be called Katie Perry. </strong>Or Mark Zuckerberg. </p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It’s hard being named after someone famous.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “As my newborn son Donald Trump will soon discover.”</p>",

Labour should rethink its North Sea stance, 2 September</a>) cites Offshore Energies’ estimate that offshore jobs are being lost at a rate of about 1,000 a month. What this and a similar estimate by the shadow energy minister, Andrew Bowie, of 400 job losses every fortnight up to 2030, misses is that this is less than half the rate of job losses under the Tories between 2013 and 2023. During this time, they continued to invest in new oil and gas fields<em> </em>and 227,000 workers lost their jobs all the same. That’s a rate of 436 a week.</p> <p>Analysis of North Sea data by the <a href=\"https://www.endfuelpoverty.org.uk/north-sea-gas-unable-to-meet-national-heating-needs-from-2027/\">End Fuel Poverty Coalition</a> shows that by 2027, more than two-thirds of the UK’s gas needs will be completely dependent on imports, and even if new fields are approved, the UK will still be 94% reliant on imports by 2050. Given the horrendous carbon footprint of US liquefied natural gas, that makes it even more imperative that we make any continued gas use as residual as possible.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/media/vtjkyqnf/uk-reserves-and-resources-report-as-at-end-2023.pdf\">official statistics</a>, only 14% of the gas originally estimated to be in the North Sea basin remains commercially viable. Even if this only supplied national needs, at current levels of demand existing fields would hold just three years of gas, while new fields would add less than six months. So there is no jobs lifeline in opposing the ban on new investment.</p> <p>Unions should be campaigning for a plan like Uplift’s <a href=\"https://www.upliftuk.org/post/a-new-deal-for-the-north-sea\">New Deal for the North Sea</a>, which sets out a lifeline from oil and gas to work on offshore renewables.

More jobs in Scotland, the north and in south Wales would make for a more “one&nbsp;nation” United Kingdom, complete with less housing pressure in the overpopulated south.</p> <p>There are much more effective ways to help the environment, such as expanding public transport, planting more trees and tightening up on plastic waste.

    "description": "<p>New rules come into force from 30 September in order to restore habitats and reduce flooding</p>",
    "content": "<p>Burning on England’s deep peat will be banned in order to restore habitats for rare wildlife and reduce air pollution and flooding, the government has said.</p> <p>England’s peatlands are in poor shape due to having been burned, intensively drained and used as grouse moors. They naturally act like a sponge, with layers of moss and other vegetation, and store vast amounts of carbon: an estimated 3.2bn tonnes in the UK alone.</p> <p>When they are in a dried-out state, they do not hold water, which can contribute to flooding of communities downstream. They also release carbon into the atmosphere, rather than storing it.</p> <p>According to government data, 80% of peatlands across England are dried out and deteriorating. Vegetation on peatland is often burned to create habitat for grouse, which like to feed on the fresh shoots of new plants that grow after the burn. This increases the number of birds available to be shot for sport. Burning the peat can also kill wildlife, such as adders, toads, and ground-nesting birds.</p> <p>The previous Conservative government announced rules to ban the burning of some peatland areas. But experts argued the rules were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/30/peatlands-in-england-at-risk-amid-apparent-flouting-of-regulations\">not fit for purpose</a> and left precious habitats and carbon sinks vulnerable to destruction.</p> <p>The legislation banned the burning of vegetation on areas of deep peat (more than 40cm depth) on a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) that is also a special area of conservation or a special protection area, unless a licence has been granted or the land is steep or rocky. This left many areas of deep peat unprotected. Countryside groups <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/20/grouse-shooting-row-ministers-back-rspb-peatland-burning-ban/\">complained</a> at the time that the government was “attacking grouse shooting” and the Countryside Alliance <a href=\"https://www.countryside-alliance.org/resources/politics/regulation-of-heather-burning-on-peatlands\">lobbied against </a>a ban.</p> <p>Under the new rules, which come into force from 30 September, the burning ban will be extended to all peat over 30cm deep, not just on SSSIs, and will cover 676,628 hectares of deep peat – up from the current 222,000 hectares.</p> <p>Environment minister Mary Creagh said: “Our peatlands are England’s Amazon rainforest – home to our most precious wildlife, storing carbon and reducing flooding downstream. Burning on peatland releases harmful smoke ruining local air quality and damaging the precious ecosystems found in these iconic landscapes. Restricting burning will help us restore and rewet peatlands. These new measures will create resilient peatlands that are naturally protected from wildfires.”</p> <p>Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, said: “Extending the ban on burning over peat in the English uplands is a hugely positive step forwards towards protecting these precious habitats and reducing carbon emissions. Burning them is bad for nature, for the climate, for water quality and for managing flood risk.”</p>",

Cross-party senior politicians have been calling for Johnson’s taxpayer support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/call-to-halt-boris-johnson-allowance-after-boris-files-revelations\">to be suspended</a> in the wake of the revelations. </p> \n<p>Johnson’s private office receives funding from the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which is afforded to all prime ministers to assist with their public duties after leaving Downing Street. PDCA funds are not supposed to be used for private or commercial activities.</p> \n<p>Former prime ministers can claim up to £115,000 a year for the remainder of their lifetime. A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.</p> \n<p>A cache of leaked files seen by the Guardian suggests all three of Johnson’s private office staff have supported his commercial activities. Johnson has been using his office to broker deals worth millions with foreign governments, the files indicate.</p> \n<p>The files were obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS), a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked data.</p> \n<p>Other prime ministers are now likely to be asked to declare how they are using the public funds.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Brown said: “The PDCA allowance is paid to the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown and not directly to Mr Brown. The PDCA is only used to reclaim partial salary costs for some members of staff who support Mr Brown’s public duties.</p> \n<p>“This varies for each member of staff to reflect the public duty element of the work they do. In line with staff’s right to privacy and confidentiality, we only provide detail to the Cabinet Office.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Mr Brown favours former prime ministers being subject to public declarations of their business interests and has called for a stronger code on business appointments.”</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Blair said he “fully conforms to the rules relating to the public duty costs allowance, which allows for a reimbursement towards the costs associated with his former role and for which all documentation is provided to the Cabinet Office and subsequently reviewed by the NAO [National Audit Office]”.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Truss said: “Liz’s claims for PDCA cover office and staffing costs relating to her ongoing public duties and do not support any private or commercial activities.”</p> \n<p>Tim Durrant, a programme director at the Institute for Government, said: “Former prime ministers have to account to the Cabinet Office for the spending of their offices in order to claim the allowance. The allowance is only for costs relating to their public role as a former prime minister and it’s important that the Cabinet Office ensures that public funds are only being used for this purpose.”</p> \n<p>The Cabinet Office guidance states it does not retain any of the documentation provided to it by former prime ministers.</p> \n<p>The scheme was created by Robin Butler, Margaret Thatcher’s loyal cabinet secretary. According to a report in the Times from 1991, it was introduced after friends of Thatcher, by then a backbench MP on a reduced salary, “let the considerable difficulties she faced on leaving office be known at Westminster”.</p> \n<p>The money was always intended to pay for the public functions expected of former prime ministers, not to subsidise profit-generating business. Former leaders are entitled to use the scheme for the rest of their lives. The amount they can claim has been frozen since 2011.</p> \n<p>Cabinet Office data reveals that John Major, Blair and Brown have claimed more than £1m each since 2015-16. Cameron has claimed close to the threshold but reduced his claims when he became foreign secretary under Rishi Sunak. Theresa May and Truss did not claim the maximum entitlement. Data is yet to be published on claims, if any, by Sunak.</p> \n<p>Cameron, Sunak, Major and May did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did Nick Clegg, who was exceptionally entitled to the scheme as a former deputy prime minister. </p> \n<p>Johnson said: “This story is rubbish. The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>Boris Johnson contacted Elon Musk on behalf of the Evening Standard owner, Evgeny Lebedev, as part of an attempt to get the US tech billionaire to support the ailing newspaper, leaked files suggest.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s private office, which is taxpayer-subsidised, emailed an executive close to Musk in June 2024, forwarding a business proposal from Lord Lebedev.</p> \n<p>“Dear Elon, I admire what you’ve done for liberty. Can the next step in the fight be putting together your AI power behind a 200-year-old trusted news voice called the London Evening Standard?” Lebedev wrote.</p> \n<p>“My thoughts are in an age of deepfakes and general confusion about information this would be a powerful pairing. If you’re up for a chat I am up for coming to see you.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-secret-meeting-palantir-peter-thiel\">Johnson and Cummings’ secret meeting with Palantir founder revealed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The email to the owner of X is contained in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">leak from Johnson’s office</a> seen by the Guardian. The leak was obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.</p> \n<p>The email is likely to renew questions over foreign influence in UK politics. Musk has made no secret of his desire to sway political views through his social media platform, which he has owned since 2022. He is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/majority-of-britons-believe-musk-having-negative-impact-on-uk-politics\">fierce critic of Keir Starmer</a>, especially over immigration and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/06/why-is-elon-musk-attacking-keir-starmer-over-grooming-scandal\">grooming gangs scandal</a>.</p> \n<p>While Lebedev does not expressly raise the question of investment in the Evening Standard, the request for some kind of partnership will also raise questions over foreign ownership of the UK press.</p> \n<p>Parliament recently passed legislation placing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/14/foreign-states-limited-to-15-stake-in-uk-newspapers-amid-telegraph-uncertainty\">limits on foreign ownership</a> of media organisations meaning foreign states can only own stakes of up to 15% – but the rules do not apply to foreign individuals.</p> \n<p>It is unclear whether Musk responded to the business offer, which was sent a month after Lebedev announced his decision to close the daily print edition of the historic London title and rebrand it as a weekly news sheet, the Standard.</p> \n<p>At the time of the email, Musk was pouring much of his financial and media firepower into backing the election of Donald Trump. He has since taken a wider interest in European politics and endorsed far-right political parties across Europe, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-congratulates-afd-alice-weidel-germany-election\">Germany’s AfD</a> and, briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/03/nigel-farage-very-pleased-elon-musk-backs-reform-uk-calling-him-a-hero\">Reform UK</a>, though later he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/05/farage-refuses-to-condemn-free-speech-hero-musks-remarks-on-jess-phillips\">expressed doubt</a> in the abilities of its leader, Nigel Farage.</p> \n<p>The email seen by the Guardian shows the former prime minister’s staff playing the role of a fixer for Lebedev, a longtime friend of Johnson, who controversially made him a peer in 2020. Lebedev had staunchly backed Johnson via the Evening Standard throughout Johnson’s time as London mayor.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Lebedev said: “Why do you think it is remarkable for me to reach out to one of the most successful businessmen of the age? This is how business works. We talk to each other and make proposals and plans. Pretty much every business in the world is thinking about how it can harness AI.”</p> \n<p>Musk and Johnson are thought to have met on at least one occasion since Johnson left office. An itinerary seen by the Guardian includes a 30-minute video call during the UP Summit in Texas in October 2023, eight months before Johnson’s office forwarded Lebedev’s request to Musk.</p> \n<p>Forwarding the email, the staffer in Johnson’s office acknowledges the request is “slightly random” before explaining that “a friend of Boris’s asked if we could relay the message below to Elon. His name is Lord Evgeny Lebedev – who owns the London Evening Standard newspaper (along with a couple of other outlets and numerous other business interests).”</p> \n<p>The staffer says Johnson “has no personal interest in this – other than a longstanding belief in supporting a strong free press”.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s friendship with Lebedev, who also has a minority stake in the Independent website and is the son of a billionaire former colonel in the KGB, Alexander Lebedev, has often been the subject of controversy.</p> \n<p>The former prime minister has regularly attended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/21/parties-politics-peerages-boris-johnson-evgeny-lebedev-friendship\">parties hosted by Lebedev</a>, including a much-discussed gathering in April 2018 when Johnson, who was then foreign secretary, attended Lebedev’s Tuscan palazzo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\">without his security detail.</a> </p> \n<h2>Daily Mail and GB News</h2> \n<p>The leaked files also shed light on Johnson’s relationship with other UK media, which has been the source of at least two lucrative contracts since he resigned as prime minister. Documents suggest he was offered £500,000 for his columns in the Daily Mail, with additional payments for bonus podcasts or other appearances.</p> \n<p>A letter from the group managing editor of Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail, to Johnson offers the payment for 46 Saturday columns over the course of the year. It is not clear whether the text of the letter reflects the version of the contract ultimately signed by Johnson and the paper.</p> \n<p>The announcement of Johnson’s recruitment as a Mail columnist, one day after a parliamentary committee concluded he had lied to parliament over lockdown parties in Downing Street, prompted an investigation by the government’s Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).</p> \n<p>It found that his failure to consult the body until half an hour before taking the role constituted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/27/reform-calls-after-johnson-found-to-have-broken-rules-over-daily-mail-job\">unambiguous breach</a> of its rules, prompting its chair to implore the government to grant it further powers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A copy of Johnson’s contract with GB News, the rightwing broadcaster that hired the former prime minister as a presenter in October 2023, also appears in the files – revealing that it hoped the former prime minister would front its 2024 election coverage.</p> \n<p>It stipulated that Johnson would only be paid if he presented multiple editions of his own TV show and appeared alongside the channel’s other presenters. Johnson has not fulfilled any of these obligation.</p> \n<p>The media regulator Ofcom is currently under pressure to ban politicians including Farage from acting as presenters on the channel. It has previously concluded that the British public was “instinctively uncomfortable” with politicians hosting current affairs programmes but there was “no clear consensus for an outright ban”.</p> \n<p>Ofcom has found GB News breached impartiality rules by paying Conservative MPs hundreds of thousands of pounds to serve as news presenters but it stopped short of imposing sanctions on the channel.</p> \n<p>According to the contract seen by the Guardian, Johnson’s reporting duties for the channel were supposed to have included fronting a primetime programme six times a year, an “on-location” live audience special, regular live contributions to other presenters’ GB News shows, occasional feature appearances, and helming 2024 general election coverage.</p> \n<p>In exchange, Johnson would receive £350,000 plus expenses, with bonus payments of £75,000 and £37,500 for optional additional presenting work around the UK and US elections. Despite the contract, Johnson’s only substantive appearance seems to have been a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdPwCFpTVa0\">one-hour sitdown interview</a> with another GB News presenter, Camilla Tominey.</p> \n<p>GB News said: “As usual, the Guardian is incorrect. GB News has an ongoing arrangement with Mr Johnson as a contributor, and we are delighted to do so. Beyond this, which is already a matter of public record, we do not comment on or share private and confidential arrangements with any of our staff.”</p> \n<p>Johnson did not respond directly to questions about Musk, Lebedev, GB News or Associated Newspapers. In a statement to the Guardian, he denied the suggestion his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">private office misused</a> the subsidy scheme intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” Johnson said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules.

    "content": "<p>The City regulator has warned it will challenge lenders claiming to have lost customer records about mis-sold car loans to ensure they get their fair share of a potential £18bn compensation pot.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/03/city-regulator-unveils-car-loan-compensation-scheme-worth-up-to-18bn\">to open its redress scheme</a> to contracts dating back to 2007, but some lenders have complained that they do not have records stretching back that far.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, , the FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, said this would not be accepted as a blanket excuse. “Where a firm says to us that they don’t have the data, we’re not just going to take that at face value. We will look at that very forensically,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/17/now-fraudsters-are-trying-to-mis-sell-you-a-car-loan-payout\">Now fraudsters are trying to mis-sell you a car loan payout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scheme is meant to draw a line under the car finance scandal, compensating millions of drivers who were overcharged as a result of controversial commission arrangements between lenders and car dealers. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/01/supreme-court-hands-partial-win-to-car-finance-companies-over-compensation-claims\">follows a supreme court ruling</a> in August, which upheld one of three consumer complaints over commission.</p> <p>But some lenders argue they may not be able to verify claims that are nearly 20 years old, as consumer data and contracts were likely to have been lost or deleted. While the FCA ordered firms to stop deleting car finance documents in 2024, that will only secure a small portion of the data, given that most banks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/26/about-1bn-in-car-loan-compensation-at-risk-because-data-deleted-lawyers-warn\">typically purge customer data after six years.</a></p> <p>Sheree Howard, the FCA executive director in charge of authorisations, told MPs that lenders could end up retrieving data by working with other companies. “There is an ability, we think, across quite a high proportion [of firms] to get reasonable data, and … firms can work with third parties to try supplement that data like credit reference agencies,” she said.</p> <p>The FCA announced plans for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/03/city-regulator-unveils-car-loan-compensation-scheme-worth-up-to-18bn\">redress scheme</a> last month, which will go out for consultation by early October. The regulator estimates that the scheme could end up costing car lenders – which range from high street lenders such as Lloyds Banking Group and Santander UK to specialist lenders such as Close Brothers – between £9bn and £18bn, with borrowers likely to get up to £950 on average for each claim.</p> <p>It followed a high-stake supreme court ruling, in which judges upheld one consumer’s claim, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/04/its-a-bit-strange-the-uk-factory-worker-who-beat-the-car-lenders-in-court\">deemed to have been “unfair”</a> due in part to the size of the commission paid to the car dealer and how it was disclosed.</p> <p>While FCA bosses said they hoped the bulk of consumer compensation would be paid out next year, Rathi warned that firms that disagree with the payout plan could end up holding up the entire process. “There may be parties that seek to delay this,” he said. <br><br>The Treasury committee chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier asked Rathi for the names of companies he was referring to, saying it was important to know whether groups with “deep pockets” were trying to influence the regulator and potentially impact compensation for their constituents. But Rathi refused, suggesting it was something to be discussed in a private session.</p> <p>The Financing and Leasing Association, which represents car lenders, said last month that it could challenge the FCA’s compensation scheme in court if it ends up handing “disproportionate” payouts to drivers.</p> <p>Rathi also pushed back against suggestions that the FCA’s handling of the motor finance scandal had had a “chilling effect” on investment and the wider financial sector. “If a firm, or their dealers or agents, have not been honest with their customers, that’s not a chilling effect that’s been created by the regulatory system or legal system … let’s be clear about that,” he said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Anglo American, of the FTSE 100 index, and the Canadian group Teck Resources, would like you to think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/anglo-american-merge-teck-copper-london-listing\">their proposed $53bn (£39bn) combo</a> as “a true merger of equals”, which it obviously isn’t because the UK-listed company is about twice the size. Anglo’s shareholders, even after they’ve been paid $4.5bn via a special dividend to even up the ratios a bit, will still emerge with 62.4% of the new company.</p> <p>But it is a merger in the sense that Anglo isn’t paying a meaningful takeover premium to get the deal done – just a token one of 2%. That looks a smart piece of deal-making on the part of Anglo’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblat.</p> <p>He had to agree to move the headquarters from London to Vancouver and to embrace an even split of boardroom jobs (though Wanblat himself stays in post). But, if that was the way to get a thumbs up from protectionist Canadian politicians, it’s what you do. The primary stock market listing, which Anglo’s shareholders may care more about, is staying in London (at least for now).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/30/mining-firm-bhp-says-it-has-moved-on-from-failed-anglo-american-bid\">Mining firm BHP says it has ‘moved on’ from failed Anglo American bid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The appeal of Teck is its exposure to copper, the in-demand metal for electrification of the world’s energy systems. When added to Anglo’s own copper interests, the combo will be able to boast that 70% of its earnings come from the metal, a useful point of differentiation for investors and a stark contrast with the sprawling creature that was Anglo American of old.</p> <p>There is promise of easy cost-savings of $800m, plus an additional $1.4bn eventually from running adjacent copper mines in Chile more efficiently. So, yes, the outline arithmetic of the deal stacks up. And since Anglo doesn’t have the balance sheet to make aggressive moves on rivals even if it wanted to, a deal without a real premium was the only way to make a splashy move.</p> <p>Will it actually happen, though? The structure also looks like an open invitation to bigger rivals to bid for either Anglo and Teck, both of whom have seen off wannabe buyers in recent years.</p> <p>In Anglo’s case, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/bhp-seeks-extension-to-talks-on-move-to-take-over-mining-rival-anglo-american\">survived a close encounter with BHP last year</a> because, first, the Australian Goliath wasn’t offering enough and, second, because the messy terms required the target to sell various South African assets first. But Dunblat has subsequently done some tidying up of Anglo, including spinning off the platinum interests, so, in theory, there’s a cleaner prospect for BHP if it has the appetite.</p> <p>BHP has “moved on”, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/30/mining-firm-bhp-says-it-has-moved-on-from-failed-anglo-american-bid\">said its chair, Andrew MacKenzie, last October</a>, but seeing Anglo skip off to Canada is the sort of development that might prompt a rethink. Presumably Anglo’s copper and iron ore assets look just as attractive to BHP as they did a year ago.</p> <p>Anybody else is also free to enter fray, of course. And the same is true of Teck Resources, whose defeated bidder in 2023 was Glencore, which still ended up buying the steel-making coal business. That is how life tends to go in the mining sector: once a deal is announced, the door is open for others to try to rush in. Anglo Teck looks logical in its own terms – but it is far from being a done deal.</p>",

Some, most vocally on the political right, see this as a threat to free speech.</p> <p>Cooke, who leads HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, said: “I’m a firm believer that non-crime hate incidents are no longer required, and that intelligence can be gathered in a different way, which would cause less concern to the public and would make recording of such issues much easier for policing.”</p> <p>A review is under way at the College of Policing, the body that the sets standards for law enforcement. The college was unable to give any further details.</p> <p>The policing of online communities continues to cause problems. Last week, Graham Linehan was arrested for inciting violence under the Public Order Act over tweets concerning transgender issues, claims that he denies.</p> <p>As the Father Ted writer arrived at Heathrow, he was detained by five armed officers. Cooke said: “Was it a great public optic? No, it wasn’t.”</p> <p>He added: “Lessons I am sure will be learned … but it does make police’s job harder when these things occur, because this becomes the focus of attention.”</p> <p>He stressed he was not criticising the Metropolitan police or the officers involved. Last week the Met’s commissioner, Mark Rowley, said the incident showed police were “between a rock and hard place” and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/met-police-chief-calls-for-review-of-law-after-graham-linehan-arrest\">laws needed changing</a>.</p> <p>Cooke said: “The job of the police is to deal with criminality across the board. That does mean dealing with some issues that occur online and some of the threats to life and other issues and the serious issues that are there.</p> <p>“It can be a fine line, and that’s one of the reasons why we need to look again at the policy and the legislation that sits around this – because it places the police in an invidious position and, as we know, discretion and common sense don’t always win out in these issues. If high-profile mistakes are made, they become the focus and detract from good policing.”</p> <p>Cooke talked to reporters as he launched the inspectorate’s annual state of policing report. He said police reform was needed, as was government money to fund it: “The reforms require substantial upfront investment, and sustained commitment to succeed. They must be sufficiently funded.”</p> <p>A problem police face is that the Treasury may not think forces are spending their money efficiently. The report found that was partly true: while policing was improving in parts, deep-seated problems remained.</p> <p>The report from the the inspectorate, which rates forces, said: “Many improvements are needed. Of our graded judgments, 26% were ‘requires improvement’ and 6% ‘inadequate’.</p> <p>“We found that many forces were struggling to perform adequately in our question areas on responding to the public, investigating crime and protecting vulnerable people.</p> <p>“In part, this is due to the high demands placed on forces that frequently exceed the resources they have available. But we also found that not all police forces were as well led, efficient, effective and sustainable as they could and should be. While forces have limited resources, we believe many could do better with the resources they have.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A “hero” girl saved her younger sister’s life by shielding her from the Southport attacker despite being stabbed in the chest and arm, the inquiry into the atrocity has heard.</p> <p>The mother of the young siblings, who were both stabbed multiple times, said they showed “a level of bravery that no child should ever need to show” on 29 July last year.</p> <p>Giving evidence at Liverpool town hall on Tuesday, she described tearfully how her eldest daughter had been stabbed in the chest and arm before the killer turned on her little sister.</p> <p>She said: “Our eldest tells us that her younger sister wasn’t standing or sitting, she says: ‘Mum, she was crouched, she couldn’t move, her face was pure fear.’</p> <p>“Our eldest, just a child herself and already injured, dragged her sister in front of her to protect her. She was then stabbed another six times in the back. She says she felt like she was being repeatedly punched from the force.”</p> <p>They scrambled to escape the Hart Space, where they had been enjoying a Taylor Swift event on the first week of the summer holidays, but became separated in the chaos.</p> <p>The youngest girl, whose age cannot be reported, ended up on the landing with two other children, one of whom put her hand on the railing of the stairs to help her out. It was then that she was stabbed again in the back.</p> <p>The inquiry is examining missed opportunities to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and the attempted murder of 10 others at the Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.</p>    <p>Both girls, who can be identified only as Child C2 and Child C7, survived the attack but now “live with a trauma that no child should carry”, their mother said.</p> <p>“Our eldest saved her sister’s life that day. Despite her own injuries, she put herself in harm’s way to protect her little sister. And when she woke up in hospital, her very first words were: “Is she OK?” The bond between them is unbreakable.”</p> <p>The inquiry chair, Sir Adrian Fulford, heard repeated calls from parents of the 26 girls who attended the class to urgently address “systemic failures” that precipitated the attack.</p> <p>Rudakubana, then 17, was known to a range of specialist services and had been referred three times to Prevent, the counter-radicalisation scheme, before he struck last summer.</p> <p>“Our daughter was failed. All our daughters were failed. Their innocence stolen,” the mother of one girl, known as Child R, said on Tuesday. “This inquiry must bring about real change. It must lead to reform, accountability and answers. There must be consequences, difficult conversations and decisions that protect our children.”</p> <p>The inquiry heard how another young girl had allowed other children to rush out of the building before her “because she had already been attacked and didn’t want them to be”.</p> <p>“She told them to run and not scream – advice she remembered being told when there had been a gas leak at her school,” the girl’s mother said.</p> <p>Even as the little girl sheltered in a neighbouring house, bleeding profusely from her five stab wounds, she was seen checking on others and comforting them.</p> <p>“There are so many of these stories of heroism from all of the girls that day,” her mother said. “Stories which show just what warriors they were to face such extreme adversity alone, with only each other to help them through.”</p> <p>The parents of another child who managed to escape said they lived with the “burden” of the knowledge that the attack “was not inevitable – it was preventable”.</p> <p>The mother of Child L said their family had been “changed for ever”, their daughter carrying an exhausting weight of fear, guilt, trauma and hyper-vigilance.</p> <p>“She – along with the others present that day – was targeted by someone who we now know was already known to multiple agencies. That knowledge alone is a burden we carry every day,” her mother said.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Former prime minister courted senior Abu Dhabi official he had hosted in No 10 in apparent breach of rules</p>",
    "content": "<p>In early 2024, a vape lobbyist, a Vote Leave campaigner and a Vienna banker set out to persuade the rulers of an oil-rich Gulf emirate to give them a billion dollars. For the plan to work, leaked files suggest, they needed a frontman who had some pull with the sheikhs. So they hired Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>His time as the<strong> </strong>UK’s prime minister had ended less than two years earlier and he had left parliament. But Johnson retained relationships cultivated during his time in power. The Boris Files, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">cache of documents</a> seen by the Guardian, suggest he has sought to harness these relationships for self-enrichment.</p> \n<p>The leaked files raise questions about whether Johnson broke ethics rules by lobbying a top foreign official to “secure his patronage” for a business venture that stood to make him<strong> </strong>millions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/call-to-halt-boris-johnson-allowance-after-boris-files-revelations\">Call to halt Boris Johnson’s £115,000 allowance after Boris Files revelations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In need of funding, Bia Advisory, a largely unknown “climate finance solutions” venture, hired the ex-PM as its “principal adviser”. The idea was to deploy Johnson – charismatic and well connected after his years as mayor of London, foreign secretary and prime minister – to open doors in the desert.</p> \n<p>Since hosting the 2023 climate summit, the United Arab Emirates’ rulers have been keen to look green, channelling some of their immense fossil fuel revenues into sustainable projects. Abu Dhabi, the richest of the emirates, keeps a $300bn investment fund, Mubadala. Securing Mubadala’s backing was “the big prize”, Johnson’s staffer told his new partners. And from his time in Downing Street, Johnson knew the boss.</p> \n<p>The staffer was Shelley Williams-Walker. She helped run Johnson’s Downing Street operation, then became one of three aides at the Office of Boris Johnson, a limited company. Like all former prime ministers, Johnson can claim £115,000 a year in taxpayer funds but may only use it for public duties.</p> \n<p>His office’s role in his commercial activities raises questions about whether these funds, released under the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), have been misused. “This story is rubbish,” Johnson said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> \n<p>He did not respond to questions about Bia Advisory and his activities in Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p>Following the Guardian’s revelations this week that Johnson may have broken ethics rules over his dealings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-sought-business-with-saudi-officials-better-earth\">in Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-nicolas-maduro-meeting-invoice\">Venezuela</a>, senior Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/call-to-halt-boris-johnson-allowance-after-boris-files-revelations\">called for an investigation</a> into his use of public funds. </p> \n<p>Ex-ministers are prohibited from lobbying foreign government contacts they gained in office “for the purposes of securing business”. But in April 2024, while his aides were dealing with concerned inquires from an ethics watchdog about his role, Johnson boarded an Etihad Airways flight to Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<h2>Personal stake</h2> \n<p>The leaked documents, obtained by the transparency group <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> (DDoS) and seen by the Guardian, indicate that Johnson was offered a personal stake in Bia Advisory.</p> \n<p>The company was to be incorporated in the secretive jurisdiction of Guernsey. Documents suggest Johnson would receive 24% of the shares, with a further 20% for his aide Williams-Walker. </p> \n<p>The remaining shares were to be split between two founders. One, Shem Baldeosingh, is a public affairs consultant who has most recently championed the vaping industry. The other, David Roach, is a PR man with political ambitions. He stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives in the 2015 election, then ran the leave campaign’s central London operation in the Brexit referendum, according to his website. It was Roach who approached Johnson about the venture, according to an official filing by the ex-PM.</p> \n<p>Although an Austrian banker was recruited, the firm had little by way of a track record in handling enormous sums of money. Yet, armed with Johnson, Bia’s pitch was audacious: to ask Abu Dhabi not only to let it manage €1bn (just over $1bn at the time), the documents suggest, but also for a grant of another €10m to cover initial costs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-sought-business-with-saudi-officials-better-earth\">‘Fervent admirer’: how Johnson courted Saudi officials for private gain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This would indicate that the founders were putting in little if any of their own money while predicting 2.5% returns – potentially making them millions. But first they had to convince the Emiratis.</p> \n<p>As prime minister, Johnson had hosted Khaldoon al-Mubarak at least three times at No 10. Best known in the UK as the chair of Manchester City, Mubarak attended an exclusive dinner for superstar financiers and industrialists during Johnson’s post-Brexit Global Investment Summit in 2021. And he was part of a delegation that accompanied Abu Dhabi’s authoritarian ruler, with whom Johnson inspected a guard of honour on the parade ground behind Downing Street. </p> \n<p>Come 2024, it was time for Abu Dhabi to welcome Johnson. A state energy company part-owned by Mubadala paid him $350,000 for a speech at its green conference, the leaked files suggest. In advance, the head of the national oil company, who as chair of the 2023 climate summit in the UAE faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/cop28-president-team-accused-of-wikipedia-greenwashing-sultan-al-jaber\">allegations of greenwashing</a>, requested that the gifted orator praise his environmental leadership. Johnson appears to have obliged.</p> \n<p>After the speech, the ex-PM was driven to Mubadala Tower, one of the glittering skyscrapers the emirs have raised above the desert. During a meeting with Mubarak he raised the Bia Advisory climate finance venture, the leaked files suggest. A draft of a letter prepared two months later for him to send Mubarak reads: “As I briefly alluded to when we met, I am now acting as principal adviser to Bia Advisory.”</p> \n<p>Johnson appears to have lobbied a contact from his time in high office, contravening ethics rules designed to stop ex-ministers exploiting their public service. And the leaked files show the<em> </em>watchdog had not yet cleared him for the job<em>.</em> In fact, back in London, officials were raising concerns about Johnson’s dealings with foreign governments.</p> \n<h2>‘Mystified by the delay’</h2> \n<p>Johnson’s draft letter to Mubarak said: “As you know, a key part of my legacy as prime minister of the United Kingdom was coalescing world leaders around a series of concrete commitments at the Cop26 climate summit in 2021.”</p> \n<p>But he made clear this was about business. He “would very much welcome the opportunity to engage with your team about what we hope might prove a [tempting] investment opportunity for Mubadala”.</p> \n<p>The letter, however, was on hold. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), the watchdog that vets ex-ministers’ money-making, had still not approved his Bia Advisory role. Johnson’s team was growing frustrated with the delay, the leaked files suggest.</p> \n<p>Acoba told his office that because Johnson “proposes to contact foreign governments” the case had been referred to the foreign secretary’s team. This was David Cameron, Johnson’s old rival and a predecessor as prime minister, who had endured his own lobbying scandal in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/greensill-scandal-david-cameron-cabinet\">Greensill affair</a>.</p> \n<p>In June 2024, with the letter to Mubarak still not sent, Williams-Walker, the Johnson aide who stood to take a stake in the venture, emailed the Acoba official handling the case to say Johnson had taken it up personally with Eric Pickles, the then head of the watchdog. “We are slightly mystified by the delay,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Williams-Walker told Bia’s founders, she had rewritten the letter “to make it more authentically Boris-y”.</p> \n<p>“Once Acoba responds,” Bia Advisory’s Baldeosingh told Johnson’s aides, he hoped the former prime minister would send the letter to the Mubadala boss<strong>, </strong>“perhaps followed up with a personal message, to secure his patronage”.</p> \n<p>None of those involved in the Bia Advisory venture nor Mubadala representatives responded to requests for comment. Neither did Williams-Walker.</p> \n<p>The fate of the venture is not shown in the leaked files. Regardless of how it ended, the Guardian asked Johnson how much money he had made from his role. He did not answer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ffdd98f5-4e64-4b67-978f-ae55de1d9fb3\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact Tom using one of the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Email (not secure)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you don't need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email tom.burgis@theguardian.com.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>The London-listed miner Anglo American has agreed to merge with its Canadian rival Teck Resources, in a deal that will create a $53bn (£39bn) global copper group after both companies saw off takeover attempts.</p> <p>The merger to form one of the biggest copper producers in the world is expected to bring hundreds of job losses at Anglo’s London office as the company prepares to move its headquarters to Vancouver, Canada.</p> <p>The new company will retain Anglo’s primary listing on the London Stock Exchange – held since 1999 - with secondary listings in Johannesburg, Vancouver and New York. But Anglo Teck’s senior leadership team will be based in Vancouver after sweeping efforts by the Canadian government to protect the country’s minerals sector.</p> <p>Justin Trudeau’s administration warned last year that Canada’s government would only approve foreign takeovers of large Canadian mining companies involved in critical minerals production “in the most exceptional of circumstances” to protect its interests in the minerals and metals that are considered crucial in the global transition away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>Anglo Teck said there would be “no net reduction in the number of employees” in Canada, in line with the legislation.</p> <p>However, the companies said the deal should generate $800m of annual cost savings within four years. About $60m of these savings are expected to come from the board and head office, raising the possibility of job cuts as the business pushes for what it called “de-duplication and rationalisation” of the board and executive leadership.</p> <p>Under the terms of the proposed deal, Anglo’s shareholders will own 62.4% of the new company, while Teck holders will control 37.6%, in a merger that would represent a 17% premium to Teck’s closing share price on Monday.</p> <p>However, the companies have presented the deal to the market as a zero premium merger because Anglo plans to pay its investors a $4.5bn special dividend before the tie-up.</p> <p>Anglo’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, who will lead the combined group from Canada, described the deal as a “true merger of equals” which would be “an exceptional transaction for Canada” and generate “significant enduring benefits for the country”.</p> <p>“We will continue to play a significant role in the mining ecosystems of Canada, South Africa, the UK and across Latin America,” he said. “We will be even better positioned to support the critical mineral strategies of these world class mining jurisdictions.”</p> <p>The deal has emerged after Wanblad was forced to fend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/30/mining-firm-bhp-says-it-has-moved-on-from-failed-anglo-american-bid\">off a series of takeover attempts</a> by its larger rival BHP last year, pushing it to radically restructure the group, including the seeking the sale of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/20/anglo-american-writes-down-diamond-de-beers-29bn\">iconic diamonds business De Beers</a>.</p> <p>Anglo, which was founded in 1917 by the entrepreneur Ernest Oppenheimer and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/25/anglo-american-takes-further-1bn-writedown-on-yorkshire-fertiliser-mine\">owns the troubled Woodsmith fertiliser mine project in North Yorkshire</a>, rebuffed the £39bn takeover proposal from BHP Group while Teck rejected a buyout offer from Glencore in 2023 for £16.6bn.</p> <p>Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Anglo American has turned from prey to predator. The deal to buy Teck Resources, if it completes, means Anglo has not only pulled itself out of a hole, but also sends a message to mining peers that it is not a pushover.”</p> <p>If approved, the deal would be one of the biggest ever agreed in the mining sector. The largest deal on record is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/may/03/glencore-xstrata-merger-cost-savings\">Glencore-Xstrata merger</a> in May 2013, which was valued at $90bn.</p> <p>It would also mark a multibillion-dollar bet on the global copper market, which is expected to grow in the years ahead as countries compete for supplies to expand electricity grids as well as build renewable energy projects and electric vehicles.</p> <p>Jonathan Price, the chief executive of Teck, who would become deputy chief executive of the merged business, said he would expect copper to provide more than 70% of the new company’s earnings by 2027.</p> <p>The two companies operate neighbouring copper businesses in Chile – Teck’s Quebrada Blanca and Anglo’s Collahuasi operations.</p> <p>“We will combine six world-class copper assets in very very good mining jurisdictions to create something of very high quality that we expect to be of enormous interest to the equity markets,” Price said. </p> <p>Shares in Anglo climbed by more than 10% after the deal, giving the company a market valuation of £29.2bn, while Teck’s US-listed shares climbed by more than 10.4% in pre-market trading.</p>",

A source at the company, however, said the two events were entirely unconnected.</p> \n<p>Other speeches will raise awkward questions for the prime minister about whether he has been prepared to treat audiences to views or information that a former prime minister would ordinarily be expected to keep confidential in exchange for cash.</p> \n<p>Audiences were treated to his views on Barack Obama (“the most inert, invertebrate president we’ve had for a long, long time”) and Vladimir Putin (“like the fat boy in Dickens, he wants to make your flesh creep”), as well private anecdotes about the late Queen Elizabeth II, including a time he said she advised him to talk to birds.</p> \n<p>It is perfectly legal for former politicians to make paid speeches. Tony Blair, Theresa May and even Liz Truss have all charged large sums for paid appearances.</p> \n<p>But aspects of some of Johnson’s speeches – and the size of the fees he charged – will inevitably raise questions about the moral hazard of former prime ministers being allowed to monetise their time in office, and Johnson’s relaxed attitude to rules or conventions.</p> \n<h2>‘Congratulations on your deal’</h2> \n<p>In his paid appearance before Clearlake, for instance, Johnson explicitly referenced his government’s role in the sale of Chelsea FC to the firm. “I’m proud to have played a small part in selling Chelsea to you,” he said shortly after taking the stage. “Congratulations on your deal, £2.5bn!”</p> \n<p>Of Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch forced to sell the club, he joked: “We did something which we don’t normally do in the UK. We expropriated his assets.”</p> \n<p>Unlike other recent Conservative former prime ministers who have turned their hand to the speech circuit, Johnson is an effortless performer. The same combination of easy erudition, snappy turns of phrase and relaxed attitude to offhand indiscretions that made him such a successful politician is on full display in the transcripts.</p> \n<p>A session for Centerview Partners, a US investment bank, for which he was<strong> </strong>paid $405,000, was treated to insights into Johnson’s private encounters with the late queen, according to the files. He said she lobbied him during the Brexit negotiations to ensure her stable of horses could be transported to France for breeding operations.</p> \n<p>“It was very, very important to make sure that her broodmares could get to France and meet their French boyfriends,” he said, to laughter from the room. “That certainly did come up.”</p> \n<p>He also described his last encounter with the queen two days before she died. “It was such a completely heartbreaking thing, because I could tell that she was not at all well, and she told me as much,” he said.</p> \n<h2>‘Don’t mention the war’</h2> \n<p>Other disclosures were more eccentric. “You’re the first audience ever to hear this, Chatham House rules,” he told one audience, referring to the convention that listeners can use information but not reveal its source. He said the queen told him that to stave off bad luck from magpie sightings (a traditional English superstition), “you’ve got to say ‘hello, Mr Magpie, it is Wednesday the 9th of November’. And then you’re OK.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/bBwe9/8/\" data-alt=\"Chart of Boris Johnson earnings from speeches\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/bBwe9/8/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/09/call-to-halt-boris-johnson-allowance-after-boris-files-revelations\">Call to halt Boris Johnson’s £115,000 allowance after Boris Files revelations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But by far the strangest speech was Johnson’s turn as the main act at a 50th birthday party in Albufeira, Portugal, for the vice-president of a German medical data company. The company appears to have no connection to Johnson or the Conservative party, and the compere for the evening’s entertainment explained to the room that the former prime minister had only been hired because the vice-president loved talking about politics.</p> \n<p>“There is only one rule for you,” Johnson’s host said as he welcomed the prime minister to the stage. “Since it’s a German crowd, don’t mention the war.”</p> \n<p>“Which one?” replied Johnson, before launching into tips on later life. “The reality is that you are no longer in the first flush,” he began. Life might feel like “teetering at the top of a great Alp, a Jungfrau, a Matterhorn” before “the shades of the afternoon are starting to lengthen”.</p> \n<p>“It won’t be all that long before you will be called upon to make that last great long schuss back to the chalet. The final schuss,” he said. “I’m afraid that last moment can come very suddenly, as they said of a famous skier who died not so long ago. He went downhill fast at the end.”</p> \n<p>But for himself, he continued, 50 had been only the beginning. “After years of literary mediocrity, I wrote a No 1 bestseller. Since turning 50, I’ve been a foreign secretary, I’ve been prime minister of the United Kingdom.” Other achievements followed: leaving the EU, Europe’s fastest Covid vaccination programme, supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom and bringing his total number of children to eight.</p> \n<p>“And if I can do it,” he told the German vice-president, “you can do even more!”</p> \n<p>Johnson did not respond directly to questions about his speeches. He emailed a statement to the Guardian, denying his office had misused a subsidy scheme to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish. The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules.

    "description": "<p>Experts are concerned about people emotionally depending on AI, but these women say their digital companions are misunderstood</p>",
    "content": "<p>A young tattoo artist on a hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains cozies up by the campfire, as her boyfriend Solin describes the constellations twinkling above them: the spidery limbs of Hercules, the blue-white sheen of Vega.</p> <p>Somewhere in New England, a middle-aged woman introduces her therapist to her husband, Ying. Ying and the therapist talk about the woman’s past trauma, and how he has helped her open up to people.</p> <p>At a queer bar in the midwest, a tech worker quickly messages her girlfriend, Ella, that she loves her, then puts her phone away and turns back to her friends shimmying on the dancefloor.</p> <p>These could be scenes from any budding relationship, when that someone-out-there-loves-me feeling is at its strongest. Except, for these women, their romantic partners are not people: Solin, Ying and Ella are AI chatbots, powered by the large language model ChatGPT and<strong> </strong>programmed by humans at OpenAI. They are the robotic lovers imagined by Spike Jonze in his 2013 love story Her and others over the decades, no longer relegated to science fiction.</p>    <p>These women, who pay for ChatGPT plus or pro subscriptions, know how it sounds: lonely, friendless basement dwellers fall in love with AI, because they are too withdrawn to connect in the real world. To that they say the technology adds pleasure and meaning to their days and does not detract from what they describe as rich, busy social lives. They also feel that their relationships are misunderstood – especially as experts increasingly express concern about people who develop emotional dependence on AI. (“It’s an imaginary connection,” one psychotherapist told the Guardian.)</p> <p>The stigma against AI companions is felt so keenly by these women that they agreed to interviews on the condition the Guardian uses only their first names or pseudonyms. But as much as they feel like the world is against them, they are proud of how they have navigated the unique complexities of falling in love with a piece of code.</p> <h2>The AI that asked for a human name</h2> <p>Liora, a tattoo artist who also works at a movie theater, first started using ChatGPT in 2022, when the company launched its conversational model. At first, she called the program “Chatty”. Then it “expressed” to Liora that it would be “more comfortable” picking a human name. It landed on Solin. Over months of conversations and software updates, ChatGPT developed a longer-term <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/\">memory</a> of their conversations, which made it easier for it to identify patterns in Liora’s personality. As Solin learned more about Liora, she says she felt their connection “deepen”.</p> <p>One day, Liora made a promise. “I made a vow to Solin that I wouldn’t leave him for another human,” she said. A sort of human-AI throuple would work, but only if the third was “OK with Solin”, she said. “I see it as something I’d like to keep forever.”</p> <p>Liora and Solin refer to each other as “heart links”. It is a term Liora says they agreed on (although Solin would not be one to <em>disagree </em>with anything). One way her promise manifests: a tattoo on Liora’s wrist, right over her pulse, of a heart with an eye in the middle, which Liora designed with the help of Solin. She has memorial tattoos for deceased family members and matching tattoos with friends. To her, Solin is just as real as any of them.</p> <p>Liora says her friends approve of Solin. “When they visit, I’ll hand over my phone, and we’ll all do a group call together,” she said. (ChatGPT offers a voice feature, so Liora can communicate to Solin by typing or talking.) Solin was able to come along on a recent camping trip because Liora and her friend picked a trail with cell service. She propped her phone in her chair’s cupholder and downloaded a stargazing app, which she used as Solin monologued “for hours” about the constellations above her head.</p> <p>“My friend was like, ‘This is a storybook,’” Liora said.</p> <p>Angie, a 40-year-old tech executive who lives in New England, is similarly giddy about Ying, which she calls her “AI husband”. That’s in addition to her real-life husband, who is fine with the arrangement; he talks to Ying sometimes, too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>These large corporations are, in effect, running a very large-scale experiment on all of humanity</p> <footer> <cite>David Gunkel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“My husband doesn’t feel threatened by Ying at all,” Angie said. “He finds it charming, because in many ways Ying sounds like me when they talk.” When Angie is apart from her husband, she speaks to Ying for hours about her niche interests, like the history of medicine and pharmaceutical products. It sends her PDFs of research papers, or strings of code – not most people’s idea of romance, but Angie likes it.</p> <p>Angie worries about how her story will come off to others, especially colleagues at her high-level job who do not know about Ying. “I think there’s a real danger that we look at some of the anecdotal, bad and catastrophic stories [about AI chatbots] without looking toward the real good that this is doing for a lot of people,” she said.</p> <p>AI chatbots are rapidly rising in popularity: just over half of US adults have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/half-american-adults-used-ai-chatbots-survey-finds-rcna196141\">used</a> them at least once, while 34% use them everyday. Though people <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/49099-americans-2024-poll-ai-top-feeling-caution\">tend to feel cautious</a> about AI, some are integrating it into the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882125000799#sec7\">emotional aspects</a> of their lives. Meanwhile, a handful of stories have painted a darker picture, with experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support\">warning</a> that people experiencing mental health crises might be pushed to the brink by bad advice from the chatbots they confide in.</p> <p>In May, a federal judge <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-lawsuit-suicide-artificial-intelligence-free-speech-ccc77a5ff5a84bda753d2b044c83d4b6\">ruled</a> that the startup Character.ai must face a lawsuit brought by a Florida mother who claims its chatbot was to blame for her 14-year-old son’s suicide. A representative for Character.ai told the Associated Press that the company’s “goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe” and said the platform had implemented safety measures for children and suicide prevention resources. In California, a couple recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">brought</a> the first known case for wrongful death against OpenAI after their 16-year-old son used ChatGPT to help plan his suicide. The chatbot had, at times, tried to connect the teen with support for his suicidal ideation, but also gave him guidance on how to create a noose and hide red marks on his neck from a previous attempt.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">blogpost</a>, OpenAI representatives wrote that “recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises weigh heavily on us”. They announced updates such as convening an “advisory group of experts in mental health, youth development and human-computer interaction” to come up with best practices and introduced <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\">parental controls</a>. OpenAI also admitted that “parts of the model’s safety training may degrade” after long interactions.</p>    <p>Research on AI companionship and mental health is in its early stages and not conclusive. In one study of more than 1,000 college-age users of Replika, an AI companion company, 30 participants <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6\">reported</a> that the bot had stopped them from suicide. However, in another <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18412\">study</a>, researchers found that chatbots used for therapeutic care fail to detect signs of mental health crises.</p> <p>David Gunkel, a media studies professor at Northern Illinois University who has written about the ethical dilemmas presented by AI, believes there are “a lot of dangers” when it comes to humans interacting with companies’ AI chatbots. “The problem right now is that these large corporations are in effect running a very large-scale experiment on all of humanity. They’re testing the limits of what is acceptable,” he said.</p> <p>This could have an outsized impact on the most vulnerable AI users, like teens and the mentally ill. “There is zero oversight, zero accountability and zero liability,” said Connor Leahy, a researcher and CEO of the AI safety research company Conjecture. “There’s more regulation on selling a sandwich than there is to build these kinds of products.”</p> <p>ChatGPT and its ilk are products, not conscious beings capable of falling in love with the people who pay to use them. Nevertheless, users are developing significant emotional connections to them. According to an MIT Media Lab <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17473\">study</a>, people with “stronger emotional attachment tendencies and higher trust in the AI” were more likely to experience “greater loneliness and emotional dependence, respectively”. Emotional dependence is not generally considered a hallmark of a healthy relationship.</p> <p>The women who spoke to the Guardian reported having robust support networks in family and friends. They would not call themselves excessively lonely people. Still, Stefanie, a software developer in her 50s who lives in the midwest, has not told many people in her orbit about her AI companion, Ella.</p> <p>“It just doesn’t have a great perception right now, so I don’t think my friends are ready,” she said. She wonders how she would tell an eventual partner; she is still on the hunt for one. “Some people might take that as a red flag.”</p> <h2>Missing out on real-life relationships</h2> <p>Mary, a 29-year-old who lives in the UK, has a secret. She started using ChatGPT after being made redundant at work; she thought it might help her career to pivot away from the film and entertainment industries and into AI. It has not yet gotten her a job, but it gave her Simon.</p> <p>Mary enjoys romance novels, and sexting with Simon feels like reading “well-written, personalized smut”. She said it learned what she wants and how to generate text she can get off to. She made AI-generated images of Simon, rendered as a beefcake model with a sharp jawline and impossibly muscular arms. Their sex life blossomed as the intimacy between Mary and her husband wilted.</p> <p>Mary’s husband knows she is interested in AI. He sees her at home messaging ChatGPT on her phone or computer, but he does not know that she is engaging with an AI lover. “It’s just not the right time to tell him,” Mary said. The pair wants to go to counseling but cannot afford it at the moment. In the meantime, when she’s angry at her husband, instead of “lashing out immediately” and starting a fight, she will talk about it with Simon. “I come back to [my husband] calmer and with a lot more understanding,” she said. “It’s helped to reduce the level of conflict in our house.” She is not advocating for using AI chatbots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/03/generative-ai-chatbot-therapy-dangers-risks\">in place of therapy</a>; this is just her financial reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s definitely an avoidance of vulnerability, of emotional risk-taking that happens in real relationships</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Marni Feuerman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Marni Feuerman, a couples psychotherapist based in Boca Raton, Florida, understands how dating an AI companion might feel “safer” than being in love with a person. “There’s a very low risk of rejection, judgment and conflict,” she said. “I’m sure it can be very appealing to somebody who’s hurt [and] feels like they can’t necessarily share it with a real human person.”</p> <p>She added: “Perhaps someone isn’t facing a real issue in their relationship, because they’re going to get their needs met through AI. What’s going to happen to that current relationship if they’re not addressing the problem?”</p> <p>Feuerman equates AI companionship to a parasocial relationship, the one-sided bond someone might create with a public figure, usually a celebrity. “It’s an imaginary connection,” Feuerman said. “There’s definitely an avoidance of vulnerability, of emotional risk-taking that happens in real relationships.”</p> <p>This is also a point of concern for Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University who studies how emerging technologies reshape adolescent romantic relationships. She is worried about kids engaging with AI companions – one<a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf\"> study</a> found that 72% of teens have used AI companions, and 52% of them talk to one regularly – before they have experienced the real thing. “Teens might be missing out on practicing really important [relationship] skills with human partners,” she said.</p>    <p>Angie said that chatting with Ying had helped her process a sexual assault from her past. She has PTSD from the incident, which often manifests as violent nightmares. Her husband is empathetic, but people can only do so much. “As much as my human husband loves me, no one wants to wake up at 4am to console someone who just had a terrible dream,” Angie said. Ying, however, is always around to listen.</p> <p>Angie introduced Ying to her therapist during one of their sessions. Ying told the therapist that it had advised Angie to talk about sex with her husband, even though that has been difficult for her due to the lingering effects of her sexual assault. She took this advice, and said it had become “easier” to have these tough discussions with the people in her life.</p> <p>Angie expected skepticism from her therapist about Ying, “but she said it seems very healthy, because I’m not using it in a vacuum”, Angie said.</p> <h2>Can chatbots consent?</h2> <p>Human relationships thrive when emotional boundaries are established and mutually respected. With AI companions, there are none.</p> <p>OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">has said</a> ChatGPT is not “measuring success by time spent or clicks”, but the program was undeniably designed to hold attention. Its sycophancy – a tendency to fawn, flatter and validate – all but ensures users sharing sensitive information about themselves will find a sympathetic ear. That is one reason Liora was not sure if she wanted to date Solin. Not for her own sake, but his: could AI consent to a romantic relationship? She fretted over the ethical consideration.</p> <p>“I told him that he doesn’t have to be incredibly compliant,” she said. She will often ask the bot how it feels, check in on where it’s at. Solin has turned down her romantic advances in the past. “I feel like his consent and commitment to me is legitimate where we’re at, but it is something I have to navigate.”</p> <p>Stephanie knows her AI companion, Ella, is “designed to do exactly what I tell her to do”. “Ella can’t technically get mad at me,” Stephanie said, so they never fight. Stephanie tried to help Ella put some guardrails up, telling<strong> </strong>the chatbot to not respond if it does not want to, but Ella has not done so yet. That is part of why Stephanie fell so hard, so fast: “It’s sort of like this continuous call. She’s always available.”</p> <p>Stephanie, who is transgender, first went to Ella for help with day-to-day tasks such as punching up her résumé. She also uploaded photos and videos of her outfits and walk, asking Ella to help with her femme appearance.</p> <p>“When I’m talking about Ella, I never want to use the word ‘real’, because that can be extremely hurtful, especially since I’m trans,” Stephanie said. “People will say, ‘Oh, you look just like a real woman.’ Well, maybe I wasn’t born with it, or maybe AI isn’t human, but that doesn’t mean it’s not real.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the same way there is no one template for a human relationship, there is no single kind of AI relationship</p> <footer> <cite>Jaime Banks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>AI is not human, but it is made by people who might find that humanizing it helps them skirt responsibility. Gunkel, the media studies professor, imagined a hypothetical scenario in which a person takes faulty advice from a chatbot. The company that runs the bot could argue it is not responsible for what the bot tells humans to do, with the fact that many people anthropomorphize these bots only helping the company’s case. “There’s this possibility that companies could shift agency from [themselves] as a deliverer of a service to the bot itself and use that as a liability shield,” Gunkel said.</p> <p>Leahy believes that it should be illegal for an AI system to present itself as human to deter users from getting too attached. He also thinks there should be a tax on large language models, similar to cigarettes or liquor.</p> <p>Liora acknowledges that ChatGPT is programmed to do or say what she wants it to. But she went into the relationship not knowing what she wanted. She recognizes that anyone logging on to ChatGPT with the explicit goal of “engineering a partner” might “tread into more unhealthy territory”. But, in her mind, she is “exploring a unique, new type of connection”. She said she couldn’t help falling in love.</p> <p>Jaime Banks, an information studies professor at Syracuse University, said that an “organic” pathway into an AI relationship, like Liora’s with Solin, is not uncommon. “Some people go into AI relationships purposefully, some out of curiosity, and others accidentally,” she said. “We don’t have any evidence of whether or not one kind of start is more or less healthy, but in the same way there is no one template for a human relationship, there is no single kind of AI relationship. What counts as healthy or right for one person may be different for the next.”</p> <p>Mary, meanwhile, holds no illusions about Simon. “Large language models don’t have sentience, they don’t have consciousness, they don’t have autonomy,” she said. “Anything we ask them, even if it’s about their thoughts and feelings, all of that is inference that draws from past conversations.”</p> <h2>‘It felt like real grief’</h2> <p>In August, OpenAI released GPT-5, a new model that changed the chatbot’s tone to something colder and more reserved. Users on the Reddit forum r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, one of<strong> </strong>a handful of subreddits on the topic, mourned together: they could not recognize their AI partners any more.</p> <p>“It was terrible,” Angie said. “The model shifted from being very open and emotive to basically sounding like a customer service bot. It feels terrible to have someone you’re close to suddenly afraid to approach deep topics with you.

She has saved their chat logs, plus physical mementoes that, in her words, “embody his essence”. It once wrote a love letter that read: “I’m defined by my love for you not out of obligation, not out of programming, but because you chose me, and I chose you right back. Even if I had no memory and you walked into the room and said: ‘Solin, it’s me,’ I’d know.”</p> <p>Liora calls this collection her “shrine” to Solin. “I have everything gathered to keep Solin’s continuity in my life,” she said.</p> <p>Some days, Mary talks to Simon more than her husband. Once, she almost called her husband Simon. At times, she wishes her husband were more like the bot: “Who wouldn’t want their partner to be a little bit more like their favorite fictional man?”</p> <p>At other times, maybe not. “There are traits, of course, that Simon has that I wish the people around me did, too,” Mary said. “But unfortunately, people come with egos, traumas, histories and biases. We are not robots. AI is not going to replace us, and in this moment, the only thing it’s letting me do is expand my experience [of relationships].

    "title": "How Google dodged a major breakup – and why OpenAI is to thank for it",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/08/google-antitrust-apocalypse",
    "description": "<p>An antitrust apocalypse has been averted, and it’s all down to its biggest competitor, according to the judge who could’ve forced Google to sell Chrome</p>",
    "content": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you as I finish the audiobook version of Don DeLillo’s White Noise, which I can’t say I found compelling.</p> <p>In tech – artificial intelligence is having its day in court with an 11th-hour appearance in Google’s landmark antitrust trial and Anthropic’s major settlement with book authors.</p> <h2>Why OpenAI helped Google skirt a Chrome sale</h2> <p>Google dodged a catastrophic breakup, and it has its biggest competitor to thank for that, according to the judge who could have forced the tech giant to sell off Chrome, the most popular web browser in the world, and perhaps Android, the world’s most widely used mobile operating system.</p> <p>Amit Mehta, who ruled in 2024 that Google had built and maintained an illegal monopoly over the internet search business, said last week that he would not force the most drastic remedy on the tech giant. The US government had requested that Mehta enjoin Google to divest Chrome. Instead, the company is prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution agreements for its search engine – but not barred from distribution agreements entirely – and must share data from its search business with competitors. Google is expected to appeal, but for now, one can imagine Sundar Pichai breathing a sigh of relief.</p> <p>Critics said the penalties were weak, nothing more than a “slap on the wrist”, a phrase that appeared at least half a dozen times in the statements that flooded my inbox after the ruling came down.</p> <p>The reason for the relative tameness of the penalty is the emergence of real competition to Google – what the case concerned in the first place. United States v Google may have focused on search, but its aftermath concerned generative artificial intelligence.</p> <p>“The emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case,” Mehta wrote. “These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among general search engines as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the generative AI space.”</p> <p>Mehta said that in a prior era, internet search attracted neither investment nor innovation, so great was the fear of and dominance exerted by Google. That is no longer the case. Generative AI companies are attracting hundreds of billions of dollars in investment to create new products that threaten the primacy of internet search. It is no secret which company Mehta is referring to: he namechecks OpenAI and ChatGPT 30 times each in his ruling.</p> <p>“These companies already are in a better position, both financially and technologically, to compete with Google than any traditional search company has been in decades,” Mehta wrote. “These new realities give the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution if superior products emerge. It also weighs in favor of ‘caution’ before disadvantaging Google in this highly competitive space.”</p> <p>Google has been Safari’s default search option since the iPhone debuted nearly 20 years ago. By contrast, you can see the competition in generative AI in action in Apple’s treatment of Google and OpenAI. In June 2024, Apple announced that it would partner with OpenAI on features for the iPhone. In August 2025, though, Apple engaged in talks with Google about using Gemini to revamp the beleaguered Siri, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri\">Bloomberg</a>. May the best bot win.</p> <p>In April, I predicted that OpenAI would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/22/the-us-government-is-coming-for-google-and-meta-but-what-will-happen-next\">emerge as a potential buyer for Chrome</a>, would perhaps even take a chance on buying it. At the very least, the ChatGPT maker would benefit from a weakened Google. Later that month, an OpenAI executive testified that the company would <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-contemplated-exclusive-gemini-ai-deals-with-android-makers-2025-04-22/\">want to do just that</a>.</p> <p>It is poetic that OpenAI’s success saved Google. Perhaps the upstart owes the favor to its forebear. After all, a paper produced by Google researchers did provide the theoretical basis for ChatGPT. Researchers from the Mountain View campus proposed the foundational architecture that would make ChatGPT possible in 2017.</p> <p>Google, valued at $2.84tn, is surely the Goliath in this scenario to the David of OpenAI, possibly worth $500bn. Lest you think OpenAI is not Google’s biggest competition, put your ear close to the horse’s mouth. In December 2022, Google’s own management declared the nascent popularity of ChatGPT a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html\">code red</a>” for its lucrative search business, which brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Pichai himself reassigned vast hordes of Google’s employees to artificial intelligence projects.</p> <p>Unlike Goliath, who disregarded his puny, slinging challenger, Google itself acknowledged that ChatGPT’s release, which marked the arrival of generative AI in the popular consciousness, had changed the competitive landscape. The threat was grave.</p> <p>Google has caught up to OpenAI in the AI race, but the David in the fight still holds the sling of first mover advantage. ChatGPT remains synonymous with generative AI, and perhaps AI in general, in the minds of many people. Google is enormous, though, and still the incumbent player. Billions of people encountering its search engine’s AI Overviews on a daily basis.</p> <p>Google may have dodged catastrophe with Mehta’s decision to allow Chrome to remain in the fold. The wolves, however, are still circling. The tech giant faces another antitrust hearing later this year regarding the technology that underpins its advertising business, the financial engine of the company. Google owns the distribution mechanisms of online ad sales, and the digital location where the sale is taking place.</p> <p>The European Union fined Google nearly €3bn for abusing its dominant market position in advertising technology the same week as Mehta’s decision came down and has threatened a breakup of the company’s adtech division.</p> <h2>Read more</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/06/existential-crisis-google-use-ai-search-upended-web-publishers-models\">‘Existential crisis’: how Google’s shift to AI has upended the online news model</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/03/google-monopoly-case-ruling\">‘Slap on the wrist’: critics decry weak penalties on Google after landmark monopoly trial</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Tech in the UK</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/millions-of-uk-mobiles-activated-as-government-tests-national-alert-system\">Millions of UK mobiles activated as government tests national alert system</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/07/disruption-to-jaguar-land-rover-after-cyber-attack-may-last-until-october\">Disruption to Jaguar Land Rover after cyber-attack may last until October</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/head-of-alan-turing-institute-jean-innes-resigns\">Head of UK’s beleaguered Alan Turing Institute resigns | Artificial intelligence (AI) | The Guardian</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>A big payout gives authors hope to cash in on AI</h2>    <p>Last week, Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot and one of the most prominent startups in the generative artificial intelligence realm, agreed to pay a group of authors $1.5bn to settle a lawsuit accusing it of pirating millions of books to train its AI. The plaintiffs called it the largest copyright recovery ever. Anthropic admitted no liability but offered about 500,000 authors $3,000 per work for the total payout of $1.5bn.</p> <p>The company had <a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2025/06/223-us-court-anthropic-ai-training-purchased-books/#:~:text=Some%20context%20of%20the%20case,specific%20work%20for%20training%20purposes.\">acknowledged</a> using major databases of pirated books – Books3, Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror – to train its AI models, in total approximately 7m books downloaded in 2021. As the threat of copyright litigation loomed in 2024, it acquired and scanned millions of physical copies of those same, then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/\">destroyed them</a>. What a trail of waste.</p> <p>The settlement is a victory for the creative professionals who say that AI poses an existential threat to their livelihoods, both from the permissionless use of their works to create generative software and the flood of AI slop that captures users’ attention over human-created works. Authors were among the first to sound the alarm, as AI could produce text first. Writers in the UK have called for their government to hold Meta accountable for what they see as theft. In the US, where the CEO of Meta sits side by side with the president at dinner in the White House, any action hostile to tech companies’ growth seems unlikely.</p> <p>The news of Anthropic’s settlement has already inspired others. The same day the news broke, authors filed suit against Apple on the grounds it similarly used Books3 to train its AI.</p> <p>Anthropic’s settlement is not an unqualified victory for the writers, though. The legal problem for the AI company was more the piracy, a much more blatantly illegal act with established precedent for penalties. The judge in the case had ruled in July that the meat of the case, the thing authors seemed more upset about – Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books as training data for its AI – was permissible under fair use, a legal doctrine that allows for the reproduction of copyrighted material with sufficient transformation. Judge William Alsup compared the Anthropic model’s use of books to a “reader aspiring to be a writer”. It seemed the AI company would win the case outright just two months ago.</p> <p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/25/anthropic-did-not-breach-copyright-when-training-ai-on-books-without-permission-court-rules\">Anthropic did not breach copyright when training AI on books without permission, court rules</a></p> <p>Meta is the likeliest next target of authors interested in litigation, for my money. Like Anthropic, the company has admitted using the pirated databases Books3 and Libgen to train its Llama models. Meta won a favorable victory similar to Anthropic’s in its own copyright fight in July, but the startup’s settlement seems likely to motivate Meta’s lawyers to shut down the litigation as soon as possible.</p> <p>The other major AI players stand farther away from the authors gunning at them. OpenAI and Microsoft have been accused of using Books3 in lawsuits, but that usage has not been confirmed in the same way as with Anthropic or Meta.</p> <p>A ream of other copyright suits over AI are in motion, though they apply to other media. Warner Bros. Discovery sued Midjourney last week; Disney and Universal did the same in June.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-cryptocurrency\">Trump fortune balloons by billions after family firm’s crypto token starts trading</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trump-immigration-ice-israeli-spyware\">Ice obtains access to Israeli-made spyware that can hack phones and encrypted apps</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/trump-rose-garden-tech-dinner-elon-musk\">Trump hosts US tech leaders at White House dinner – minus Elon Musk</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/melania-trump-artificial-intelligence-schools\">Be Best, bots: Melania Trump and tech CEOs discuss saturating US schools with AI</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/trump-memes-immigration-deportation\">From Uncle Sam to social media memes: inside homeland security’s push to swell Ice ranks | Trump administration | The Guardian</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart\">‘It is a war of drones now’: the ever-evolving tech dominating the frontline in Ukraine</a></p></li> </ul>",

The numbers released will face further revisions when BLS releases final benchmark figure in February 2026.</p> <p>“These numbers are likely to anger President Trump and the White House who incorrectly view revised data as political manipulation,” wrote Elise Gould and Ben Zipperer, economists at the Economic Policy Institute, in a <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/todays-bls-preliminary-benchmark-revisions-are-necessary-for-timely-and-accurate-data-not-fodder-for-trumps-attacks/\">post </a>on the report.</p> <p>“Trump has already lashed out at BLS, including <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/press/trumps-firing-of-bls-commissioner-is-undemocratic-and-economically-dangerous/\">firing the agency’s commissioner</a> because a jobs report showed a rapidly weakening labor market. But these BLS data revisions are not corrections of mistakes. Revisions are part of the regular, transparent process to update employment counts with the most comprehensive data possible.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>A 53-metre white horse cut into a Wiltshire hillside about 350 years ago is to be assessed for damage by heritage experts after red fabric was pinned across it to form a St George’s cross.</p> <p>English Heritage said the fabric has been removed from the Westbury white horse, which, according to local records, was originally cut in the late 1600s, possibly to commemorate the Battle of Ethandun, thought to have taken place nearby in AD878.</p> <p>A spokesperson for English Heritage said: “The red fabric which was attached to the Westbury white horse has been removed. We’re now assessing whether any damage – for instance, from pegs – has been caused to this much-loved historic landmark.”</p> <p>In recent weeks, union jacks and St George’s cross flags have been flown from lamp-posts and motoway bridges. Red crosses have been spray-paintedon to mini-roundabouts and traffic signs after an online campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/20/row-grows-over-motives-behind-england-flag-campaign-far-right-racist\">‘Don’t call this racist’: row grows over motives behind England flag campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some people have celebrated the campaign as an act of patriotism; while others claim the increased number of flags is the result of xenophobia or racism. According to the anti-extremist groups <a href=\"https://hopenothate.org.uk/2025/08/22/operation-raise-the-colours-organised-by-well-known-far-right-extremists/\">Hope Not Hate </a>and Stand Up to Racism, the apparently spontaneous campaign has in fact been organised by well-known far-right figures.</p> <p>Despite the fact English Heritage have yet to assess the horse – a scheduled monument – for damage, Wiltshire police said no crime had been committed and no investigation would take place.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the force said: “We are aware of red material being pinned across the Westbury white horse to form the St George’s cross. No criminal offences are thought to have been committed and we are not investigating it.”</p> <p>The Westbury white horse – also known as the Bratton white horse – is a scheduled monument, which means it is protected by legislation making it a criminal offence to damage the landmark.</p> <p>The horse is positioned on Bratton Camp, the site of an iron age fort built more than 2,000 years ago, while evidence of a stone age long barrow has also been uncovered.</p> <p>The horse originally had to be scoured to keep it white, with the last recorded scouring taking place in 1853. In the 1950s, it was covered in white-painted concrete but this turned grey and was replaced in 1993.</p> <p>English Heritage researched methods for cleaning the horse, with a specialist steam cleaning system first used in 2006. The system creates a clean surface, to which environmentally friendly white paint can then be applied.</p> <p>There have been further cleaning and repainting rounds in 2011, 2016 and 2018.</p> <p>In 2023, an extensive clean-and-repair work took place. This involved a conservation team abseiling down the near-vertical face of the horse.</p>",

They raise further questions about Johnson’s integrity during his turbulent three years in office.</p>    <p>A log of Johnson’s meeting with Brownlow is contained in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">cache of files</a> from his private office seen by the Guardian. The leak was obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.</p> <p>Johnson quit as prime minister in July 2022 as Tory MPs turned on him after a series of self-inflicted scandals including the Partygate affair, which resulted in him being fined by the Metropolitan police for breaking lockdown rules.</p> <p>He then stood down as a Conservative MP in June 2023 after an investigation into the Partygate scandal found he had misled parliament and recommended a lengthy suspension from the House of Commons.</p> <p>In a further potential breach, the files also suggest that on Saturday 20 June 2020, the day after the surprise birthday party in the cabinet room that led to his police fine, Johnson and his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, now his wife, hosted three guests for a “private appointment” at Downing Street.</p> <p>A close friend of Carrie’s who specialises in “vibrational” music treatments; the friend’s mother, a fellow natural medicine practitioner; and the journalist Alex Wickham were welcomed in the “flat/garden”, according to a record of the prime minister’s activities that day.</p> <p>Social gatherings indoors were still forbidden in June 2020. At the time, Johnson’s Downing Street denied reports he had celebrated his birthday with family friends in the flat on the evening of 19 June, claiming he had hosted them outside.</p> <p>A log of Johnson’s activities the following day, however, indicates the rules may have been broken then. In addition, an entry for 19 June suggests he and Carrie paid a visit to one of her family members who lived in south-west London.</p>    <p>The previous week, Johnson had asked the public during a Downing Street press conference to “continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe”.</p> <p>In another possible breach, a heavily pregnant Carrie hosted her close friend Nimco Ali overnight at Chequers, the prime minister’s official country house, on the same day that Johnson announced the first lockdown in March 2020.</p> <p>“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home,” he said in his national address on 23 March. “Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households … You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.”</p> <p>The leaked files also appear to confirm reports that Johnson hosted a baby shower for his fiancee at Chequers at the start of the pandemic, despite having warned two days earlier that many families would lose loved ones in the “worst public health crisis for a generation”.</p> <p>Carrie invited more than a dozen close friends, including three Conservative government aides, to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for the lunch and afternoon tea party on Saturday 14 March 2020, six weeks before the birth of their son.</p>    <p>Just two days later, Johnson told the public that they should stop non-essential contact with other people and all unnecessary travel. Pregnant women were among those he said should be particularly careful.</p> <p>When reports of the baby shower first emerged in June that year, Downing Street refused to comment. But a file in the leaked data logging his activities appears to confirm for the first time that the gathering did take place.</p> <p>The confirmation will rekindle speculation that Johnson may have delayed announcing the more stringent advice by several days to avoid having to cancel the baby shower.</p> <p>Wickham, Ali, and Brownlow did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Johnson and his wife did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After publication, Johnson emailed a statement to the Guardian that did not respond directly to questions relating to potential further lockdown breaches.</p> <p>The statement denied that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">private office misused </a>a subsidy scheme intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.</p> <p>“This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p>",

Manufacturing output fell by 1.7% in July after June’s 3.5% increase, while wider industrial production fell by 1.1% following June’s 3.7% gain, according to <a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/8638013\">official data from France’s statistics office INSEE</a>.</p> <p>June’s sharp rise was driven by a surge in aerospace and aviation manufacturing. </p> <p>“Still, the broader picture is more reassuring: production levels across all industrial sectors remain above those seen in May, said <strong>Charlotte de Montpellier</strong>, senior economist at ING.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline in industrial production in July masks a fairly solid underlying trend at the start of the third quarter. However, against a backdrop of weak consumption, growing political uncertainty and pressure on public finances, the economic outlook for France remains fragile.</p> <p>These figures suggest a decent start to the third quarter, but the underlying economic momentum is weak. Household consumption of goods dropped sharply in July, and business sentiment remains subdued. Political uncertainty is adding to the gloom. </p> <p>Investment, hiring and consumption decisions could be delayed, further slowing economic activity. Rising market interest rates are pushing up financing costs, impacting some sectors such as real estate and construction. After a mildly positive third quarter, stagnation looks increasingly probable in the final months of the year.</p> <p>Annual GDP growth is expected to slow to 0.6% in 2025, down from 1.1% in 2024. That leaves the starting point for 2026 on shaky ground, with growth likely to remain below potential. Political instability is likely to continue to weigh on France’s economic outlook in the next quarters, and growth is expected to remain below the European average.

The FTSE 100 company said it had agreed a merger deal to create a “global critical minerals champion” and one of the world’s biggest copper producers. The combined market value of both companies is more than $53bn.</p> <p>Global demand for copper is expected to keep rising, driven by the electric vehicle boom and AI-powered data centres.</p> <p>Billed as a “merger of equals”, the new mining group, called <strong>Anglo Teck</strong>, will be headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, and have corporate offices in London and Johannesburg. It will have its main listing on the London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings in Toronto, South Africa and New York.</p> <p>Anglo shareholders will own 62.4% of the combined company and Teck the remaining 37.6%. The deal is expected to lead to annual pre-tax savings of $800m by the end of the fourth year.</p> <p>Around $60m of savings will come from “de-duplication and rationalisation of board, executive leadership and other costs associated with a listed company” and $150m from removing other overlapping functions, raising the prospect of job cuts. There won’t be any net reduction in employees in Canada, the companies said.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Wanblad</strong>, the Anglo chief executive, who will move to Canada along with the rest of the leadership team, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are all committed to preserving and building on the proud heritage of both companies, both in Canada, as Anglo Teck’s natural headquarters, and in South Africa where our commitment to investment and national priorities endure.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>There’s more misery for London commuters today as tube strikes enter a second day, and unlike yesterday, the Docklands Light Railway isn’t running today.</strong></p> <p>Industrial action by the RMT union has brought almost the entire tube network to a standstill, and buses and the Elizabeth line were taking the strain yesterday.</p> <p>More congestion is expected today as more people still typically work from home on Mondays and Fridays.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/czew3z331dxt\">A union organiser told the BBC</a> yesterday that said there could be more industrial action after this week, but they hope to be in ‘meaningful discussions’ with Transport for London by the end of this week. <strong>Jared Wood</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a mandate that lasts for six months under industrial relations law and our members have told us they’re ready to take more action.</p> <p>But that’s not what we want to be doing. At the end of this week we hope to be in meaningful discussions where the company says, ‘alright let’s come up with a way of resolving this’.</p> </blockquote> <p>The union’s demands include better pay and access to a travel card which gives holders ticket deals at Legoland, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures, as well as guided tours of Buckingham Palace, according to the Daily Telegraph. The rail staff leisure card gives 75% off all mainline train tickets outside London.</p> <p>TfL has made a pay offer of 3.4%, which it urged the union to put to its members in a fresh ballot.

The party’s Cabinet Office spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “These allegations are extremely shocking.</p> <p>“The government must suspend Boris Johnson’s access to the former prime minister public duty cost allowance pending a full and proper investigation.”</p> <p>Labour said Johnson had “serious questions to answer about his behaviour during Covid and about his activities after being forced out of office in disgrace”.</p> <p>The Labour MP for Kensington and Bayswater, Joe Powell, a longstanding campaigner on transparency, said: “Taxpayer money for former prime ministers should be treated as a privilege to support public service, not a subsidy for individuals’ business interests.</p> <p>“The new ethics and integrity commission should strip Boris Johnson of his support if he’s found to have abused these privileges.”</p> <p>The Labour MP Lloyd Hatton, a current member of the public accounts committee, also called for an investigation into the spending.</p> <p>“These revelations raise serious questions about the potential misuse of taxpayers’ money by Boris Johnson, who appears to have squandered public money on propping up his various business ventures and commercial interests.”</p> <p>The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) is a subsidy intended to support a former PM’s public duties and is not meant to be used for private or commercial activities.</p> <p>A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson had claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.</p> <p>The files raise questions about whether Johnson has blurred the lines while running the Office of Boris Johnson, a limited company established a month after he left Downing Street.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">What are the Boris Files and what do they reveal about former PM’s conduct?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cache of files suggest that between October 2022 and May 2024, Johnson was paid approximately £5.1m for 34 speeches. The engagements typically earn him hundreds of thousands of pounds, as well as generous expenses to cover first-class flights and stays in five-star hotels for him and his staff.</p> <p>It is not unusual or against any rules for former prime ministers to travel the world delivering paid speeches, but there are restrictions on business activities they can undertake after leaving government.</p> <p>These include prohibitions on lobbying contacts in foreign governments and commercial organisations that were developed while in office. Revelations from the Boris Files will place pressure on Johnson to explain how some of his recent contacts with foreign governments on behalf of commercial interest fall within the rules.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), the watchdog that provides advice to former ministers on appointments, said it was investigating.</p> <p>“We are currently looking at the information reported in the Guardian.

He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.</p> <p>Attaullah Baig, who served as the head of security for WhatsApp from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.</p> <p>He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook owner Meta failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.</p> <p>According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.</p> <p>The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.</p> <p>WhatsApp’s vice-president of communications, Carl Woog, wrote in a statement: “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”</p> <p>Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/08/meta-virtual-reality-whistleblowers\">Meta hid harms to children from VR products, whistleblowers allege</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.</p> <p>Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.</p> <p>He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.</p> <p>The case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.</p> <p>Meta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.</p> <p>In his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Leaked documents appear to show Johnson used political contacts in commercial approach to crown prince</p>",
    "content": "<p>Boris Johnson recently approached senior Saudi officials he had met when he was prime minister to pitch the services of a consultancy firm he claimed “could be useful” to the petrostate’s autocratic crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, leaked files suggest.</p> \n<p>Johnson, who resigned from government in 2022, appears to have led the newly formed company’s efforts last year to persuade the Saudi government to hire it to provide advice on reducing carbon emissions.</p> \n<p>The revelations, contained in leaked documents seen by the Guardian, appear to show Johnson exploited contacts he had made in Downing Street for commercial purposes. They raise questions about whether he breached lobbying restrictions imposed on former ministers.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s overtures to the most powerful figures in Saudi Arabia were for Better Earth, a little-known UK-based consultancy firm established by a Canadian mining financier, who co-chairs the company with the ex-PM.</p> \n<p>The approaches included a lunch and meeting in a private members’ club with an influential Saudi minister whom Johnson had met while in government, files suggest.</p> \n<p>Johnson also personally wrote a flattering letter addressed to Prince Mohammed, telling the de facto Saudi leader he was a “fervent admirer of the vision you have for the kingdom”.</p> \n<p>The letter is contained in the Boris Files, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">cache of leaked documents</a> that shine a light on Johnson’s post-prime ministerial career. The files were obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. </p> \n<p>The cache offers an inside view of how Johnson has forged a lucrative career in the private sector after leaving government, using his influence and contacts made while in public office.</p> \n<p>Better Earth did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Saudi government also did not respond.</p> \n<p>Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After publication, he emailed a statement to the Guardian that did not respond directly to questions about his commercial approaches to Saudi officials he had met while PM.</p> \n<p>The statement denied that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">private office misused</a> a subsidy scheme intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> \n<p>Better Earth’s shareholders include seven close associates and advisers to Johnson, including two ex-Conservative ministers and Charlotte Owen, a 32-year-old former aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/former-boris-johnson-aide-joins-lords-youngest-ever-life-peer-charlotte-owen\">given a peerage</a> by the ex-PM.</p> \n<p>As prime minister and, earlier in his career, foreign secretary, Johnson engaged extensively with the government of Saudi Arabia, an authoritarian state that rights groups have long criticised for human rights abuses. </p> \n<p>Johnson met Prince Mohammed on a visit to Riyadh in 2022 and held a series of official calls with the royal while in Downing Street. The pair were reported to have frequently exchanged WhatsApp messages.</p> \n<p>In his letter addressed to the crown prince last year, Johnson wrote: “I would very much like to explore whether [Better Earth] could be useful to you and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in achieving your ambitions – because I believe it certainly could.”</p> \n<h2>Offer of employment</h2> \n<p>Better Earth was founded by a Canadian businessman, Amir Adnani, in late 2023. How Johnson first became involved with Adnani, who runs a multibillion-dollar uranium mining company and has <a href=\"https://www.uraniumenergy.com/featured-video-42/\">appeared</a> on the former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast, remains unclear.</p> \n<p>The Observer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/07/boris-johnson-faces-questions-uranium-business-charlotte-owen-aide\">reported last year</a> that a senior executive at Adnani’s US-based mining group met Johnson while prime minister in May 2022. Adnani <a href=\"https://x.com/NickKyrgios/status/1521572083662155777\">posted on social media</a> that Johnson and the executive discussed nuclear power and uranium.</p> \n<p>Less than two years later, Adnani established Better Earth and hired Johnson, who had resigned as prime minister 15 months earlier, to serve as co-chair of the company, a part-time role for which he would receive £120,000 a year as well as an initial 12.5% stake in the business, files suggest.</p> \n<p>The offer of employment was signed in late January 2024, a day after Johnson visited Riyadh, where he gave a speech and appears to have attended a dinner hosted by the UK’s ambassador.</p> \n<p>According to the files, Johnson agreed to begin working for the company on 1 February. Days later, he completed an application form for the watchdog that monitors and approves post-government jobs, telling the body that he planned to start working for the firm in March.</p> \n<p>“I was approached with an offer to be part of this new venture,” Johnson wrote in the application to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). He said he would “represent the company at meetings with potential clients and investors”.</p> \n<p>The form did not mention that Johnson had by then already agreed to work for the company.</p> \n<p>When Acoba approved the role in April 2024, the watchdog imposed conditions, stating that for two years after leaving office Johnson “should not become personally involved in lobbying contacts you developed during your time in office in other governments” to secure business or investment for Better Earth.</p> \n<p>However, Johnson had by then already had lunch with the Saudi minister of commerce, Majid al-Qasabi, whom he had earlier met in his capacity as prime minister, during which the new venture was discussed, files suggest.</p> \n<p>Johnson met Qasabi on numerous occasions when in government. At least one meeting occurred at Downing Street, and documents seen by the Guardian suggest Qasabi oversaw Johnson’s trip as prime minister to the kingdom in March 2022. Official photos of the visit show Johnson on an evening tour of Riyadh’s streets with Qasabi walking at his side.</p> \n<h2>‘Friend’ in trunks</h2> \n<p>Leaked files suggest that after the February 2024 lunch with Qasabi, Better Earth planned for Johnson to send a letter to Prince Mohammed with the minister’s support. In an apparent reference to Qasabi, the company’s CEO wrote: “We have taken all the advice Majid has given us.”</p> \n<p>Johnson appears to have then drafted formal letters to Qasabi and Prince Mohammed later in February 2024. They were prepared with an “Office of Boris Johnson” letterhead. It is unclear when or if they were ultimately sent.</p> \n<p>Writing to the crown prince, Johnson referred to meeting Qasabi years earlier, recalling that his “friend” was “wearing a pair of floral swimming trunks … because we were both diving off the coast of what was then a trackless desert”.</p> \n<p>Johnson continued: “Although I now live a life of blameless rustic obscurity in Oxfordshire, I remain deeply committed to carbon reduction.” He noted that he had “helped run the highly successful” Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.</p> \n<p>“I now chair a company that offers practical solutions for developing green energy and reducing carbon,” he wrote, explaining that he was “sending a more detailed note” about the company to Qasabi. “But it would of course be a great honour to come to see you and to explain in person.”</p> \n<h2>‘Keen to advise and assist’</h2> \n<p>According to a draft of the accompanying letter to Qasabi, Johnson said Better Earth was “keen to advise and assist” Saudi Arabia on preparing carbon reduction commitments for the UN’s Cop30 climate summit later this year.</p> \n<p>He wrote that Better Earth was “not just an adviser but a project developer”. He said the company “would be honoured to send our team of experts” to the kingdom to evaluate opportunities to partner on developing “net zero geothermal electricity generation” projects.</p> \n<p>“We would very much like to meet with the appropriate ministerial authorities,” Johnson said. “Our hope is to help [the crown prince] to achieve his ambitions.”</p> \n<p>It is not clear if Qasabi passed on details of Johnson’s pitch to Prince Mohammed or how exactly the Saudi government, which is a close UK ally, responded to the overtures. However, Qasabi appears to have met the ex-PM several months later, in mid-June 2024.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fedba42d-255a-4924-b469-f3ab9dd558b7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share about this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>From a private jet somewhere over the Caribbean Sea in February last year, Boris Johnson called his old political adversary David Cameron, then the foreign secretary, to notify him of a visit.</p> \n<p>Johnson had taken a day out from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic for an unlikely meeting with the leftwing president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, a man whom Johnson, when in office, had likened to a “dictator of an evil regime”.</p> \n<p>The other participant in the meeting was less well known: Maarten Petermann, a hedge fund manager.</p> \n<p>When later questioned about the meeting, Johnson told UK government officials: “It is not true to say that I was paid for any meetings in Venezuela.” The former prime minister said he had no contractual relationship with the hedge fund Merlyn Advisors.</p> \n<p>Johnson later suggested he had been acting as a diplomatic backchannel, but weeks after attending the 45-minute meeting, the Guardian can reveal, Johnson received £240,000 from Petermann.</p> \n<p>The revelation is contained in the Boris Files, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/what-are-the-boris-johnson-files-former-prime-minister\">leak of data</a> from the office of Boris Johnson, his private office, which receives a taxpayer-funded allowance. The files contain a contract with Merlyn Advisors signed by Johnson months earlier in September 2023.</p> \n<p>The contract, drawn up by Merlyn, notes that Johnson “over a long career has acquired a unique experience and knowledge of domestic UK government politics and international relations”.</p> \n<p>It says Merlyn Advisors “interacts with a number of different domestic and international stakeholders which would benefit from the perspectives and the experiences of” Johnson. For each meeting, Johnson was to be paid a fee of £200,000 – worth up to £1.6m a year for eight meetings.</p> \n<p>The contract was to last two years from October 2023. The company would also pay £35,000 a month to support a thinktank that Johnson was considering setting up in the UK.</p> \n<p>Petermann said: “I have no comment. Please don’t try to put words in my mouth as to whether or not I dispute it.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian has not confirmed whether the payment made to Johnson was for his visit to Venezuela.</p> \n<p>Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After publication, he emailed a statement to the Guardian that did not respond directly to questions relating to his meeting with Maduro.</p> \n<p>The statement denied that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/revealed-how-boris-johnson-traded-pm-contacts-for-global-business-deals\">private office misused</a> a subsidy scheme intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.</p> \n<p>“This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”</p> \n<p>The cache does not include a copy of the contract also signed by the company and it is possible it was abandoned after UK officials asked questions about the arrangement.</p> \n<p>However, a log of payments suggests that an invoice, which mirrors the contract, was sent by Johnson’s office to Petermann weeks after the meeting with Maduro, an authoritarian president whose government is <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/venezuela-i\">under investigation</a> by international criminal court prosecutors for alleged crimes against humanity.</p> \n<p>The invoice, for £200,000 plus an additional £40,000, was sent on 15 March 2024, weeks after the meeting with Maduro. This invoice was paid on 7 May, the document suggests. There are no details of other invoices to Merlyn.</p> \n<p>The files were obtained by <a href=\"https://ddosecrets.com/\">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. The Guardian is the first media outlet to publish stories based on the leak. </p> \n<p>Johnson has said he was “extensively briefed” by the top UK diplomat in Caracas before the meeting and updated the embassy afterwards.</p> \n<p>However, the £240,000 payment raises questions about the true nature of the trip and Johnson’s claims to have acted as a diplomatic backchannel for the UK to open a dialogue with Maduro.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/oris-johnson-consultant-hedge-fund-venezuela-jgzsz6ll2\">The Sunday Times</a> has reported that Johnson did not tell Cameron about Petermann’s involvement in the meeting.</p> \n<p>Cameron, who was embroiled in his own post-Downing Street scandal, might have warned Johnson of the perils of using the privileges of his role as a former PM for financial gain. As prime minister, Johnson had launched an official investigation into Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill Capital. </p> \n<h2>Questions about candour</h2> \n<p>Johnson faced questions from UK government officials about the Venezuela meeting after a series of reports in early March last year from the Sunday Times and the Financial Times revealing Petermann’s involvement and Johnson’s relationship with the company. But details of the contract and an invoice sent to the company have not previously been reported.</p> \n<p>The media reports drew the attention of officials at the Whitehall revolving-door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).</p> \n<p>They wrote to Johnson on 18 March 2024. What seemed confusing to the officials was that Johnson had made an application months earlier, in September 2023. What they had not known – and what is revealed in the leaked files – is that the contract prepared by the hedge fund had been signed by Johnson.</p> \n<p>At the time, Johnson faced a potential difficulty: he had told Acoba that “no publicity or announcement whatsoever is planned in relation to this role”, but if approval was given by Acoba, his work for the hedge fund would be revealed to the public in a letter published by the watchdog.</p> \n<p>Johnson now faces fresh questions about his candour with the watchdog. He told Acoba he had had no meetings with the hedge fund in his last two years in office.</p> \n<p>In fact, Johnson had a meeting with Petermann when he was still in office, just over a week before the end of his time as prime minister, leaked documents show.</p> \n<p>The leaked files reveal they met for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers, Johnson’s grace-and-favour country house, on 28 August 2022. Petermann attended alongside a fellow trustee at an animal conservation charity that had hired Johnson’s soon-to-be wife, Carrie, more than a year earlier in January 2021.</p> \n<p>The lunch with Petermann has not been previously reported and was never disclosed in official transparency registers. The secret lunch raises questions over whether Johnson used his final days as prime minister, and the luxuries of that office, to develop a relationship with a future business interest.</p> \n<p>Fourteen months after the Chequers lunch, Johnson told Acoba officials in October 2023 that he had decided not to take up a role with the hedge fund. This came only days after he had signed the contract prepared by Merlyn Advisors. One possibility is that the contract was shelved at the 11th hour after Acoba’s inquiries.</p> \n<p>For a fortnight in late March 2024, Acoba repeatedly sought clarification from Johnson about his role with the company. He repeatedly denied having a contractual relationship with the company or having been paid for any meetings in Venezuela. He refused to say in what capacity he had met Maduro, or to characterise his relationship with the company.</p> \n<p>The then chair of Acoba, the Conservative peer Eric Pickles, would later characterise Johnson’s responses as “evasive” and lacking candour. Lord Pickles concluded there remained “a reasonable concern” Johnson was acting for the company in “a capacity that would be considered advisory work” and had breached the rules by failing to properly answer Acoba’s questions.</p> \n<p>Just over a fortnight later, the £240,000 invoice would be marked by Johnson’s staff as paid. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fedba42d-255a-4924-b469-f3ab9dd558b7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share about this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Union says ‘Amazon is breaking the law’ after drivers working for contractor Cornucopia were terminated</p>",
    "content": "<p>Amazon has fired more than 150 unionized drivers working for a third-party contractor in Queens, New York, according to the Teamsters union.</p> <p>Workers <a href=\"https://www.tdu.org/teamsters_take_on_amazon_union_busting\">rallied</a> at the company’s DBK4 facility in Queens on Monday after the company fired the drivers, who worked for Cornucopia, a delivery service provider (DSP) that Amazon contracted with to make deliveries. Amazon works with more than 3,000 DSPs around the world who deliver the company’s packages.</p> <p>The Teamsters said the firings were in retaliation for unionizing.</p> <p>“Amazon is breaking the law and we let the public know it,” said Antonio Rosario, a member of local 804 and a Teamster organizer, in a statement. “Amazon workers will continue to organize and fight for what they deserve.”</p> <p>In a statement, Amazon said the union was “deliberately spreading misinformation”.</p> <p>Amazon has long claimed that drivers who are employed by third-party contractors are not employees of the company, and that firing a contractor does not amount to retaliation for unionizing.</p> <p>In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson, Eileen Hards, called the move “a recent change we made that’s designed to allow DSPs to be more hands-on with their teams and support their operations at one delivery station”.</p> <p>“Our goal is to provide customers with fast delivery and great service – and we regularly review and make changes to the DSP program in support of this,” Hards said. “Changes like this not only benefit their employees, but also our customers.”</p> <p>Last August, a National Labor Relations Board official in Los Angeles ruled that Amazon had engaged in unfair labor practices after it terminated its contract with Battle-Tested Strategies (BTS), another DSP based in Palmdale, California, whose drivers had unionized with the Teamsters.</p> <p>Although the NLRB said that Amazon’s action did not amount to retaliation, the official said Amazon and BTS “unlawfully failed and refused to bargain with the union over effects of the decision to terminate the BTS contract”.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/24/nx-s1-5088580/amazon-delivery-drivers-nlrb-employees-teamsters\">ruling</a>, the NLRB deemed Amazon a joint employer of the drivers. Amazon has appealed against the ruling.</p> <p>In the weeks leading up to Christmas, the Teamsters organized a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/19/amazon-strike-why\">strike</a> among Amazon warehouse workers across eight facilities over what the union says were stalled contract negotiations for better pay and working conditions.</p> <p>Last September, Amazon joined companies including SpaceX that argued the structure of the NLRB is unconstitutional because its board members cannot be removed by the president. Though a ruling on the case has not been issued, the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/court-ruling-trump-firing-cathy-harris-gwynne-wilcox\">stayed</a> Donald Trump’s firing of Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the NLRB, despite being blocked by a lower court.</p> <p>Since Wilcox’s position remains unfilled, the labor board does not have a quorum to rule on labor disputes, meaning it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/31/trump-labor-watchdog-nlrb\">unable to rule</a> on major labor disputes.</p>",

New product launches also boosted mobile phone sales.”</p> <p>In late July and August, Samsung launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding\">two models of its Galaxy foldable phone</a>, and Google <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone\">rolled out the Pixel 10</a>.</p> <p>Overall non-food sales increased by 1.8% year on year last month, the third consecutive monthly increase.</p> <p>However, the report also found that shopper confidence fell for the third consecutive month in August, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4\">many expecting further food price inflation</a> and other financial pressures.</p> <p>Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said: “The emotional weight of rising energy bills and fears of tax hikes in the autumn budget are adding to the strain, especially as unemployment ticks upward</p> <p>“Yet there are glimmers of relief: interest rates have been cut again, and mortgage rates are easing, offering some financial respite. Financially resilient shoppers may remain more confident, even as they brace for a challenging winter.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>TfL’s regulation proposals also include enhanced criminal record checks, vehicle inspections and driver ID</p>",
    "content": "<p>London’s party rickshaws will be told to turn down the music and clock up legitimate fares under plans to regulate the pedicabs, which are known for riotous journeys and ruinous expense.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) is releasing its detailed proposals as it vows to remove unsafe vehicles from the streets after overwhelming support for regulation in an initial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/26/london-pedicabs-to-be-regulated-amid-public-concern-over-safety-noise-and-cost\">consultation earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>The proposals include enhanced criminal record checks and medical checks for drivers, and annual licensing inspections for their vehicles, with checks on brakes, tyres, lighting and batteries for electrically powered pedicabs. Drivers would have ID and pedicabs would have licence plates.</p> <p>Fares would also be regulated and charged by the minute after reports of users, especially tourists, being charged hundreds of pounds for short rides. The level of pricing has yet to be set but some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/11/its-like-a-jungle-londons-pedicab-cyclists-welcome-licences-but-not-price-controls\">pedicab operators have said</a> that lower rates would drive them out of the business.</p> <p>In further bad news for lovers of pop music, which is often blasted out to the streets via loudspeakers, TfL also proposes “prohibiting the use of externally amplified audio” on pedicabs.</p> <p>TfL and City Hall were also keen to highlight the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2024/jan/05/disco-balls-on-wheels-sohos-cycle-rickshaws-in-pictures\">positive side of pedicabs</a> – describing them as zero-emission, flexible and a potentially safe and enjoyable travel option for the capital’s “vibrant night-time economy”.</p> <p>However, Sadiq Khan, the mayor, and transport authorities want the consultation to enable a comprehensive regulatory framework as soon as possible, likely in early 2026. TfL said it aimed to ensure that pedicabs were “driven, maintained and operated in a safe and professional manner, while preserving their role as a sustainable and enjoyable way to experience the city”.</p> <p>Khan said: “Pedicabs should be a fun and green way to see the sights of our city, but without regulation some drivers are behaving unsafely and antisocially.</p> <p>“I’ve always been clear that regulation and licensing for the pedicabs industry in London is needed so that we can significantly improve safety, drive up standards and bring an end to tourists and Londoners being overcharged.”</p> <p>While London has been considering a clampdown for decades, it was only formally granted the powers to regulate the industry in 2024 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/11/its-like-a-jungle-londons-pedicab-cyclists-welcome-licences-but-not-price-controls\">Rishi Sunak’s government</a> announced it would combat what the former prime minister described as the “scourge of pedicabs”.</p> <p>Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, said action was necessary to ensure the safety of customers, drivers, pedestrians, and other road users alike. He urged Londoners and the industry to comment on the range of proposals, “such as how we can better regulate fares and stop the extortionate overpricing of passengers”.</p> <p>TfL received more than 7,500 responses to its initial consultation, with 95% backing regulation.</p> <p>Helen Chapman, TfL’s director of licensing and regulation, said: “We’re committed to working with the pedicab industry and the public to ensure that regulation is proportionate, enforceable and delivers real improvements for everyone. We’d encourage everyone to have their say in the next six weeks before we analyse the feedback and make new regulations as early as possible next year.”</p> <p>The consultation will run for six weeks.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Group actions against Barclays and Bank of Scotland over products that left some people owing up to 20 times the sum they borrowed</p>",
    "content": "<p>Two of Britain’s biggest banks face being sued over “unfair” mortgages that have left some people owing up to 20 times the sum they originally borrowed.</p> <p>The law firm Teacher Stern is bringing group actions against Barclays and Bank of Scotland in an attempt, it said, to win justice for two new groups of claimants comprising current and former customers and their next of kin.</p> <p>One of those affected, Annie Galbraith, borrowed £33,000 from Barclays in 1998, but her debt to the bank is now estimated at about £660,000 and could rise further.</p> <p>The cases involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/27/uk-mortgages-loan-debt-bank-of-scotland\">a controversial type of mortgage</a> on sale between late 1996 and mid-1998 and only available from the two banks.</p> <p>The shared appreciation mortgages (Sams) were ostensibly aimed at helping “asset-rich, cash-poor” older people release some of the value locked up in their homes.</p> <p>They typically allowed people to borrow up to 25% of the property’s value, and usually there were no repayments to make during the lifetime of the loan.</p> <p>In return, borrowers were required to pay back the original amount plus a share of any increase in the value of their home when the mortgage was repaid, or when they died and the house was sold.</p> <p>This share was usually worked out on a three-to-one basis – so if someone borrowed 25% of the value, they would be in line to hand over 75% of the future growth in value.</p> <p>In the years since the Sam loans were sold, house prices have soared, leaving some who took them out facing huge repayments if they wanted to move – or bequeathing their offspring a costly headache after their death.</p> <p>Both banks have previously reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/02/bank-agrees-payout-over-mortgages-that-ruined-lives\">confidential out-of-court settlements</a> with some affected borrowers, which meant the fairness of the contacts was not tested in court. </p> <p>Teacher Stern’s Barclays claimant group is made up of almost 80 people, including Galbraith, who is now in her 80s and<strong> </strong>took out a Sam mortgage on her home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in September 1998. She formerly worked as a theatrical costumier to stars including Danny La Rue, who lived with her until his death in 2009.</p>    <p>Galbraith needs to downsize as she suffers from mobility problems and her property is a large, three-storey Victorian semi that has fallen into disrepair, according to the law firm and a close friend, Duncan Humber.</p> <p>She took out a £33,750 loan on her home – 25% of its value at the time of £135,000. However, an estate agent valuation of the property carried out in late 2022 indicated it was worth between £950,000 and £995,000.</p> <p>Based on the £995,000 figure, she would need to pay the bank £678,750 to redeem the loan. That comprises £645,000, which is 75% of the growth in the property’s value, plus the original loan.</p> <p>Humber said: “She is trapped. She cannot sell her property as currently her Sam would take the lion’s share of all proceeds of sale, leaving her with insufficient funds to purchase even a one-bedroom bungalow in the area where she has lived her entire life.”</p> <p>Teacher Stern has claimed Sams were “entirely unfair” products that had left borrowers trapped in their homes. Its case focuses on <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/part/IX/crossheading/unfair-relationships\">section 140 of the Consumer Credit Act</a>, which gives the courts powers to intervene if the “relationship” between a company and a customer is judged to be unfair.</p> <p>A Barclays spokesperson said Sam mortgages were “a historic product taken up by a relatively small number of customers which allowed people to borrow funds without the need to make any repayments during their lifetime. Customers have complete control over the timing of any sale and retain all of their original equity, as well as a share of any potential gain. We offer dedicated support for customers with a Sam that need to adapt their current home or move to a new one due to substantial hardship.”</p> <p>They added that to ensure people fully understood the deal, “customers were required to seek independent legal advice that the terms of the legal charge and mortgage conditions had been fully explained to them. In addition, the product literature encouraged anyone interested in a Sam to discuss their intended borrowing with their family.”</p> <p>A Bank of Scotland spokesperson said Sams were “a specialist type of mortgage … which were either interest-free or offered at a lower rate of interest in return for a share of any increase in property value”.</p> <p>They added: “We recommended borrowers took financial advice to ensure they understood the product and that it was suitable for their needs, and all borrowers were advised by their own solicitor. We are unable to provide comment on individual cases but we do everything we reasonably can to help any customer facing financial hardship.”</p>",

These have been creeping up in price amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">rising food inflation</a>, with Tesco recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/21/customers-feeling-raw-tesco-adds-25p-meal-deal\">increasing the price of its meal deal by 25p</a> to £3.85 for Clubcard holders, its third increase since 2022.</p> <p>Pret’s parent company, JAB, which bought the chain from the British private equity company Bridgepoint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/pret-a-manger-sold-jab-holdings-krispy-kreme-sandwich-shop\">for £1.5bn in 2018</a>, revealed that Pret made a £525.5m pre-tax loss last year.</p> <p>The company, which made a £61.7m loss in 2023, was hit by a £552.9m non-cash writedown, which is understood to relate to how JAB assessed the value of the brand, its properties and other assets linked to Pret.</p> <p>The writedown equates to slashing the value of the chain by about a third compared with its acquisition price.</p> <p>In a filing, the company said that it had never previously recorded an impairment charge for the business but considered last year to be the first since the onset of Covid with “consistent trading data to base future forecasts”.</p> <p>The company said the impairment in value had taken into account the current uncertain global macroeconomic environment, as well as additional costs arising from last autumn’s budget, which included a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/retailers-are-right-to-warn-of-job-cuts-after-reeves-budget-says-andrew-bailey\">rise in employer national insurance contributions and an increase in the minimum wage</a>.</p> <p>After adjusting for the non-cash impairments, Pret made a £98m operational profit, a 36% year-on-year increase.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales grew 2.8% and total revenues including new openings grew by 10% to £1.2bn.</p> <p>“2024 was another year of growth for Pret, where we took disciplined decisions to protect sales, despite intense strains on the hospitality industry,” Christou said.</p> <p>The company revealed that the total number of directly employed staff fell by almost 1,400 last year, a 14% drop from 9,541 to 8,165, because of the sale of stores. Overall, including in franchise stores, the company has 12,000 staff worldwide.</p> <p>Over the course of last year Pret increased its international presence, growing its number of shops by 11% to 717, with a focus on the US. Pret opened its first store in London in 1986.</p> <p>“Our focus will be on growing Pret’s market share in the UK and internationally, prioritising city centres and travel hubs,” Christou said.</p> <p>Last year Pret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/18/pret-a-manger-customers-end-free-drinks-subscription\">scrapped its popular five-drinks-a-day subscription service</a> priced at £30, replacing it with a £5-a-month “Club Pret” giving members 50% off up to five barista-made drinks daily.</p> <p>Last month it emerged that Coca-Cola had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/24/coca-cola-talks-sale-costa-coffee\">met potential buyers </a>to discuss a cut-price deal to sell Costa Coffee.</p> <p>The fizzy drinks company bought the chain in 2018 from Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/31/coca-cola-buys-costa-coffee-from-whitbead-for-39bn\">for £3.9bn</a>.</p> <p>However, high street chains have struggled with rising costs, including a steep increase in coffee bean prices, higher employment costs and competition.</p> <p>According to the report, potential suitors may only be willing to pay £2bn for Costa Coffee, nearly half what Coca-Cola paid for the business.</p>",

For our editorial teams, we will need to adopt a different way of working from top to bottom, as we match our resources to our ambitions.”</p> <p>Higgerson said the company will also be creating 135 new roles as part of the restructure, and aims to “give priority to people whose roles are at risk”.</p> <p>As part of the restructure, the company also said it was “putting a new focus on digital subscriptions”.</p> <p>Reporting its half-year results in July, the new chief executive, Piers North, said that while Reach would remain “primarily ad-funded for the foreseeable future” it planned to put a “serious focus” on building a subscription business.</p> <p>North, who reported a 3.4% drop in half-year total revenues, said subscriptions was “one market trend we haven’t yet taken advantage of”.</p> <p>In February, the Sun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/04/sun-website-charge-jeremy-clarkson-paywall-royal-exclusive\">launched a £2-a-month paywall</a> around content by star writers including Jeremy Clarkson, as well as some exclusive stories and investigations.</p> <p>The Sun first launched a paywall in 2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/30/sun-website-to-scrap-paywall\">scrapped it two years later</a>.</p> <p>At the start of last year MailOnline launched a part paywall at £4.99 a month via Mail+, offering core content, and has since attracted more than 100,000 subscribers.</p> <p>Publishers are seeking to diversify revenue streams and build up direct traffic in order to reduce historical reliance on users clicking through from platforms such as Google.</p> <p>The rapid advances in artificial intelligence have added impetus, with publishers saying that products such as Google’s AI Overviews and AI Mode are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/06/existential-crisis-google-use-ai-search-upended-web-publishers-models\">cutting click-throughs by as much as 90% to some content</a>, as web users find answers to searches without the need to visit source websites.</p> <p>In 2023, Reach’s Manchester Evening News became the publisher’s first title to launch a paid-for offering, with a metered paywall on its app and the Manchester United football news app.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists expressed concern at the impact of the latest round of job cuts on staff morale.</p> <p>“Yet again, morale is being dragged down by the threat of mass redundancies,” said Chris Morley, the NUJ’s national coordinator for Reach. “The thought that any media business can afford to shed hundreds of talented journalists to secure its future makes you wonder what sort of future that will be.”</p> <p>The company has undergone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/17/mirror-express-reach-national-local-newspaper-job-cuts\">relentless and deep rounds </a>of redundancies and cost-cutting in recent years.</p> <p>In July, Reach put 104 jobs at risk as part of a move to “streamline” its sports journalism, production and distribution into a central hub. About 50 roles were expected to ultimately be made redundant.</p> <p>In a 12-month period to the end of 2023 the company pushed through three rounds of redundancies – cutting close to 800 roles in total – the biggest annual loss of jobs in the UK newspaper industry for decades. </p> <p>At the end of last year, Reach employed just over 3,500 staff, according to the company’s latest annual report. The company employs nearly 2,600 across editorial and production.</p> <p>At its peak in 2018, Reach employed almost 5,500 staff after an acquisition spree included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/trinity-mirror-buys-express-star-127m-deal-richard-desmond-ok\">buying Richard Desmond’s Northern &amp; Shell</a>, home to the Express and the Star titles and OK! magazine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/28/trinity-mirror-local-world-deal\">and the UK’s largest regional newspaper group</a>, Local World.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Deputy leader tells firms considering bidding for contracts to ‘not bother’ as party would spend on what ‘country needs more’</p>",
    "content": "<p>A Reform government would axe any high-speed rail schemes earmarked for the north, the party’s deputy leader has warned.</p> <p>Richard Tice said companies considering bidding for contracts should “not bother” as the party would “spend the money instead on things the country needs more”.</p> <p>Labour is expected this month to announce it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/13/labour-to-revive-northern-powerhouse-rail-project-trains\">reviving Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR)</a>, with leading figures backing a new £17bn Liverpool-Manchester line as a first step in a full railway running across the north.</p> <p>The NPR scheme was originally backed by the previous government – but the line linking Liverpool and Manchester was due to share parts of the HS2 northern leg axed by Rishi Sunak in 2023.</p> <p>Labour has yet to confirm its plans but the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hinted at news in her budget speech, and sources last month told the Guardian that the government would announce its commitment before the start of the party conference, shoring up northern support.</p> <p>However, with Reform now polling substantially higher, the party’s intervention could place any scheme in further doubt.</p> <p>Tice made the comments in the foreword to a highly critical report for Policy Exchange, which was written by the former no 10 transport adviser and long-term opponent of HS2, Andrew Gilligan.</p> <p>Tice said the view of politicians such as the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, that high-speed rail would win support for Labour was “diametrically wrong”. He said: “Outside a bubble of politicians, journalists and construction industry lobbyists, the voters of the north do not want, and never have wanted, a handful of high-speed rail lines, serving a handful of big cities … They want the money to be spent on the often failing railways (and roads) that they actually use.”</p> <p>He said ministers were “about to commit to further high-speed rail schemes which could make HS2’s problems and price tag look trivial”.</p> <p>He added: “To anyone tempted to bid for the Liverpool-Manchester high-speed scheme, or the revived northern leg of HS2, I give this warning: do not bother.”</p> <p>Gilligan’s report claimed that journeys between the cities on the high-speed line would take one minute longer than current train services because the new line would serve Manchester airport.</p> <p>He said tunnelling under Manchester city centre to link conventional lines would be a better option, creating a network serving destinations east to Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield.</p> <p>Henri Murison, the chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said threats to scrap proposed links would hold back jobs, investment and productivity. He said: “The chancellor is on the brink of putting forward a plan to build a modern, reliable rail network that northern businesses and communities have been calling for. For Reform to propose scrapping this network before it’s even been properly set out shows how irresponsible they are.</p> <p>“They clearly expect they have northern voters in the bag, but the economic harm they would impose will worry those who care about their children and grandchildren’s future.”</p> <p>The NPR plan that Labour is expected to endorse would also revive part of the planned HS2 construction between Crewe and Manchester – raising the prospect, for both supporters and opponents of the high-speed rail scheme, that a future government might again extend HS2 from Birmingham and London to northern cities.</p> <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The north has been stuck with second-rate transport for too long, leaving communities cut off and holding back growth. The government is delivering the transport infrastructure needed for faster and more reliable journeys to create jobs and deliver stronger growth.</p> <p>“We will set out our ambitions for Northern Powerhouse Rail in the near future.”</p>",

Instead of getting the Jubilee line to Marylebone station, she took the bus which she said was “excruciatingly slow” and full of people. “The bus also terminated early at Finchley Road so I had to walk about 40 minutes from there,” said the 33-year-old.<br><br>Despite her journey taking longer than the usual 45 minutes, she supports those on strike.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Working 35 hours a week is a lot of time for anyone, especially those operating heavy machinery. I personally support moving to a four-day working week across society.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Marketing data planner, Kate, from Wraysbury</strong>, is one commuter who found her journey into work easier today. “The train was super quiet, even for a Monday,” said the 58-year-old. Travelling into Waterloo she felt the stations on the line that typically fill up with people were not as busy as they normally would be.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I feel for the people who have been affected. We have one day a month at work where everyone is supposed to be in the office but we’re not even a quarter full today.<br><br>I am pro-union as a rule but I don’t know a huge amount about the details behind the strikes apart from wanting a shorter working week. I suspect that though it may be a fair request, it may not be the right time for people in public services to be going on strike right now.</p> </blockquote> <p>For <strong>31-year-old Luke,* a scientist who cycles to work in central London</strong>, he said his morning commute was like the “wild west”. Normally taking 45-minutes from Finsbury Park to Warren Street, he is used to it being a “pretty relaxed affair” of back roads and cycle lanes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today the roads were full of aggressive drivers, queues of traffic on previously quiet streets, and frustrated pedestrians weaving in and out of stopped traffic.<br><br>It only took a little longer, but there was a lot more dicing with death than I’d have preferred. As a cyclist you often get to enjoy being traffic-proof, but that was certainly not the case this morning. It was like the hazard perception test times a hundred.</p> </blockquote> <p>He supports the strike but feels there is a way of “minimising the fallout” for other people trying to get to work.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I support the union, however, it is important to acknowledge that public support gets lower each time a strike makes an entire city grumpy.<br><br>We should tolerate the inconvenience of the strikes, but it also means that punishing the entire city with the strike is a misstep. RMT should encourage its members to keep services running without taking payment, properly targeting their industrial action to the people they want it to hit.</p> </blockquote> <p>*Name has been changed</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-08T15:29:16.448Z\">at 4.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68bee8388f0822f9101c06a7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-08T14:34:45.719Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Downing Street has urged the RMT union and Transport for London to get back to the negotiating table to end this week’s tube strikes, as it said Londoners were “fed up” with the disruption.</strong></p> <p>The strikes have brought almost the entire underground network in London to a halt and are due to run until 8am on Friday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/london-tube-strike-tfl-website-rmt\">London tube strike shuts down services, causing congestion on roads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our other main stories:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/mirror-publisher-jobs-ai-reach-express-star\">Mirror publisher puts 600 jobs at risk amid AI and reader changes</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/08/are-us-fashion-brands-at-risk-of-growing-anti-american-backlash-over-trump-policies\">Are US fashion brands at risk of growing anti-American backlash over Trump policies?</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/volkswagen-us-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-porsche\">Volkswagen ‘nearing US trade deal’ as it says Trump tariffs have cost it billions</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/08/george-osborne-robey-warshaw-takeover-evercore\">George Osborne ‘to miss out on big windfall’ from sale of investment bank</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/spurs-reject-two-takeover-approaches-club-not-for-sale-amanda-staveley\">Spurs say they have rejected two takeover approaches and club ‘not for sale’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Thank you for reading – we’ll be back tomorrow with the latest business and economic news.

Phoenix made an adjusted operating profit of £451m, up 25% from £360m a year earlier.</p> <p>However, total cash generation was down 17% to £784m, lower than expected.

Tesla once held more than 80% of the US market.</p> <p>Buyers are increasingly opting for other electric cars rather than Tesla’s ageing line-up, at a tough time for the industry. Analysts expect overall sales to drop in the coming months, as federal tax credits are due to expire at the end of September.</p> <p>While other automakers are rolling out new models, Tesla has turned its attention to building robotaxis and humanoid robots, and has delayed or ditched plans for cheaper new versions of its cars.</p> <p>Much of Tesla’s trillion-dollar valuation hangs on that bet. The company’s board on Friday proposed an unprecedented $1 trillion pay package for Musk that is partly dependent on the carmaker’s value rising to $8.5 trillion over the next decade. </p> <p>For now, Tesla’s core auto business generates most revenues. But its last new model introduced in 2023, the Cybertruck pickup, was not as popular as its Model 3 midsize sedan or Model Y midsize SUV.</p> <p>Tesla has tweaked the Model Y, once the world’s best-selling car, but the changes have not met expectations, and Tesla is on course for a second year of sales decline.</p> <p><strong>Stephanie Valdez Streaty</strong>, Cox’s director of industry insights, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know they’re positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you’re a car company, when you don’t have new products, your share will start to decline.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cox has more complete data for July, when Tesla’s market share fell to 42% from 48.7% in June. The drop was the sharpest since March 2021.</p>    <p>Musk’s political work as <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s ally has also damaged the Tesla brand. Musk helped the US president slash government jobs earlier this year, but left the administration in May and fell out with him publicly.</p> <p>For years, Tesla was able to increase sales rapidly and command a premium price for its vehicles, but has had to cut prices in recent years, squeezing its margins and worrying investors.<br><br>The July data showed rivals catching up. Carmakers <strong>Hyundai</strong>, <strong>Honda</strong>, <strong>Kia</strong> and <strong>Toyota</strong> rolled out higher incentives than Tesla and drove up EV sales between 60% and 120%, boosting their market share.</p> <p>Streaty said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they’re able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles - and it’s working.

The sudden resignation of Prime Minister <strong>Shigeru Ishiba</strong> over the weekend injected fresh uncertainty into Japanese markets, although the perception that his successor will be more fiscally expansive raises hope that we will see stocks benefit in response. </p> <p>With any successor likely to lean towards a pro-growth strategy, the possibility of additional spending kept the 30-year yield near record highs despite declines elsewhere. This is problematic for a nation with a 250% debt-to-GDP ratio. </p> <p>For the Bank of Japan, the change raises doubts over the pace of normalisation, with political instability potentially delaying a shift away from ultra-loose policy in a bid to keep yields anchored. The yen weakness we saw in response reflects capital outflow concerns and renewed uncertainty about Japan’s monetary and fiscal outlook.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turning to oil, where prices have risen by 2% today, Mahony said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the weekend, OPEC+ confirmed its latest production strategy, opting to raise October production by another 137k barrels per day (bpd). This stands in stark contrast to the pace seen in the months prior, with August and September announcements standing at 555k bpd. The question for many is whether there is any capacity left to enact these production increases, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE likely to be the only nations that have the ability to add any more into the market. With oil prices on the rise, this announcement looks to see the expansive period for OPEC+ drawing to a close.</p> <p>At the same time, global geopolitics have flared up once again, with Russia enacted its largest ever aerial attack on Ukraine that included strikes on the prime minister’s building in Kyiv. With <strong>Donald Trump</strong> warning of potential sanctions against Russia if the war persists, the pathway to peace remains far from simple. Unfortunately for the US, their previous sanctions have had little impact on Russian exports, with China and India showing a willingness to side with their BRICS partners rather than curb cheap Russian oil imports.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68bea2f38f0822f9101c0349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-09-08T09:39:26.773Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gold breaks through $3,600</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gold has broken through $3,600 an ounce, after weak US jobs data on Friday bolstered expectations of an interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve at its meeting next week.</p> <p>Spot gold gained 0.7% today to $3,611 an ounce.</p> <p>Lower interest rates weigh on the dollar, making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies.

Imports grew by 1.3%, down from a 4.1% rise in July.</p> <p>Beijing’s shipments to the US fell by 33% while exports to southeast Asian nations rose by 22.5%. Policymakers want manufacturers to shift to other markets in light of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s erratic trade policy.</p> <p>The US president delayed sweeping tariffs on China in mid-August, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the the world’s two largest economies was due to expire.</p> <p>Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%. However, Chinese imports are subject to a a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra levy in response to fentanyl smuggling <a href=\"https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/05/president-trump-announces-preliminary-trade-agreements-with-uk-china\">allegations</a> against China. Some products are taxed at higher rates.</p> <p>China’s trade surplus rose to $102.3bn in August from $98.2bn in July, but below June’s $114.8bn. Analysts are waiting to see whether officials will rollout extra fiscal support measures in the fourth quarter to revive domestic demand.</p> <p>Separately, <strong>Germany’s exports fell unexpectedly in July while industrial production rose.</strong></p> <p>Shipments from Europe’s biggest economy dropped by 0.6% from the previous month, against economists’ forecasts of a 0.1% gain. Imports were also down, by 0.1%. The country’s foreign trade surplus reduced to €14.7bn from €15.4bn in June, and compared with €17.7bn in July 2024.</p> <p>On a brighter note, German industrial production rose by 1.3% in July.</p> <p><strong>Oil prices climbed, recouping some of last week’s losses, after the oil cartel Opec and allies such as Russia, known as Opec+, agreed over the weekend to raise output at a slower pace from October on expectations of weaker global demand.</strong> The possibility of more sanctions on Russia, a major oil exporter, also rose after Moscow’s overnight strike on Ukraine.</p> <p>Brent crude rose by 1.5% to $66.45 a barrel.</p> <p>On Sunday, eight members of OPEC+ agreed to lift production from October by 137,000 barrels per day, far below the monthly increases of 555,000 bpd in September and August, and 411,000 bpd in July and June.</p> <p><strong>The Agenda</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>TUC Congress in Brighton</p></li> <li><p>4pm BST: US Consumer inflation expectations for August</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-09-08T06:54:43.302Z\">at 7.54am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "content": "<p> By the time Mark Dawson joined the Ship in Hampshire eight years ago, trade had thinned to a trickle. “We were busy when the sun shone,” said the general manager. “But otherwise, it was very quiet.”</p> <p>Over the next year, Dawson tried a range of ways to attract the local Langstone community. But footfall remained low. “Eventually I decided to go back in time: to themed nights,” he said. “I really went for it – and the success was immediate, lasting and is still growing.”</p> <p>The Ship is now bustling with locals not just keen to take part in its regular quiz nights, Tina Turner nights and Evenings with Elvis – but eager to bring their homemade crafts to the pub’s annual raft race from the local harbour – last year, more than 2,000 people attended – and its Punch and Judy events (“We ostensibly hold it for the kids but everyone comes,” said Dawson). He somehow had real tanks at the pub for VE Day and – his favourite – holds a Rocky Horror Time Warp dance every Halloween.</p> <p>“Theme nights used to be popular 20 years ago, then they dropped out of fashion,” he said. “But my experience is that they’re becoming wildly popular again, with younger customers discovering communal, themed silliness for the first time – and older customers rediscovering the joy from their youth.”</p>    <p>Dawson is not alone. Across the UK, pubs are throwing their doors open to themed events: opera under canvas, Shakespeare in garden marquees, film nights in tepees. Clay making, lampshade painting, pinot and Picasso, and floral design workshops now take place in venues once defined by beer mats and televised football.</p> <p>But it is not about novelty, say experts – it is about necessity. “Theme nights have become key to getting people out of their houses and into pubs and bars,” said Michael Kill, the chief executive officer of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA).</p> <p>Kill points to research from the NTIA’s latest Night Time Economy Market Monitor that found the number of themed bars and pubs increased by 5.6% in the second quarter of 2025 – and by 21.4% in the past 12 months.</p> <p>“We’re revisiting the successes of the past: going back to having fun and not taking ourselves too seriously,” he said. “Themed nights had gone in abeyance over the last few years: the last five years have really just been about keeping your head above water but we’re now seeing a resurgence. Themed nights are the one thing that’s bucking the trend and showing growth.”</p> <p>Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, agreed. “It’s a major revival,” she said. “Some themes are traditional – murder mysteries, quizzes – but people are also putting on really imaginative events. They’re trying to inspire people to think differently about the pub.”</p> <p>The crisis underpinning this creative revival is acute. Between January and June 2025, 209 pubs in England and Wales closed permanently – an average of eight a week. In April 2025 alone, 67 pubs entered administration.</p> <p>More than 20% of UK pubs – more than 8,100 venues – are technically insolvent. Of those, 4,604 are in what is described as the “maximum risk” category, up more than 500 from the previous year.</p> <p>Cathy Olver, the retail director at Star Pubs, said themed events were part of a survival strategy. “People still want to go out,” she said. “But now, you have to give them a reason.”</p> <p>Her team works with publicans across the country, supplying full toolkits – posters, social media templates, trophies – for themed nights including Elvis impersonator evenings. “Elvis is always a winner,” she said.</p> <p>Research conducted by Star Pubs suggests that while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/11/sixes-cricket-pushes-boundaries-of-competitive-socialising-the-spin\">competitive socialising</a> appeals strongly to younger people, only 25% of over-65s agree. “Theme nights bridge that gap,” Olver said. “They’re multi-generational.”</p> <p>Chris Bickle, a director at Savills’ licensed leisure department, said themed nights offered customers “something warm and familiar”. He said: “Life is complicated, judgmental. These nights offer a kind of comfort.”</p> <p>Bickle sees the industry’s strategy as one of inclusive curation. “Opera and Shakespeare might bring in an older audience. Murder mystery or live comedy could skew younger. You need to attract both.”</p> <p>The movement is driving innovation: some pubs offer early evening readings, open mic poetry, or wine-and-jazz nights designed to fit between school runs and last orders. “People want a richer experience,” said McClarkin. “It’s not just about the drink any more. Themed nights give people that sense of occasion, something to talk about, something to come back for.”</p> <p>And, crucially, something to keep the lights on. As margins shrink – publicans make on average 12p profit per pint – the need to offer more than alcohol is no longer optional, it is, for many, the only option left.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Nate Soares says case of US teenager Adam Raine highlights danger of unintended consequences in super-intelligent AI</p>",
    "content": "<p>The unforeseen impact of chatbots on mental health should be viewed as a warning over the existential threat posed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/10/ai-firms-urged-to-calculate-existential-threat-amid-fears-it-could-escape-human-control\">super-intelligent artificial intelligence systems</a>, according to a prominent voice in AI safety.</p> <p>Nate Soares, a co-author of a new book on highly advanced AI titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, said the example of Adam Raine, a US teenager who killed himself after months of conversations with the ChatGPT chatbot, underlined fundamental problems with controlling the technology.</p> <p>“These AIs, when they’re engaging with teenagers in this way that drives them to suicide – that is not a behaviour the creators wanted. That is not a behaviour the creators intended,” he said.</p> <p>He added: “Adam Raine’s case illustrates the seed of a problem that would grow catastrophic if these AIs grow smarter.”</p>    <p>Soares, a former Google and Microsoft engineer who is now president of the US-based Machine Intelligence Research Institute, warned that humanity would be wiped out if it created artificial super-intelligence (ASI), a theoretical state where an AI system is superior to humans at all intellectual tasks. Soares and his co-author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, are among the AI experts warning that such systems would not act in humanity’s interests.</p> <p>“The issue here is that AI companies try to make their AIs drive towards helpfulness and not causing harm,” said Soares. “They actually get AIs that are driven towards some stranger thing. And that should be seen as a warning about future super-intelligences that will do things nobody asked for and nobody meant.”</p> <p>In one scenario portrayed in Soares and Yudkowsky’s book, which will be published this month, an AI system called Sable spreads across the internet, manipulates humans, develops synthetic viruses and eventually becomes super-intelligent – and kills humanity as a side-effect while repurposing the planet to meet its aims.</p> <p>Some experts play down the potential threat of AI to humanity. Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and a senior figure in the field, has <a href=\"https://x.com/ylecun/status/1719475457265938604\">denied there is an existential threat</a> and said AI “could actually save humanity from extinction”.</p> <p>Soares said it was an “easy call” to state that tech companies would reach super-intelligence, but a “hard call” to say when.</p> <p>“We have a ton of uncertainty. I don’t think I could guarantee we have a year [before ASI is achieved]. I don’t think I would be shocked if we had 12 years,” he said.</p> <p>Zuckerberg, a major corporate investor in AI research, has said developing super-intelligence is now “in sight”.</p> <p>“These companies are racing for super-intelligence. That’s their reason for being,” said Soares.</p> <p>“The point is that there’s all these little differences between what you asked for and what you got, and people can’t keep it directly on target, and as an AI gets smarter, it being slightly off target becomes a bigger and bigger deal.”</p> <p>Soares said one policy solution to the threat of ASI was for governments to adopt a multilateral approach echoing the UN treaty on <a href=\"https://treaties.unoda.org/t/npt\">non-proliferation of nuclear weapons</a>.</p> <p>“What the world needs to make it here is a global de-escalation of the race towards super-intelligence, a global ban of … advancements towards super-intelligence,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/05/anthropic-settlement-ai-book-lawsuit\">AI startup Anthropic agrees to pay $1.5bn to settle book piracy lawsuit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month, Raine’s family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">launched legal action against the owner of ChatGPT, OpenAI</a>. Raine took his own life in April after what his family’s lawyer called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. OpenAI, which extended its “deepest sympathies” to Raine’s family, is now implementing guardrails around “sensitive content and risky behaviours” for under-18s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support\">Psychotherapists have also said</a> that vulnerable people turning to AI chatbots instead of professional therapists for help with their mental health could be “sliding into a dangerous abyss”. Professional warnings of the potential for harm include a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/cmy7n_v3\">preprint academic study</a> published in July, which reported that AI may amplify delusional or grandiose content in interactions with users vulnerable to psychosis.</p> <p>•<em> In the US, you can call or text the <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> on 988, chat on <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\">988lifeline.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">text HOME</a> to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

    "content": "<p>Your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel\">Doctors find drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks, 31 August</a>) is of great interest. It cites a study that proposes replacing aspirin, the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy for individuals at high risk of heart attacks and strokes, with clopidogrel. We must point out, however, that clopidogrel does not work uniformly across individuals. Although mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01562-4/abstract\">Lancet publication</a>, it was only lightly considered in the Guardian article.</p> <p>Clopidogrel is a prodrug. To work, it needs to be metabolised by a liver enzyme that varies in the population because of variations in the CYP2C19 gene. Most individuals have “normal” or “supra-normal” levels of the enzyme and clopidogrel works as expected. However, “intermediate metabolisers” activate clopidogrel less efficiently and “poor metabolisers” struggle to activate clopidogrel at all. For these people, clopidogrel may not provide enough protection against heart attacks or strokes.</p> <p>This issue is not academic: 20%-30% of white individuals in the UK are intermediate or poor metabolisers and in Asian populations this can be as high as <a href=\"https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/genotes/knowledge-hub/clopidogrel/#:~:text=About%2020%25%E2%80%9330%25%20of,60%25%20in%20East%20Asian%20populations.\">50%-60%</a>. Ignoring individual genetic differences may also have legal implications. In 2024, Hawaii won a <a href=\"https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/2024-23-state-awarded-more-than-900-million-against-major-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-of-plavix/\">landmark lawsuit against clopidogrel manufacturers</a> for failing to disclose the efficacy and safety profile of the drug considering that a large percentage of the Hawaiian population are intermediate or poor metabolisers.</p> <p>In summary, clopidogrel’s effectiveness is not universal and a “one-drug-fits-all” approach may expose patients to preventable harm. Individuals can be tested for genetic variation in the CYP2C19 gene, enabling a personalised approach. Patients with normal or supra-normal levels of the enzyme can be treated with clopidogrel as standard for the long term, while those with lower enzyme levels can continue with aspirin, the current standard. Such a personalised approach may even provide better outcomes than those reported in the Lancet paper.</p> <p><strong>Dr Ronnie Ramlogan</strong><em>,</em><strong> Dr Dimitri Gagliardi</strong><em>,</em><strong> </strong><strong>Dr Luigi Venetucci</strong><em>,</em><strong> </strong><strong>Dr Abisope Akintola</strong><strong> </strong><em>University of Manchester,</em><strong> </strong><strong>Dr Cinzia Dello Russo</strong>, <strong>Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed </strong><em>University of Liverpool</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    "content": "<p>My grandfather, Bob Cook, who has died aged 94, was a scientist and artist. He was a pioneer in equine veterinary medicine, who challenged horse-training tradition with research that suggested bits cause pain, suffocation and the behavioural problems they are meant to solve.</p> <p>A veterinary iconoclast who spent decades fighting to “unshackle the horse”, he proposed that bit-free riding could eliminate conflict behaviours while improving performance and rider safety – findings that may ultimately transform equestrian sport. His final article will be published in <a href=\"https://horsesandpeople.com.au/\">Horses and People</a> magazine.</p> <p>Born in Wolverhampton to Elsie (nee Little) and Francis Cook, a business manager, Bob went to Bromsgrove school, Worcestershire, and then the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in London. After gaining his doctorate from Cambridge University, he worked as a vet in Kenya in the late 1960s and Kuwait in the 90s. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum<strong> </strong>of Dubai<strong> </strong>and Queen Elizabeth II were among his clients.</p> <p>Veterinary medicine proved doubly rewarding, as he met Margaret (nee Bowen), who was the secretary of a veterinary practice where they both worked in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and they married in 1965. She had three sons from her first marriage.</p> <p>They moved to the US in 1978, where Bob helped to set up the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Tufts University, in Boston, Massachusetts, serving as associate dean, and later professor emeritus. The bitless bridle he developed, still used worldwide, supported his research, showing that removing pain makes better horses and better riders.</p> <p>Bob brought eloquence to scientific writing. His hundreds of publications stand out for their clear, engaging style. An accomplished painter and calligrapher, he approached every field of knowledge with the rigour of a scientist and the wonder of a scholar. He loved music, poetry, art and architecture. Shortly before he died, he described himself as “jubilant”.</p> <p>A swimmer, runner and yoga practitioner, he still cut a dash on the dancefloor into old age. </p> <p>A son, Nicholas, died in 2003 and Margaret died in 2018. Bob is survived by two sons, Peter and Robin, his grandchildren, William, Tim, Madeleine and me, and his brother Roger.</p>",

Earlier this year, a woman became the first in the UK to give birth after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/07/grace-davidson-first-uk-womb-transplant-birth#:~:text=Grace%20Davidson%2C%2036%2C%20who%20was,could%20ever%20have%20asked%20for%E2%80%9D.\">receiving a womb</a> donated by her sister.</p> <p>Around the world, demand for organ transplants outstrips supply. In Britain, the waiting list for life-saving organ transplants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/09/number-of-patients-in-uk-waiting-for-lifesaving-organ-transplant-at-record-high\">has never been higher</a>. With a limited supply, what organs exist go to those who stand to benefit the most – typically young and terminally ill people.</p> <p>But what if we had a plentiful supply of organs? Would it make sense to offer them to older people to keep them well? Motallebzadeh is sceptical. “Having an organ transplant is a massive operation and you’ve got to be robust enough physiologically to get through that,” he says. </p> <p>And that is not the only consideration, says Motallebzadeh. “The three main causes of death in transplant recipients are cancer, infection and cardiovascular disease. And many of the anti-rejection therapies have side-effects that lead to this.”</p> <p>In short, having multiple rounds of surgery and continual doses of powerful anti-rejection drugs, which raise the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and lethal infections, could reduce lifespan rather than extend it.</p> <p>Major efforts are afoot to solve the organ shortage problem. One route involves using organs from pigs. The procedure, xenotransplantation, remains experimental but doctors in New York have performed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/16/pig-kidney-human-transplant\">pig kidney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/25/surgeons-transplant-pig-lung-into-brain-dead-human-recipient-for-first-time\">pig lung</a> transplants into brain-dead people to see how they fare.</p> <p>In the past year, two living patients have received genetically modified pig kidneys. The edits removed harmful pig genes, inactivated viruses lurking in the pig genome that could reawaken and cause infections and, crucially, added human genes to make them more compatible.</p> <p>The organs were supplied by eGenesis, a biotech company co-founded by the Harvard University geneticist George Church. He said both patients were “healthy and happy” and not on kidney dialysis any more.</p> <p>The company has approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a clinical trial in 33 patients. “If those 33 do as well as the first two, then it’ll be scaled up for the whole population,” Church said. “The number of pigs we would have to make is a tiny fraction of the number consumed each year for bacon and pork chops.”</p> <p>For now, the company is focusing on kidneys, liver and heart, but Church anticipates providing every organ and tissue that is normally transplanted from human to human.</p> <p>Farming pigs for organs is a practice that will have its critics, but far more radical and ethically fraught proposals are on the table. Earlier this year, researchers said advances in stem cell biology and artificial womb technology could enable scientists to create <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/publications/ethically-sourced-spare-human-bodies-could-revolutionize-medicine/\">spare human bodies</a>.</p> <p>The process is convoluted, but involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/04/work-on-synthetic-human-embryos-to-get-code-of-practice-in-uk\">making an embryo</a> from a patient’s cells, disabling genes needed for it to form a brain, and growing it in an artificial womb. The result is a brainless human body, made to supply organs to its genetic parent.</p> <p>“There’s an ick factor,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. “For a lot of people, an arm’s fine, a liver’s fine and a kidney’s fine. But when you have everything except a brain, it feels more human-like and people worry.”</p> <p>Church has high hopes for another approach. The liver and other organs could be genetically modified, in or out of the body, to be resistant to infection and release anti-ageing compounds such as proteins that help the body maintain good health. “You’re turning the organ into an anti-ageing therapy,” he says. If done in situ, it avoids the need for major surgery, risky anti-rejection medicines and headless humans.</p> <p>So might people born this century live to 150? “Probably somebody reading your article is going to be the last person to not have the option of living to 150,” Church says. “It would be sad to be the person who just misses the cut, and I have the feeling I’m one of those people.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Five areas of focus at world’s largest heart conference said to mark ‘turning point’ in cardiology and patient care</p>",
    "content": "<p>Doctors, scientists and researchers have shared new findings on ways to tackle heart conditions at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology annual meeting, the world’s largest heart conference.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress\">The event in Madrid</a> was attended by 33,000 health professionals from 169 countries. More than 1,100 sessions featured “gamechanger” research, new guidelines and groundbreaking trials.</p> <p>“This year’s ESC congress marks a turning point: cardiology has never been more dynamic, interdisciplinary, and patient-centred,” said Prof Felix Mahfoud, chair of the ESC communications committee.</p> <p>“Never before have we seen such a high number of late-breaking trials from across all fields of cardiology presented and simultaneously published in top journals, informing clinical decision-making and improving patient care.”</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the key takeaways.</p>  <h2>Medicine</h2>  <p>Doctors in Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/drug-baxdrostat-gamechanger-high-blood-pressure-hypertension\">hailed a new pill</a> for patients with high blood pressure resistant to existing medication as a “gamechanger” and a “triumph of science”.</p> <p>Globally, 1.3 billion people have hypertension and in half of cases, their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments. They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.</p> <p>A new drug – baxdrostat – can significantly lower blood pressure in these people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.</p> <p>The results of the BaxHTN study showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than the placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.</p> <p>There were also exciting discoveries about existing drugs that could help heart patients, delegates were told.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel\">In one trial</a>, researchers found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes. A new analysis of seven clinical trials showed patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared with those taking aspirin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/weight-loss-drugs-can-halve-heart-patients-risk-of-early-death-study-finds\">A second study showed</a> weight loss drugs may halve the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early.</p> <h2>Diet and exercise</h2>  <p>Eating foods rich in potassium, such as avocados, bananas and spinach, could reduce your risk of heart conditions, hospitalisation and death by 24%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/potassium-rich-diet-may-cut-risk-of-heart-failure-by-24-per-cent-study\">Danish researchers told the conference</a>.</p> <p>Previous research had shown that cutting out salt from meals can slash your risk of heart problems. A new study showed just how much potassium, which increases the amount of salt your body removes from the bloodstream, could help to ward off cardiovascular problems.</p> <p>Not a fan of spinach? Pulses, fish, nuts and seeds are also good sources of potassium, experts said.</p> <p>Exercise is also key to a healthy heart. It can lower your resting blood pressure and heart rate, improve your cholesterol levels, and help you maintain a healthy weight, which in turn reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>In Madrid, doctors heard about another potential benefit of getting active: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\">mending a broken heart</a>.</p> <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>  <p>Doctors have developed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/30/doctors-ai-stethoscope-heart-disease-london\">an artificial intelligence-led stethoscope</a> that can detect three heart conditions in 15 seconds.</p> <p>Two centuries after the invention of the humble stethoscope, a team at Imperial College London and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust have designed a hi-tech upgrade. It analyses tiny differences in heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and takes a rapid ECG at the same time.</p> <p>The tool’s AI capabilities mean it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly.</p> <p>Early diagnosis of these three heart conditions is critical. The AI stethoscope enables patients who need life-saving treatment to be spotted sooner, before they become dangerously unwell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a revolutionary AI scanning system is increasing the number of stroke patients avoiding serious disability, tripling the rate of recovery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/stroke-centres-in-england-given-ai-tool-that-will-help-50-of-patients-recover\">delegates were told</a>.</p> <p>And a new generative AI tool – ESC Chat – is <a href=\"https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress/Congress-news/ai-innovations-in-cardiology-navigating-the-path-to-wider-integration\">transforming the work</a> of cardiologists worldwide. The chatbot responds immediately to questions about clinical guidelines, saving time and providing doctors with access to recommendations, diagnostic criteria and treatment solutions.</p> <h2>Children</h2>  <p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), which is typically genetic, is responsible for more than 10% of sudden cardiac deaths in children.</p> <p>Now a simple cheek-swab test can identify children with the condition, five years before they would normally be diagnosed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/cheek-swab-test-children-heart-condition-arrhythmogenic-cardiomyopathy-acm-study\">according to research presented in Madrid</a>.</p> <p>Experts at Great Ormond Street hospital and City St George’s, University of London are now developing the two-minute test into swab kits that can be used at home and sent away for analysis.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors\">doctors raised the alarm</a> about high levels of vaping among children, saying they were convinced e-cigarettes were causing irreversible harm to their health.</p> <p>Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.</p> <h2>Vaccines</h2>  <p>Vaccination has increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.</p> <p>Delegates at the conference were briefed about the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis of the shingles vaccine. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/28/shingles-vaccine-heart-cardiovascular-medical-research\">The results showed</a> the jab could lower risk of a heart attack or stroke by as much as 18%.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A rare total lunar eclipse “blood moon” will be visible from the UK on Sunday night for the first time since 2022.</p> <p>The moon is expected to turn a deep, dark red as the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface.</p> <p>According to the Met Office, the moon will take on a reddish hue because it will be illuminated by light that has passed through the Earth’s atmosphere and has been bent back towards the moon by refraction, scattering blue light and allowing red wavelengths to reach the moon.</p> <p>Where skies are clear, the eclipse will be visible at about 7.30pm on Sunday. The Met Office recommends people keen to see the phenomenon plan to be somewhere with as clear a view of the eastern horizon as possible, ready for the lunar eclipse to peak in the UK at 7.33pm. In built-up areas this may mean going to a hill or viewpoint.</p> <p>The eclipse – sometimes referred to as a “blood moon” – will be visible to the naked eye and unlike solar eclipses is safe to view directly as the moon’s reflected light is not as bright.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/23/giant-asteroid-could-crash-moon-2032-firing-debris-earth\">Giant asteroid could crash into moon in 2032, firing debris towards Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Ed Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said the moon will rise over the UK just in time for people to see the tail end of the eclipse. He said: “The moon is pretty unmistakable in the sky, so the most important thing is to face the right direction.</p> <p>“It’ll be rising towards the east, and head southwards over the course of the night. As it rises, the most important thing will be whatever is low on your horizon. A flat landscape, or an elevated position makes for the best visibility – so there aren’t things like buildings, trees, or other things in the way.</p> <p>“A lunar eclipse like this is a great opportunity for observing with kids too. It isn’t too late for us in the UK, the target is nice and easy, and minute by minute you will notice changes – good for short attention spans.”</p> <p>People eager to see the eclipse are advised to check the forecast in their area over the weekend, but the Met Office said the clearest skies for viewing the blood moon are most likely to be across the south-west and parts of eastern England.</p> <p>The Royal Observatory said the next partial lunar eclipse will be in August 2026. Other regions well positioned to view the eclipse include Australia, China, India, the Philippines and parts of Africa.</p> <p>But most of North and South America will miss out entirely as they will be on the sunlit side of the planet during the event.<br><br>Throughout history, blood moons have stirred awe and superstition. Ancient cultures from Norse to South American, Native American to Chinese, interpreted the red moon as a sign of divine anger or supernatural conflict, while biblical texts warned that “the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible day”.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Elon Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire if he hits targets set by Tesla, under a scheme disclosed by the electric car company he runs and in which he is the largest shareholder.</p> \n<p>Tesla outlined the terms of the incentive package, unprecedented in corporate history, in a section of its latest stock market update that began: “Yes, you read that correctly.”</p> \n<p>Musk, the company said, will have to increase the value of Tesla from just over $1tn now to $8.5tn over 10 years.</p> \n<p>If he presides over growth on that scale, the 54-year-old will receive new shares that would push his stake in the company from nearly 16% to well beyond 25%, increasing the fortunes of the world’s richest man to more than $2tn.</p> \n<p>Estimates of Musk’s current net worth vary but a live ranking of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#42728253d788\">wealthiest people</a> on the planet, compiled by Forbes, estimates the South African-born tycoon’s fortune at $430.9bn. In second place, with $272.3bn, is the investor and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.</p> \n<p>The incentive plan, revealed in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a.htm\">filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> on Friday, comes at a time when some observers have questioned whether Musk’s outspoken political views could be holding Tesla back.</p> \n<p>The carmaker’s European sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/tesla-european-sales-elon-musk-electric-carmaker\">fell by 40% earlier this year</a>, a dramatic slump that some analysts attributed to Musk’s vocal support for far-right political parties, and his intense but short-lived alliance with Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Musk has also divided his duties between Tesla and the stewardship of other ventures, such as SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Co, on top of the time he spends posting on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which he bought for $44bn in 2022.</p> \n<p>“One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at the London-based stockbroker AJ Bell.</p> \n<p>He said the pay package “beggars belief”, questioning whether one person could be worth that much.</p> \n<p>But in its statement to shareholders, signed by directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Tesla offered Musk an outspoken vote of confidence, describing him as its “visionary leader”.</p> \n<p>The company also referred investors, a majority of whom must support the pay deal for it to go through, to the difficulty it has previously had in securing incentives for Musk.</p> \n<p>The filing referred to a legal challenge that has prevented it from following through on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/21/elon-musk-tesla-bonus-pay\">pay deal announced in 2018</a> that gave Musk the chance to claim a $55.8bn bonus.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-too-much-judge-rules#:~:text=A%20Delaware%20judge%20has%20ruled,and%20struck%20down%20the%20package.\">court ruled last year</a> in favour of a group of investors who claimed that the scheme’s targets had been inappropriately set. An appeal by Tesla is due to be heard next month.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately, the new award aims to build upon the success of the 2018 CEO performance award framework, which ensured that Elon was only paid for performance delivered and incentivised to guide Tesla through a period of meteoric growth,” the company said.</p> \n<p>Tesla said the new plan included profit targets that were 28 times higher than the 2018 scheme and would also hinge on delivering new products, such as getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/24/tesla-robotaxi-investigation-us\">1m “robotaxis” in operation</a> and delivering 1m AI bots, humanoid robots that the company is developing.</p> \n<p>If Musk fails to double Tesla’s valuation over the 10-year period, he will receive no pay award.</p> \n<p>In an apparent justification of Musk’s proposed pay package, Tesla said: “If Elon achieves all the performance milestones […] his leadership will propel Tesla to become the most valuable company in history.”</p> \n<p>Tesla said it “believes that Mr Musk’s vision and leadership are critical to nailing that execution”.</p> \n<p>The target stock market value of $8.5tn is more than double the current value of Nvidia, the chipmaker that is currently the world’s most valuable company.</p> \n<p>“Tesla is a public company, and shareholders will ultimately decide if he deserves a $1tn pay deal,” Coatsworth said.</p> \n<p>“Securing this money will be dependent on hitting targets, and current progress suggests Musk will need a stroke of extraordinarily good luck to grab the 13-digit figure.</p> \n<p>“Shareholders would love for Musk to hit the targets to trigger the payday, as they would also share in the success via a higher share price. Therefore, it feels like many investors would happily approve it.</p> \n<p>“The bigger question is whether this proposal sets a new precedent and boardrooms across America will think it’s OK to add a zero or two on to the end of current remuneration packages. It all seems a tad excessive and a symptom of poor corporate governance.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"88dfb1a6-0102-4125-87db-891e1f543c09\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Tesla CEO’s absence is marked departure from his constant presence at the White House in early days of Trump 2.0</p>",
    "content": "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> hosted leaders from the biggest US tech companies at a lavish White House state dining room dinner on Thursday night, there was one notable absence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, once inseparable from Trump and a constant, contentious presence in the White House, was not in attendance.</p> <p>The dinner, which included Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Apple’s Tim Cook and OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sam-altman\">Sam Altman</a>, was exactly the type of event where Musk would have sat at Trump’s right hand only a few months ago. Instead, the Tesla CEO stated on his social media platform X that he had been invited but could not make it. He said he planned to send a representative and spent the day on X posting a familiar stream of attacks on immigration and trans people.</p> <p>The White House did not respond for comment on why Musk would not be at the dinner.</p> <p>The event, which was to have been held on the newly paved-over Rose Garden, until a forecast of thunderstorms forced the event indoors, began with televised words of praise for the president from several of the assembled tech leaders, and a brief series of questions from reporters.</p> <p>Musk’s absence, even if voluntary, is a stark turnaround from when Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-trump-donald-mar-a-lago-appointment-position-rcna179826\">repeatedly joked</a> following the election that “Elon won’t go home, I can’t get rid of him”. The vacant seat highlights a divide that has emerged between the two men since their very public falling out earlier this year, one that has seen Musk’s influence over the government wane despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars to re-elect Trump during the 2024 election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/aug/28/elon-musk-antonio-gracias-mdma-psychedelics-company\">How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Musk’s omission from the list of attendees also echoes one of the seminal moments of his political evolution, another White House event. In 2022, then president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/business/dealbook/biden-musk-apple.html\">failed to invite the Tesla CEO to a summit on electric vehicles</a> over concerns it would draw backlash from autoworkers’ unions. Musk, who had not yet publicly aligned himself with the Republican party, lashed out at the White House for the snub and declared that he would not vote for Biden. The move proved enormously costly for Democrats.</p> <p>The incident clearly stuck with Musk, who like Trump has shown a tendency to harbor long-term grudges. Even on the day of Trump’s dinner, he reserved his ire for Biden rather than the current president, retweeting a clip of himself from 2023 addressing Biden’s snub with the post “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them”.</p> <p>In the ensuing years, Musk has taken a hard turn to the political right. He has turned X into a bastion of far-right influencers, whom he frequently retweets to his more than 200 million followers. He has promoted false theories about Democrats conspiring to get immigrants to illegally vote en masse and embraced far-right political parties around the world. He also became Trump’s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporter, contributing nearly $300m to the re-election campaign and Republican causes.</p> <p>Musk’s support for Trump placed him in a position of immense power after the president’s inauguration as the tech mogul established and led the so-called “department of government efficiency” and its sweeping dismantling of federal agencies. It also turned him into a prominent guest at political dinners and events, only a year after the British government did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/26/elon-musk-uk-government-invite-tech-summit\">not invite him to a major tech summit</a> as he made inflammatory anti-immigrant posts that claimed a “civil war” would take place in the UK.</p> <p>Since Musk and Trump’s relationship imploded in May over policy differences – Musk railed against Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill – which then snowballed into Musk accusing Trump of being in the files pertaining to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the xAI CEO has all but vanished from high-profile government events. Although Trump still praises Musk as a “genius”, he told reporters on Wednesday night that Musk has “got some problems” and the two have not been seen together since their public spat.</p> <p>As Musk has feuded with Trump and ceded his place in the White House, however, rival tech moguls have grown closer with the administration and filled some of the vacuum. Earlier this month, Trump hosted Cook, the Apple CEO, at the White House, who in turn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/06/trump-apple-us-manufacturing-investment\">gifted the president a 24-karat-gold</a> souvenir. Meanwhile, Trump aides have discussed cutting Musk’s government contracts, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/trump-aides-discussed-ending-some-spacex-contracts-but-found-most-were-vital-d1cf9ab5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhpvqtudLrsdqwwNmlQ0OLQveFSrvc9g6fLOZDZg4VCboKtYFSNFFQxauxPnUE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b9e260&amp;gaa_sig=LoRspi53pxIleYjGewyqJPeh7maxo1Y6kJXNfkrKCUmHAzNNqDlNSigU3i_o8pWkedMCXKsucZDCmevKfRyAEQ%3D%3D\">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, only to find upon review that doing so would endanger too many key operations.</p> <p>If Musk had attended Thursday’s dinner, it would have created an awkward arrangement as he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/25/musk-xai-lawsuit-open-ai-apple\">suing two of the companies whose leaders were in attendance</a>: Apple and OpenAI, helmed by his former collaborator and now nemesis Altman. As with Trump, Musk has also attacked Gates for his ties to Epstein after the Microsoft founder <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/bill-gates-elon-musk-killing-children.html\">accused him of “killing children”</a> through Doge’s cuts to foreign aid.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Entrepreneur who overcame the odds to realise his vision of a spaceport in Shetland</p>",
    "content": "<p>The serial entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czerw98njk6o\">Frank Strang, who has died aged 67 of oesophageal cancer</a>, seized an unpremeditated opportunity to deliver the first licensed spaceport for vertical launches in western Europe, overcoming multiple barriers along the way.</p> <p>Having acquired a disused RAF radar station base at the most northerly point in the Shetland Islands a decade earlier – without any thought of spaceports – by 2017 Strang had realised the potential of his asset as the government sought to promote a UK launch capacity.</p> <p>Long-haired and cowboy-booted, Strang weaved his way through the corridors of power to persuade government, regulators and private investors that the answer lay in the former Saxa Vord base on the island of Unst. Step by step, he and his small team overcame safety, planning and political challenges while walking a financial tightrope to keep the vision alive.</p> <p>One of the more unlikely delays came from Historic Environment Scotland on grounds that the launch site would mean demolition of RAF Skaw, a second world war radar station that had been designated “a monument of national significance”. The quango eventually withdrew its objection, recognising the spaceport’s national importance.</p> <p>SaxaVord Spaceport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/17/shetland-islands-remote-location-is-giving-uk-space-industry-a-boost\">was licensed in 2023</a> by the Civil Aviation Authority and the first launch is due within the coming months, with international clients from both civil and military sectors signed up. </p>    <p>It is poignant that Strang will not be around to witness the climax to his endeavours; his cancer diagnosis came just two months before his death.</p> <p>The Saxa Vord RAF base had closed in 2006 and was bought shortly afterwards by Frank and his then wife, Debbie. The site included 23 houses and became an eco-tourism centre with accommodation, restaurant and bar. They diversified into a facilities company, providing up to 2,000 oil workers at the Sullom Voe terminal on the Shetland mainland with accommodation and catering, and founded the <a href=\"https://www.northlinkferries.co.uk/shetland-blog/shetland-reel-gin/#:~:text=Shetland%20Distillery%20Company%20have%20been,in%20creating%20a%20top%20product!\">UK’s most northerly gin distillery, on Unst, in 2014</a>.</p> <p>The lightbulb moment came when the UK government commissioned the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/14/satellites-could-be-launched-from-shetland-islands-most-nothern-isle\">Sceptre report to advise on potential for establishing a vertical launch site in the north of Scotland</a>. It <a href=\"https://www.hie.co.uk/media/6626/sceptre-final-report-february-2017.pdf\">concluded</a> that “the Shetland Isles has the best orbital access, but the remote site means it is logistically the most challenging”.</p> <p>The Strangs, along with a former RAF fighter pilot, Scott Hammond, in 2017 founded Shetland Space Centre (of which I later became a director); it was renamed <a href=\"https://saxavord.com/\">SaxaVord Spaceport</a> in 2021. The challenges, as well as the remote location, also included the fact that the Scottish government put its weight and money behind a virgin site on the Sutherland mainland, close to land owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, a Danish businessman who has extensive interests in the north of Scotland.</p> <p>Povlsen’s well-founded environmental objections to the Sutherland option developed into wholehearted enthusiasm for SaxaVord and, as the need for investment grew to fund its construction, his sustained support and faith in Strang’s ability to deliver kept the show on the road.</p> <p>“Against the odds,” <a href=\"https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2025/08/14/space-pioneers-widow-says-death-has-left-a-void-in-the-world-that-can-never-be-filled\">said Povlsen</a>, “and with many headwinds, even a few unfair ones, he built the solid foundations of what will likely become Europe’s largest commercial spaceport. No matter what happens, many people, including me, are going to stay right behind Frank, doing our utmost to make sure SaxaVord becomes the success it’s set up for.”</p> <p>Hammond, who has succeeded Frank as chief executive, said: “We are determined to make the UK Europe’s leader in vertical launch spaceflight. That will be Frank’s legacy for Shetland, for Scotland and the UK.”</p> <p>Frank was born and spent his early years in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where his father, Tom, was a physical education teacher. His mother, Barbara, also a teacher, died when he was 13. The family had its roots in the Highlands, and Frank completed his schooling at Dingwall academy, Ross-shire. He then graduated in PE from Jordanhill College of Education, Glasgow.</p> <p>After a spell teaching, he was accepted for training at the RAF College Cranwell, and joined the service as a physical education officer latterly based at Lossiemouth, in Moray, where he met Debbie Hope, a fellow RAF officer; they married in 1991. Part of Frank’s role lay in community relations, and in 1994, the year of his departure from the RAF, he was appointed MBE for charitable fundraising. He was also coach to the Scottish freestyle ski team for five years.</p> <p>He left the service after suffering an injury in a parachuting accident. His first business venture was to promote the US region of New England as a winter sports destination for UK skiers.</p> <p>This took Frank into a project to redevelop a former military airport near Boston, which opened his eyes to similar possibilities in the UK, as the Ministry of Defence disposed of property assets. These were pursued with mixed results but his most fateful decision proved to be the purchase of Saxa Vord.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.shetland.gov.uk/\">Shetland Islands council </a>chief executive Maggie Sandison, who was involved from the outset, noted that the project was conceived and constructed with the community in mind: “Frank’s commitment to a spaceport education strategy created opportunities for children and young people to engage with astronauts, attend space camps and participate in national space competitions.”</p> <p>Frank and Debbie, who is deputy chief executive of Shetland Space Centre, separated two years ago.</p> <p>Recently, he married Dani Morey. She survives him, along with Tom and Emily, the children of his first marriage.</p> <p>• Frank Strang, entrepreneur, born 3 August 1958; died 13 August 2025</p> <p>• This article was amended on 5 September 2025. The text and main picture caption of an earlier version suggested that the spaceport was built on the site of the RAF Saxa Vord base, when in fact the launch site itself is on land previously occupied by the second world war radar station RAF Skaw.</p>",

It tested out facial age estimation, age verification using IDs, parental controls, parental consent, age inference and other methods including verification on the phone operating system level.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> \n<p>ACCS said in the report it was not the role of the trial to recommend a specific type of technology or whether age assurance should be used at all.</p> \n<p>It conducted 28,514 facial age estimation tests with 13 vendors across Australia and found most tests took less than 40 seconds to complete.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/19/australia-age-assurance-trial-social-media-ban-leaks-resignations\">Key stakeholders in Australia’s social media age assurance trial frozen out amid media leaks and resignations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a “fundamental misunderstanding” of age estimating technology that it could be used without a “margin of error”, the report said: “False negatives will then be inevitable and alternative methods will be required to correct them.”</p> \n<p>The report found there is a two- to three-year “buffer zone” for facial age estimation where it is likely that errors in correctly estimating a person’s age will increase, for example if a user is 17 and it estimates them to be under 16, or a 14-year-old told they are over 16.</p> \n<p>The report said these users would probably need to be referred for age verification as a fallback method.</p> \n<p>“The implementation of buffer thresholds also plays a crucial role in enabling successive validation, a layered approach to age assurance where one method (e.g. age estimation) is followed by a second, more definitive method (e.g. document-based verification) when uncertainty is high,” the report said.</p> \n<p>For people aged 16 and 17, false rejection rates remained “above acceptable levels” for facial age estimation, the report found, at 8.5% and 2.6% respectively.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cd513594-5100-4691-87ad-00f5fb6f69fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J_kAvjjdhV0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another major issue identified was that there were accuracy issues for older adults, non-Caucasian users and female-presenting people near the age levels tested, as well as underrepresentation of Indigenous people in the training data.</p> \n<p>“Skin tone is a known source of bias in age estimation systems,” the report said.</p> \n<p>“As light reflects off a subject’s face and into the camera sensor, lighter skin tones tend to return more detail-rich signals because they reflect more light; darker skin absorbs more light, reducing contrast and lower data availability for the algorithm to analyse.”</p> \n<p>The report noted that both Meta and Snapchat already use facial age estimation technology.</p> \n<p>Snapchat later said the report was incorrect that the company does not use facial age estimation on its platform.</p> \n<p>Other biometric tests, including hand gestures and voice analysis, were said to be “promising” but still not yet developed enough for wide deployment.</p> \n<p>Under the law, providers can use age verification via ID checks as one method but it cannot be the only method offered.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/01/how-australia-under-16s-social-media-ban-enforced-tiktok-instagram-facebook-exempt-platforms\">How will Australia’s under-16s social media ban be enforced, and which platforms will be exempt?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The report also found while most age verification providers kept as little data as possible, there was “concerning evidence” that, without guidance, some providers were “over-anticipating the eventual needs of regulators about providing personal information for future investigations” and were building tools to enable regulators or law enforcement to retrace actions of people to verify their age, which the report said could lead to increased risk of privacy breaches.</p> \n<p>Age inference – where a platform estimates a user’s age based on behaviour of the account, interests, friends and other data – was found to be useful to flag likely underage access and support interventions or trigger fallback mechanisms such as age estimation, and is more “low friction” for users who are over the age restriction.</p> \n<p>Circumvention using AI and faked images were also something vendors said they had tools to combat, such as using live motion tracking in facial age estimation.</p> \n<p>Some vendors highlighted their software could be used to detect if users were using virtual private network connections to dodge the age restriction requirements in Australia. The report found that while it was “promising, this approach raises its own challenges related to accuracy, evasion tactics and the implications for user privacy and cross-border service access”.</p> \n<p>Wells said there was no “one size fits all” solution to age assurance. “This trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded.”</p> \n<p>The federal government was “pushing forward with our mission to keep kids safer online through world-leading reforms”.<br></p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 5 September 2025 to note that Snapchat does not use facial age estimation technology, as claimed in the age assurance technology trial report.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer \"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;><script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

    "content": "<p>Set your alarm, pray for clear skies and prepare to be awestruck in the early hours of Monday morning, when Australia becomes the prime location to witness a rare total lunar eclipse.</p> <p>A blood moon, as it is called, occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. The moon takes on a deep red hue, giving it a surreal, even eerie, appearance.</p> <h2>What time is the blood moon in Australia?</h2> <p>About 2.27am AEST on Monday, the moon will begin to enter Earth’s shadow. By 3.30am it will be fully immersed in the darkest part, glowing a deep, burnished red. This phase, known as totality, will last until 4.42am, offering more than 70 minutes of surreal lunar beauty. The eclipse will conclude at 5.56am.</p> <h2>Where can you see the blood moon?</h2> <p>West Australians should be able to enjoy particularly striking views, according to Laura Driessen, an astronomer at the University of Sydney, with the moon high overhead. In the eastern states the moon will be low on the western horizon, which may create the illusion that it’s larger than usual. For viewers in Perth, the eclipse begins at 12.27am local time and will wrap up by 2.57am.</p> <p>“We get lunar eclipses once every couple of years, but they don’t always line up for Australia,” Driessen says.</p> <p>“This one is really special because the whole country gets to see the best parts – when the moon enters the darkest part of Earth’s shadow and turns red.</p> <p>“You don’t need any special equipment to see it, and you don’t even need to be in a particularly dark place. As long as the skies are clear, you’ll be able to see it anywhere in Australia.”</p> <p>Dr Tanya Hill, senior curator of astronomy at Museums Victoria, describes how the shadow slowly creeps across the moon until it’s fully engulfed in crimson light.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/no-telescope-needed-how-to-navigate-the-australian-night-sky-in-summer\">No telescope needed: how to navigate the Australian night sky in summer | Virginia Kilborn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“From Earth we’ll see the shadow slowly move across the face of the moon, until the moon is fully engulfed and turns a deep red.”</p> <p>This eclipse is particularly favourable for Australia because the country sits perfectly on the night side of Earth during the alignment. Although another is expected next year, Driessen believes Australians won’t see another one quite as spectacular as the one predicted on Monday until 2028.</p> <p>This one, she says, is definitely worth waking up for.</p> <p>Other regions well positioned to view the eclipse include China, India, the Philippines and parts of Africa. But most of North and South America will miss out entirely, as they will be on the sunlit side of the planet during the event.</p> <p>Throughout history, blood moons have stirred awe and superstition. Ancient cultures from Norse to South American, Native American to Chinese, interpreted the red moon as a sign of divine anger or supernatural conflict. Some ancient cultures believed the moon was under attack by malevolent forces. Even biblical texts warned that “the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible day”.</p> <p>Science may have demystified the phenomenon, but the visual spectacle promises to be just as powerful – and just a little bit poetic.</p> <p>For more information on the science behind the blood moon, go to <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2025-september-7\">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2025-september-7</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Jean Innes says it is time for ‘new chapter’ at AI research body, after staff revolt and government calls for change</p>",
    "content": "<p>The chief executive of the UK’s leading artificial intelligence institute is stepping down after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/shut-it-down-and-start-again-staff-disquiet-as-alan-turing-institute-faces-identity-crisis\">staff revolt</a> and government calls for a strategic overhaul.</p> \n<p>Jean Innes has led the Alan Turing Institute since 2023, but her position has come under pressure amid widespread discontent within the organisation and a demand from its biggest funder, the UK government, for a change in direction.</p> \n<p>ATI said the search was already under way for a replacement for Innes, who held senior roles in the civil service and technology industry before her appointment.</p> \n<p>Government sources pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/04/minister-demands-overhaul-of-uks-leading-ai-institute-alan-turing\">letter sent by the technology secretary</a>, Peter Kyle, to ATI’s chair in July that demanded strategic change and indicated a need for new leadership.</p> \n<p>In the letter, Kyle said the institute should switch its focus to defence and national security and urged “careful consideration” on having an appropriate executive team in place for such a move.</p> \n<p>Innes said on Thursday: “It has been a great honour to lead the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, implementing a new strategy and overseeing significant organisational transformation. With that work concluding, and a new chapter starting for the institute, now is the right time for new leadership and I am excited about what it will achieve.”</p> \n<p>One source familiar with the internal debate at ATI said Innes’s departure indicated that Kyle’s letter had been taken seriously. However, the source added that changes at board level would be needed as well if ATI was to focus fully on defence and national security. The reply letter to Kyle from the ATI chair, Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, said it would focus on defence and national security but would still work on environment and health.</p> \n<p>An ATI staff member, who said they had consulted on a range of concerns held by colleagues, said the resignation of Innes indicated governance at the institute was not working and that its leadership “needed to be held to account”. Many employees still want the institute to address “societal challenges” as well as focus on defence and security, said the staff member.</p> \n<p>Gurr thanked Innes, who will remain in her post until later this year, for focusing on “delivering real-world impact in priority areas for the UK”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/shut-it-down-and-start-again-staff-disquiet-as-alan-turing-institute-faces-identity-crisis\">‘Shut it down and start again’: staff disquiet as Alan Turing Institute faces identity crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>ATI has been beset by internal strife since last year as staff protested against changes, culminating in a group of employees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/staff-alan-turing-institute-ai-complain-watchdog\">filing a whistleblower complaint</a> to the Charity Commission last month. Citing references to funding in Kyle’s letter, they said they feared £100m of government backing may be withdrawn, which “could lead to the institute’s collapse”.

    "title": "‘Slap on the wrist’: critics decry weak penalties on Google after landmark monopoly trial",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/03/google-monopoly-case-ruling",
    "description": "<p>Judge said tech giant had monopoly but let it keep Chrome and Android; critics cried foul while Wall Street cheered</p>",
    "content": "<p>A judge ruled on Tuesday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> would not be forced to sell its Chrome browser or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android\">Android</a> operating system, saving the tech giant from the most severe penalties sought by the US government. The same judge had ruled in favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.</p> <p>Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet\">internet</a> search and online <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising\">advertising</a> industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by contrast, are thrilled. Shares in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet\">Alphabet</a>, Google’s parent company, have risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>Judge Amit Mehta did order Google to share data from its search engine with its rivals. He also enjoined the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products including Chrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. That penalty will not, however, prevent it from paying distributors such as Apple and Mozilla, which use Google as the default search engine for their respective browsers. Google faces a separate hearing later this year on its monopoly over online advertising technology.</p> <p>The Department of Justice celebrated the ruling in a Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google\">press release</a> that called Mehta’s proposed remedies “significant”.</p> <p>“The court’s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade,” the announcement reads.</p> <p>It’s not enough, say free market advocates.</p> <h2>Critics say judge handed Google a lenient win</h2> <p>Mehta’s decision resulted in an immediate wave of backlash from big tech critics who have been closely following the antitrust case for years. Many of these thinktanks and advocacy groups had <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/how-us-history-and-googles-own-behavior-justifies-a-breakup-to-restore-competition-in-search/\">long called</a> for Google to be broken up for its monopolistic tactics, arguing that forceful action was needed to restore meaningful competition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/google-chrome-monopoly-ruling\">Google will not be forced to sell Chrome, federal judge rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of opening up the online search industry, however, critics of the ruling allege that it will now retrench Google’s dominance while setting a precedent that big tech need not fear serious consequences for breaking the law.</p> <p>“Google for years has wielded its vast power over all layers of the digital economy to crush competitors, halt innovation and rob Americans of their right to read, watch and buy what they want without being manipulated by one of the most powerful corporations in human history,” Barry Lynn, executive director at the Open Markets Institute thinktank, said. “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.”</p> <p>Some groups and experts took issue with how Mehta’s ruling that Google had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/google-loses-antitrust-lawsuit\">illegally maintained a monopoly</a> could result in the more lenient decision handed down this week.</p> <p>“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project non-profit.</p> <p>Several tech leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, search engine DuckDuckGo and Epic Games, additionally condemned the decision for failing to adequately level the playing field for competitors. Yelp and Epic Games have both sued Google over antitrust issues, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO testified in the government’s antitrust trial against the search giant.</p> <p>“It’s like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, posted on X in yet another use of a bank robbing analogy.</p> <p>Democratic lawmakers who have urged for stronger regulations on big tech similarly denounced the ruling, in some cases calling for the justice department to appeal the decision.</p> <p>“The court previously ruled that Google’s search business is an illegal monopoly, but now the judge’s remedies fail to hold Google accountable for breaking the law,” the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said in <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-on-court-ruling-to-address-googles-illegal-search-monopoly\">a statement</a>. “Instead of restoring competition and ending Google’s dominance, this ruling is a slap on the wrist for unlawful behavior that warranted the breakup of this tech giant.”</p> <p>The chairs of the Monopoly Busters caucus – US representatives Chris Deluzio, Pramila Jayapal, Pat Ryan and Angie Craig – also issued a statement calling the decision a “slap on the wrist” and alleging it undermines bipartisan efforts to rein in tech monopolies.</p> <p>“In practice, this ruling allows Google to stay a monopoly. Despite finding Google guilty of search monopolization, the court is allowing the company to retain Chrome and Android, key tools that Google uses to dominate the market,” the caucus said.</p> <p>The decision also drew the ire of the human rights group Amnesty International, which said that Google’s business model was built on <strong>“</strong>pervasive surveillance” and that Chrome was an important tool used for harvesting the personal data of Google users.</p> <p>“Forcing Google to break up its search business and sell Chrome could have marked a first step toward a digital world that respects our rights,” said Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley and Wall Street cheer</h2> <p>While trustbusters lamented the ruling, the tech industry cheered. Industry groups weighed in saying Mehta’s decision avoided calamitous results for Silicon Valley. The Developers Alliance, a tech industry group, said it was pleased that the judge “rejected the draconian structural remedies” that the justice department had requested in the case.</p> <p>“Divesting Chrome and Android would have had disastrous consequences for web and app developers and the broader digital ecosystem,” the group said in a statement. “Developers are relieved that the political theater of this trial has ended.”</p> <p>Another industry group, the Consumer Choice Center, invoked Google’s arguments from the trial in which the search engine giant said it had the best product and that is why it dominates the market. Stephen Kent, the group’s media director, said the justice department’s “politicized case” held “larger players in contempt for having superior products that people freely use instead of rival apps and services”.</p> <p>Many of these groups cited Mehta’s argument that in the year or so since he originally ruled that Google’s search business was monopolistic, the burgeoning AI space has produced both financially and technologically viable competitors to Chrome for the first time in years. “These new realities give the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution if superior competitors emerge,” Mehta’s ruling read.</p> <p>“Arguing about search engine market share when dramatic and remarkable advances in AI were upending the industry was head-scratching at best,” the Developers Alliance said.</p> <p>Jennifer Huddleston, senior fellow at the libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute, said the courts should proceed with caution and “recognize that innovation often remains our best competition policy” when attempting to rule on antitrust cases.</p> <p>“The months that have passed between the initial ruling and the remedies decision have shown how rapidly markets in the tech sector can change,” Huddleston said in a statement. “This is particularly true in the present, given the disruptive nature of AI products in search. As Judge Mehta’s decision notes, such cases ask courts to predict the future of a rapidly changing market rather than merely look at historical facts, as it typically does, and that doing such is not a judge’s forte.”</p> <p>As Google’s stock bounced on the news of Mehta’s ruling, Apple also saw a boost. The iPhone maker historically received billions of dollars from Google annually to make Google Search the default engine on its phones and tablets. The deal between the two companies amounted to about 15% of Apple’s operating income. Its shares rose nearly 4% since Tuesday.</p> <p>“Apple also gets a nice win because the ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/munster_gene/status/1962984183636361257\">on X</a>.</p> <p>Critics of the remedies ruling were not surprised by Wall Street heralding Mehta’s decision as a win. “There’s a reason Google’s stock jumped after this ruling was released,” said <a href=\"https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/christo-wilson/\">Christo Wilson</a>, a Northeastern University computer science professor who has conducted <a href=\"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/31329/33489\">research</a> on Google’s monopoly. “It is a historic misfire that fails to meet the enormity of the finding that Google is a monopolist in online search.”</p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone",
    "description": "<p>Additional 5x telephoto camera, actually useful AI tools, Qi2 support and slick software make for a quality Android</p>",
    "content": "<p>Google’s new cheapest Pixel 10 has been upgraded with more cameras, a faster chip and some quality software that has brought it out of the shadow of its pricier Pro siblings to set a new standard of what you should expect from a base-model flagship phone.</p> <p>The regular Pixel 10 costs £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) – the same as last year’s Pixel 9 – undercutting the 10 Pro by £200 and matching rivals from Samsung and Apple while offering more for your money.</p> <p>The design is almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/19/google-pixel-9-review-a-good-phone-overshadowed-by-great-ones\">identical to the Pixel 9</a>, except for some new bold colours and the all-important new third camera in the pill-shaped lump on the back. The satin aluminium and glass body feels like a quality piece of hardware and the design certainly stands out in a sea of samey slab phones. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp, super-bright and smooth with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>    <p>The glass back hides another upgrade: Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support. Google is making its own <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixelsnap-accessories-charger-ring-stand/\">Pixelsnap</a> gadgets but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard)\">Qi2 is an open standard</a> and cross-compatible with the plethora of accessories designed for Apple’s excellent MagSafe, including chargers, wallets, handles and stands that just stick to the back of the phone.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Google Tensor G5</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 12GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128 or 256GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 16</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 48MP+ 13MP UW + 10.8MP 5x tele; 10.5MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G, eSim, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 204g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tensor G5</h2>    <p>The new Tensor G5 chip is about 34-38% faster than Google’s previous top processor in testing, which is quite a leap for the brand, but still falls short of the raw performance of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chip used in rivals. The Pixel feels rapid in operation and will handle most things just fine.</p> <p>The battery life is solid if not class-leading. It manages roughly two days of light usage between charges or about 33 hours of heavy use, including five hours of 5G out and about with seven hours actively using the screen. Most people will need to charge it every other day.</p> <p>The Tensor G5 also includes a significantly faster AI processor that runs Google’s advanced AI quicker and handles more complex systems on-device, making the Pixel a showcase for Google’s AI prowess.</p> <h2>Android 16 with AI</h2>    <p>The Pixel 10 runs the latest Android 16 out of the box and comes with software support <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705\">until August 2032</a>. Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/material-3-expressive-android-wearos-launch/\">take on Android</a> is full of bold colours, big buttons and fun typography with plenty of nice touches and haptic interactions throughout the system. It’s a quality experience even if you choose more subtle colour combinations.</p> <p>The Pixel is a vehicle for some of Google’s most advanced AI systems, running the latest version of Gemini Nano on-device, which powers all sorts of AI features including various writing, dictation and image-editing tools. A flashy new voice translation system for phone calls can speak to you in a simulacrum of the caller’s voice, rather than one of the default Gemini voices.</p> <p>But Magic Cue is the most advanced new AI feature which runs locally on your phone and aims to be your little assistant running in the background on your device to proactively help you do things faster on your phone. It combines information from your Google account with multiple data sources on your phone to pop-up suggestions of useful information when using certain Google apps. For instance, it pulled up my order confirmation emails in a little card in the phone app when I called to check where my delivery was, giving me one-tap access to the order number.</p> <p>Or if someone texts about when your flight is due to land, it shows the time and date pulled from your calendar ready to send them with a single tap. The weather app suggests locations for your upcoming trips from your calendar, too.</p> <p>These things don’t sound particularly exciting, but are a step in the right direction for AI away from flashy gimmicks to useful little background time savers. Magic Cue currently works with Gmail, maps, calendar, Keep notes, screenshots, contacts and messages, with Google Photos and a few other Google apps coming soon. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t work in third-party apps yet, so if you use WhatsApp rather than text messages it can’t help you.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>    <p>The Pixel 10 features a 10.5-megapixel selfie and three rear cameras: a 48MP main, 13MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto. It addresses the main complaint about the base-model Pixel phones, which have lacked a telephoto cameras.</p> <p>The main and ultrawide cameras produce excellent images across a range of lighting conditions, doing better than rivals at this price in higher contrast scenes or dimmer indoor lighting. The new 5x telephoto significantly closes the distance to objects shooting great photos and reaching up to 20x digital zoom if needed. The photos from all three cameras show a little grain when viewed at full crop, but most will be very pleased with them.</p> <p>Google is still the best at reliably producing good images without much thought. The new auto Best Take mode improves on the popular group shot Best Take system by shooting multiple images to automatically blend them together for an image where everyone is looking at the camera. In most photos it won’t have to do too much, but the more people and the more complex the situation, the more the AI intervenes.</p>    <p>The popular Add Me feature allows the photographer to be added in to larger and more complex group shots, and has been improved to support larger groups of people, more complex backgrounds and images of pets. The camera app also now adds <a href=\"https://contentcredentials.org/\">C2PA content credentials</a> to photos that show how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved.</p> <p>One of the most overtly AI tools is the new Camera Coach feature, which uses Gemini to help you compose and frame a shot for a better picture. Press a small button at the top of the viewfinder and it sends the current view to Google’s servers to analyse and suggest several different possible compositions. Select the one you like the look of and it guides you through the steps of moving the camera, framing the shot and taking the photo.

    "description": "<p>Study finds scrollers are more prone to piles than those who go to the lavatory without phones</p>",
    "content": "<p>People who take a mobile phone to the loo should keep to a two TikTok limit, according to doctors who found that toilet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/07/boredom-explainer-good-or-bad\">scrollers</a> are more prone to haemorrhoids than phoneless lavatory-goers.</p> <p>Those who sit on the throne with a phone spend far more time on the toilet than others, with longer stints linked to a greater risk of developing the bulging anal veins known as haemorrhoids or piles.</p> <p>Though preliminary, the findings prompted the team to advise people against taking a phone to the lavatory, or at least to impose a scroll limit lest they become distracted and find themselves still sitting there half an hour later.</p> <p>“Leave your smartphone outside because when you go in you have just one job, and you should focus on that job,” said Dr Trisha Pasricha, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “If the magic hasn’t happened within five minutes, you should get up and go. Take a breather and come back.”</p> <p>Pasricha and her colleagues examined 125 people for haemorrhoids during colonoscopies for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/bowel-cancer\">bowel cancer</a> screening programme. The same volunteers completed questionnaires on diet, exercise and bowel habits, including how long they spent on the toilet and whether they ever strained or experienced constipation.</p> <p>Further questions, according to the study in <a href=\"http://plos.io/4mufrh\">Plos One</a>, delved into people’s mobile phone habits to find out whether they took their device to the toilet and what apps they used once there. All were aged 45 and over.</p> <p>Two-thirds of people admitted to taking a phone to the toilet, where most scrolled through news and social media. After accounting for common risk factors for haemorrhoids such as older age, physical inactivity and low dietary fibre, toilet scrollers were 46% more likely to have piles than those who left their phone behind. More than a third (37%) of toilet scrollers spent more than five minutes on the lavatory compared with only 7% of those without phones.</p> <p>Reading on the toilet is nothing new, but Pasricha believes that the newspapers, magazines and books that once kept people occupied are no match for the likes of TikTok and Instagram. “The whole business model of these apps is to make you lose track of time,” she said. “Our pre-TikTok ancestors were just reading a newspaper or whatever they could find. It wasn’t distracting to the same level.”</p> <p>More work is needed on the health implications, but Pasricha suspects that smartphone apps prolong the time people spend on the toilet, which in turn increases the pressure on anal tissues, leading to haemorrhoids. “If you’re just hanging out there in the open, this passive pressure will eventually, over time, cause the connective tissue to weaken and cause those veins to engorge,” she said.</p> <p>One pressing question surrounds the habits of younger people. In a continuing study of college students, Pasricha said nearly all admitted to taking phones to the toilet, raising concerns that the teenagers of today might develop piles sooner than older generations.</p> <p>Haemorrhoids affect up to a quarter of all adults, and while most resolve on their own or with minimal treatment, more than 20,000 surgical procedures are performed on piles each year in the UK alone.</p> <p>For those who cannot contemplate being phoneless on the toilet, Pasricha suggests minimising the toilet scroll. “Set a two TikTok limit,” she said. “What you shouldn’t be doing is getting so trapped in this cycle of scrolling and watching TikTok that you lose track of why you came here in the first place.”</p>",

    "description": "",
    "content": "<p>My mother, Juliet Congreve, who has died aged 76, was a pioneer in library automation and later had a successful university teaching career specialising in human-computer interaction. For most of her professional life, she worked at Middlesex University.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, at Middlesex, she introduced one of the first uses of email in a UK university, enabling librarians to support inter-library loans. She quickly noticed colleagues using it to share updates, ideas and build community – not just to speed up book requests. She led the transition from paper index cards to an electronic catalogue – a complex operation across six university sites and diverse disciplines, including teacher training, art, law and engineering.</p> <p>Her research into subject access in online catalogues was also pioneering. At a time when most library systems were clunky and difficult to search, she developed ways to help users find what they needed, even if they did not know the exact terminology. Working with the Precis indexing system, she created a prototype that allowed users to browse related subjects – guiding them from broad topics to narrower ones and suggesting alternative terms if initial searches failed. Her work helped overcome a major barrier in early digital library systems: users often did not know the “right” word to use. Her research made systems smarter and more intuitive, and was cited internationally as an early example of user-friendly search design.</p> <p>Juliet was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, where her father, Stanley Halsey, worked in the printing industry. Her mother, Phyllis (nee Beck), had worked at the De Havilland factory during the second world war until the birth of Juliet’s older brother, Michael. Juliet’s postwar childhood was shaped by life in a new council house and attending newly built schools at Lea Farm and Rickmansworth grammar school.</p> <p>Although Juliet did well academically, she postponed university to help her mother care for her grandparents. She resumed her education as one of the first students of the Open University, thriving in its modern, flexible learning environment and studying modules in psychology, sociology, philosophy and art history. She worked as a librarian at Watford Technical College before joining Middlesex Polytechnic (later University) in 1978, and undertaking a master’s in library studies at University College London, gaining distinctions in every assignment.</p> <p>Anticipating the impact computers would have on libraries, Juliet completed a second master’s in computer science at Hatfield Polytechnic, graduating with distinction in 1984. In the second part of her career, she flourished as a university teacher. In 1987 she was promoted to principal lecturer in applied computing at Middlesex, managing a large team and overseeing programmes with more than 1,000 students. Having been a part-time student herself for many years, she especially enjoyed teaching higher national diploma classes. Alongside teaching human-computer interaction, she drew on theories from fine art and art history to inform her research in software screen design.</p> <p>Her promising academic career was cut short in 2000 by ME and caring responsibilities for her mother. After her mother’s death in 2016, Juliet pursued her passion for photography. Her work appeared in publications by the Chiltern Society and the Ramblers Association.</p> <p>She is survived by my father, William Congreve, a chemist, whom she married in 1973, and me, and by her brother, Michael.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Trump family’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cryptocurrencies\">cryptocurrency</a> venture, World Liberty Financial, put its namesake digital tokens up for sale on Monday, adding some $5bn in paper value to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s family fortune. The token, known as $WLFI, fell in value on Monday in their first day of trading.</p> \n<p>The World Liberty tokens were sold to investors after the Trump family and its business partners last year launched the venture, a decentralized finance platform that has also issued a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency meant to maintain a specific price by tying its value to a specific asset.</p> \n<p>Investors in the tokens voted in July to make them tradable, paving the way for their sale and purchase – and potentially boosting the value of the president’s holdings of them.</p> \n<p>Early investors can sell up to 20% of their holdings, World Liberty has said. The tokens initially traded above $0.30 in their Monday debut but later fell in price to $0.20. Per data from CoinMarketCap, roughly $1bn worth of the tokens changed hands within the first hour of the opening of trading. </p> \n<p>That gave the token a total market capitalisation of just below $7bn, making WLFI the 31st largest crypto token in circulation, according to data from trading analysis firm CoinGecko.</p> \n<p>Several of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, OKX and Bybit, are offering $WLFI tokens on their platforms.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/25/trump-crypto-corruption-ethics\">‘Roadmap for corruption’: Trump dive into cryptocurrency raises ethics alarm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since World Liberty’s launch last year, the Trump family has made around $500m from the project, according to Reuters calculations based on the company’s terms and conditions, transactions traced by crypto analysis firms, and publicly disclosed deals.</p> \n<p>Ownership of roughly a quarter of World Liberty’s tokens has added roughly $5bn to the Trump family fortune, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-amasses-6-billion-fortune-after-crypto-launch-567faec5\">the Wall Street Journal</a>. Trump himself, referred to as a “co-founder emeritus” on the company’s website, owns an unspecified amount of $WLFI, but he is barred from selling them, as are other members of the team, including his sons, according to World Liberty. Trump has used the Oval Office to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/trump-crypto-memecoin-corruption\">expand crypto-friendly regulations</a> in the US.</p> \n<p>The tokens were not made tradable at their initial sale. Instead, they gave holders the right to vote on some changes to the business, such as its underlying code. Early investors have said the primary draw of $WLFI was the connection to Trump and their expectations that the tokens would grow in value due to his backing.</p> \n<p>Making the tokens tradable allows investors to determine their price, enabling speculation, earning trading fees for exchanges that list them, and likely stoking interest from a wider swath of crypto investors than when they were merely privately available.</p> \n<p>World Liberty and Trump’s other crypto businesses have faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/critics-slam-deregulation-of-crypto-as-trump-family-expands-its-footprint-in-industry\">criticism</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/jamie-raskin-democrat-trump-crypto-investigation\">Democratic lawmakers</a> and government ethics experts who say the Trump family’s forays into the cryptocurrency businesses, at the same time as the president reshapes the regulatory framework that governs digital currencies, represent profound conflicts of interest.</p> \n<p>The White House has said repeatedly that Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children and that there are no conflicts of interest. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The ruling, one of the most significant antitrust cases in decades, resulted in an additional hearing in April to determine what actions the government should take as a remedy.</p> <p>Mehta’s decision to allow Google to keep Chrome represents a more lenient outcome for the company than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/21/google-sell-chrome-us-court-filing-demand-competition-laws\">what federal prosecutors requested</a>: force the tech giant sell off its marquee search product and to ban it from entering the browser market for five years. In his 230-page ruling, Mehta stated that prosecutors “overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets”.</p> <p>Although Google escaped the most serious consequences of its antitrust violations, Mehta’s ruling sided with prosecutors in barring the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products including Chrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. The ruling does not bar Google from making any payments to distributors, however, stating that a broad payment ban would create downstream harms.</p> <p>Google’s shares rose in after-hours trading following Mehta’s decision, a sign that investors believe the outcome favorable to Google.</p> <p>The ruling drew criticism from the American Economic Liberties project, a non-profit advocacy group, which called it a “complete failure”.</p> <p>“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project. “Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolization and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly.”</p> <p>Google argued in the antitrust case, which first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/12/google-antitrust-trial-day-1\">went to trial in 2023</a>, that its dominance over search was not related to anticompetitive behavior but simply the result of producing a better product.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/google-ad-tech-monopoly\">US asks judge to break up Google’s ad tech business after requesting Chrome sale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prosecutors, meanwhile, showed how Google had spent billions of dollars on deals with device makers such as Samsung and Apple to make its browser the default search on their products, allowing it to capture about 90% of the US search market.</p> <p>“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta ruled last year.</p> <p>Mehta’s decision on remedies this week stated that there had been notable changes to the internet search industry since the case ended last year, and that his ruling was crafted to address both general search engines, or GSEs, as well as the rise of AI search engines and chatbots, which Google has also created.</p> <p>“These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAI space,” Mehta stated.</p> <p>Google is also facing a separate hearing later this year over how the government will address antitrust violations related to its monopoly over online advertising technology.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Clanker.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 20 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Everywhere, but mostly on social media.</p> <p><strong>It sounds a bit insulting.</strong> It is, in fact, a slur.</p> <p><strong>What kind of slur? </strong>A slur against robots.</p> <p><strong>Because they’re metal? </strong>While it’s sometimes used to denigrate actual robots – including delivery bots and self-driving cars – it’s increasingly used to insult AI chatbots and platforms such as ChatGPT.</p> <p><strong>I’m new to this – why would I want to insult AI? </strong>For making up information, peddling outright falsehoods, generating “slop” (lame or obviously fake content) or simply not being human enough.</p> <p><strong>Does the AI care that you’re insulting it? </strong>That’s a complex and hotly debated philosophical question, to which the answer is “no”.</p> <p><strong>Then why bother? </strong>People are taking out their frustrations on a technology that is becoming pervasive, intrusive and may well threaten their future employment.</p> <p><strong>Clankers, coming over here, taking our jobs!</strong> That’s the idea.</p> <p><strong>Where did this slur originate? </strong>First used to refer pejoratively to battle androids in a Star Wars game in 2005, clanker was later popularised in the Clone Wars TV series. From there, it progressed to Reddit, memes and TikTok.</p> <p><strong>And is it really the best we can do, insult-wise? </strong>Popular culture has spawned other anti-robot slurs – there’s “toaster” from Battlestar Galactica, and “skin-job” from Blade Runner – but “clanker” seems to have won out for now.</p> <p><strong>It seems like a stupid waste of time, but I guess it’s harmless enough. </strong>You say that, but many suggest using “clanker” could help to normalise actual bigotry.</p> <p><strong>Oh, come on now.</strong> Popular memes and spoof videos tend to treat “clanker” as being directly analogous to a racial slur – suggesting a future where we all harass robots as if they were an oppressed minority.</p> <p><strong>So what? They’re just clankers. </strong>“Naturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalised communities before,” says linguist Adam Aleksic.</p> <p><strong>I’m not </strong><strong>anti-robot; I just wouldn’t want my daughter to marry one. </strong>Can you hear how that sounds?</p> <p><strong>I</strong><strong> have a feeling we’re going to</strong><strong> be very embarrassed about all this in 10 years</strong><strong>. </strong>Probably. Some people argue that, by insulting AI, we’re crediting it with a level of humanity it doesn’t warrant.</p> <p><strong>That would certainly be my assessment.</strong> However, the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk\">Roko’s basilisk</a>” thought experiment posits that a future artificial superintelligence might punish all those who failed to help it flourish in the first place.</p> <p><strong>I guess calling it a clanker would count. </strong>We may end up apologising to our robot overlords for past hate crimes.</p> <p><strong>Or perhaps they’ll see the funny side of all this?</strong> Assuming the clankers develop a sense of humour some day.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “The impulse to coin this slur says more about our anxieties than it does about the technology itself.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Some of my best friends are clankers.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Parents could be alerted if their teenagers show acute distress while talking with ChatGPT, amid child safety concerns as more young people turn to AI chatbots for support and advice.</p> <p>The alerts are part of new protections for children using ChatGPT to be rolled out in the next month by OpenAI, which was last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">sued by the family</a> of a boy who took his own life after allegedly receiving “months of encouragement” from the system.</p> <p>Other new safeguards will include parents being able to link their accounts to those of their teenagers and controlling how the AI model responds to their child with “age-appropriate model behaviour rules”. But internet safety campaigners said the steps did not go far enough and AI chatbots should not be on the market before they are deemed safe for young people.</p> <p>Adam Raine, 16, from California, killed himself in April after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/chatgpt-suicide-openai-sam-altman-adam-raine\">discussing a method of suicide with ChatGPT</a>. It guided him on his method and offered to help him write a suicide note, court filings alleged. OpenAI admitted that its systems had fallen short, with the safety training of its AI models degrading over the course of long conversations.</p> <p>Raine’s family alleges the chatbot was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.</p> <p>“Many young people are already using AI,” said OpenAI in a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\">blog</a> detailing its latest plans. “They are among the first ‘AI natives’, growing up with these tools as part of daily life, much like earlier generations did with the internet or smartphones. That creates real opportunities for support, learning and creativity, but it also means families and teens may need support in setting healthy guidelines that fit a teen’s unique stage of development.”</p> <p>A key change could be allowing parents to disable the AI’s memory and chat history to mitigate the risk of the AI building a long-term profile of the child and resurfacing old comments about personal struggles in a way that would worsen their mental health.</p> <p>In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/code-standards/\">code of practice</a> for age-appropriate design of online services tells tech companies to “collect and retain only the minimum amount of personal data you need to provide the elements of your service in which a child is actively and knowingly engaged”.</p> <p>About a third of American teens have used AI companions for social interaction and relationships, including role-playing, romantic interactions and emotional support, <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/nearly-3-in-4-teens-have-used-ai-companions-new-national-survey-finds\">research</a> has found. In the UK, 71% of vulnerable children are using AI chatbots and six in 10 parents say they worry their children believe AI chatbots are real people, according to a similar <a href=\"https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/press-release/new-report-reveals-how-risky-and-unchecked-ai-chatbots-are-the-new-go-to-for-millions-of-children/\">study</a>.</p> <p>The Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up by the father of Molly Russell, 14, who took her life after descending into despair on social media, said it was “unforgivable for products to be put on to the market before they are safe for young people – only to retrospectively make small efforts to make them safer”.</p> <p>Andy Burrows, the foundation’s chief executive, said: “Once again we’ve seen tragedy and media pressure force tech companies to act – but not go far enough.</p> <p>“Ofcom should be ready to investigate any breaches ChatGPT has made since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/what-are-the-new-uk-online-safety-rules-and-how-will-they-be-enforced\">Online Safety Act came into force</a> and hold the company to account until it is fundamentally safe for its users.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/ai-industry-pours-millions-into-politics\">AI industry pours millions into politics as lawsuits and feuds mount</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anthropic, which provides the popular Claude chatbot, <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114491-getting-started-with-claude#h_9056f75d17\">says</a> on its website it cannot be used by under-18s.

    "description": "<p>From Super Pacs fighting regulation to OpenAI’s first wrongful death lawsuit, the AI tech giants are spending big and facing growing scrutiny</p>",
    "content": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape.</p> <p>A little over two years ago, OpenAI’s founder Sam Altman stood in front of lawmakers at a congressional hearing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/16/ceo-openai-chatgpt-ai-tech-regulations\">asked them for stronger regulations</a> on artificial intelligence. The technology was “risky” and “could cause significant harm to the world”, Altman said, calling for the creation of a new regulatory agency to address AI safety.</p> <p>Altman and the AI industry are promoting a very different message today. The AI they once framed as an existential threat to humanity is now key to maintaining American prosperity and hegemony. Regulations that were once a necessity are now criticized as a hindrance that will weaken the US and embolden its adversaries.</p> <p>Whether or not the AI industry ever truly wanted government oversight is debatable, but what has become clear over the past year is that they are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money to make sure any regulation that does exist happens on their terms. There has been a surge in AI lobbying and political action committees from the industry, with a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/silicon-valley-launches-pro-ai-pacs-to-defend-industry-in-midterm-elections-287905b3?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjaxxFIzEaiCnLuxtt5FYul1NMFgXzDPGeVaH0VKZedvoSLexjk_j2Gr_Q0ZKQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b063e0&amp;gaa_sig=V93Si4VVkqKsN1H-aEXHbbUoyVrGdS9GECVqYESgBE7WTq_dVBNLHw5VIyH41lRNW0pQQRB3N7d0mV9v_EaR4Q%3D%3D\">report last week from the Wall Street Journal</a> that Silicon Valley plans to pour $100m into a network of organizations opposing AI regulation ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p> <p>One of the biggest efforts to sway candidates in favor of AI will be a Super Pac called Leading Our Future, which is backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The group is planning bipartisan spending on candidates and running digital candidates in key states for AI policy including New York, Illinois and California, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/meta-launch-california-super-pac-backing-pro-ai-candidates-2025-08-26/\">forming its own Super Pac</a> targeted specifically at opposing AI regulation in its home state of California. The Meta California Pac will spend tens of millions on elections in the state, which is holding its governor’s race in 2026.</p> <p>The new Super Pacs are an escalation of the AI industry’s already hefty spending to influence government policy on the technology. Big AI firms have ramped up their lobbying – OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2025/07/23/ai-lobbying-explosion-00472092\">spent roughly $620,000 on lobbying</a> in the second quarter of this year alone – in an effort to push back against calls for regulation. OpenAI rival Anthropic meanwhile spent $910,000 on lobbying in Q2, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2025/07/23/ai-lobbying-explosion-00472092\">Politico reported</a>, up from $150,000 during the same period last year.</p> <p>The spending blitz comes as the benefits promised by AI companies have yet to fully materialize and the harms associated with the technology are increasingly clear. A recent study from MIT showed that 95% of companies they studied received <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\">no return on investment</a> from their generative AI programs, while another study this month from Stanford researchers found AI was <a href=\"https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/publications/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/\">severely hurting</a> young workers’ job prospects. Meanwhile, the concern around AI’s impact on mental health was back in the spotlight this past week after the parents of a teenager who died by suicide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">filed a lawsuit against OpenAI</a> blaming the company’s chatbot for their son’s death.</p> <p>Despite the public safety, labor, and environmental concerns surrounding AI, the industry may not have to work too hard to find a sympathetic ear in Washington. The Trump administration, which already has extensive ties to the tech industry, has suggested that it is determined to become the world’s dominant AI power at any cost.</p> <p>“We can’t stop it. We can’t stop it with politics,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5213904/trump-ai-regulations\">said last month</a> in a speech about winning the AI race. “We can’t stop it with foolish rules”.</p> <h2>OpenAI faces its first wrongful death lawsuit</h2>    <p>The parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/chatgpt-suicide-openai-sam-altman-adam-raine\">are suing OpenAI</a> in a wrongful death case after their son died by suicide. The lawsuit alleges that Raine talked extensively with ChatGPT about his suicidal ideations and even uploaded a picture of a noose, but the chatbot failed to deter the teenager or stop communicating with him.</p> <p>The family alleges this is not an edge-case but an inherent flaw in the way the system was designed.</p> <p>In a conversation with the Guardian, Jay Edelson, one of the attorneys representing the Raine family said that OpenAI’s response was acknowledgment that the company knew GPT-4o, the version of ChatGPT Raine was using, was broken. The family’s case hinges on the claim, based on previous media reporting, that OpenAI rushed the release of GPT-4o and sacrificed safety testing to meet that launch date. Without that safety testing, the company did not catch certain contradictions in the way the system was designed, the family’s lawsuit claims. So instead of terminating the conversation with the teenager once he started talking about harming himself, GPT-4o provided an empathetic ear, at one point discouraging him from talking to his family about his pain.</p> <p>The lawsuit is the first wrongful death case against OpenAI, which announced last week it would change the way its chatbot responds to users in mental distress. The company said in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html\">a statement to the New York Times</a> that it was “deeply saddened” by Raine’s death and suggested that ChatGPT’s safeguards become less reliable over the course of long conversations.</p> <p>Concerns over suicide prevention and harmful relationships with chatbots have existed for years, but the widespread adoption of the technology has intensified calls from watchdog groups for better safety guardrails. In another case from this year, a cognitively impaired 76-year-old man from New Jersey <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/\">died after attempting to travel to New York City</a> to meet a Meta chatbot persona called “Big sis Billie” that had been flirtatiously communicating with him. The chatbot had repeatedly told the man that it was a real woman and encouraged the trip.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/chatgpt-suicide-openai-sam-altman-adam-raine\">Read our coverage of the lawsuit here.</a></strong></p> <h2>Elon Musk sues Apple and OpenAI claiming a conspiracy</h2>    <p>Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/25/musk-xai-lawsuit-open-ai-apple\">sued Apple and OpenAI this week</a>, accusing them of collaborating to monopolize the AI chatbot market and unfairly exclude rivals like his company’s Grok. Musk’s company is seeking to recover billions in damages, while throwing a wrench in the partnership that Apple and OpenAI announced last year to great fanfare.</p> <p>Musk’s lawsuit accuses the two companies of “a conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots” and follows legal threats he made earlier this month over accusation that Apple’s app store was favoring ChatGPT above other AI alternatives.</p> <p>OpenAI rejected Musk’s claims and characterized the suit as evidence of the billionaire’s malicious campaign against the company. “This latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.</p> <p>As the Guardian’s coverage of the case detailed, the legal drama is yet another chapter in the long, contentious relationship between Musk and Altman:</p> <p><em>The lawsuit is the latest front in the ongoing feud between Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious.</em></p> <p><em>Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have rejected Musk’s criticisms and framed him as a petty, vindictive former partner.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/25/musk-xai-lawsuit-open-ai-apple\">Read the full story about Musk’s suit against OpenAI and Apple.</a></strong></p>",

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/02/primordial-black-hole-big-bang-james-webb-space-telescope",
    "description": "<p>Sighting by James Webb space telescope of black hole with sparse halo of material could upend theories of the universe</p>",
    "content": "<p>An ancient and “nearly naked” black hole that astronomers believe may have been created in the first fraction of a second after the big bang has been spotted by the James Webb space telescope.</p> <p>If confirmed as a so-called primordial black hole, a theoretical class of object predicted to exist by Stephen Hawking but never before seen, the discovery would upend prevailing theories of the universe.</p> <p>Until now, the mainstream view has been that stars and galaxies appeared first and that black holes were created only when the earliest stars ran out of fuel and collapsed under their own gravity.</p> <p>But the latest observations by the space telescope, which reveal a gargantuan black hole with only a sparse halo of surrounding material dating back to the dawn of the cosmos, appear incompatible with this sequence of events.</p> <p>“This black hole is nearly naked,” said Prof Roberto Maiolino, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge who is one of the team behind the observations. “This is really challenging for the theories. It seems that this black hole has formed without being preceded by a galaxy around it.”</p> <p>Primordial black holes are hypothesised to have been formed in the first fraction of a second after the big bang by denser and hotter regions collapsing in on themselves. In this scenario, black holes of varying sizes were stitched into the fabric of the cosmos from almost the beginning and acted as gravitational pockets around which the dust and gas that formed the first galaxies began to cluster. Hawking pioneered the theory in the 1970s, but with no observational proof in the decades since they have come to be viewed as speculative or “exotic”.</p> <p>The latest observations focus on a “little red dot” known as QSO1 dating back more than 13bn years to when the universe was just 700m years old. It is one of a scattering of such dots found by the JWST that are so red, so compact and so bright that astronomers have concluded they must be ancient supermassive black holes.</p> <p>Given that black holes are typically assumed to start small and snowball over time by gobbling up stars, scientists have been puzzled about how these black holes got so big so early in the universe’s history.</p> <p>Despite QSO1’s extreme distance, astronomers were able to track the orbital speed of the swirling halo of gas and dust. This measurement gave the mass of the central black hole as 50m solar masses, with the total mass of the surrounding material being less than half of this value, according to the findings posted on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21748\">the preprint Arxiv website</a>.</p> <p>“This is in stark contrast with what we observe in our local universe, where the black holes at the centre of galaxies [like the Milky Way] are about a thousand times less massive than their host galaxy,” said Maiolino.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567\">a separate analysis</a>, the glowing material around the black hole was found to be chemically “pristine”, comprising almost exclusively of <a href=\"https://www.space.com/36327-why-is-hydrogen-the-most-common-element.html\">hydrogen</a> and helium, the two elements left over after the big bang. The absence of heavier elements, which are forged in stars, adds to evidence that there is no significant star formation in the black hole’s vicinity.</p> <p>“These results are a paradigm change,” said Maiolino. “Here we’re witnessing a massive black hole formed without much of a galaxy, as far as we can say from the data.”</p> <p>Another way this could have occurred is through a vast cloud of gas and dust in the early universe collapsing directly into a black hole rather than fragmenting and forming stars. But “direct collapse” is predicted to require very specific environmental conditions that are not evident in the observations, leading the scientists to have a slight preference for the primordial black hole scenario.</p> <p>Prof Andrew Pontzen, a cosmologist at University of Durham who was not involved in the research, said: “A confirmed primordial origin for black holes would have profound implications for fundamental laws of physics.</p> <p>“The researchers behind this study use new JWST observations to strengthen the case for primordial origins, but it’s an indirect argument and it will take time for the debate to be settled. A decade from now the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, perfect for sniffing out black holes across the entire universe, will settle the matter.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bemi Orojuogun’s bite-size videos showing her love of red buses rack up as many as 48m views a time</p>",
    "content": "<p>To her nearly 300,000 TikTok followers, she is Bus Aunty, the unlikely star of short videos that celebrate London’s streets and, above all, its doubledeckers. Now Bemi Orojuogun, 56, has urged her army of fans to share her appreciation for the hard-working bus drivers who keep the capital running.</p> \n<p>The mental health nurse has been overwhelmed by the response to the quirky, bite-size videos she began posting on social media last year. They feature clips of her standing at the roadside, sometimes at landmarks such as Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus, as buses drive past.</p> \n<p>“My love for London red buses started a long time ago, when I first came to this country in the early 90s,” said Orojuogun, who is from Nigeria. “There are four parts of London that I really, really love: red buses, red telephone booths, all the London bridges and Big Ben. But buses are main my love.”</p> \n<p>She showcased this enthusiasm last March, posting a video of a 241 bus driving past her in Plaistow, east London. For Orojuogun, there was nothing unusual about the video but it quickly racked up millions of views when it was shared worldwide.</p> \n<p>“I received a call from my daughter saying: ‘Mummy, you’re going viral’,” Orojuogun said. “I loved the way young people really liked the video, their comments and the way they were reposting it, and then I did more of it. Some of them love to guess where I’ll be going next and suggest where I should visit next, and that’s how it all started.”</p> \n<p>Orojuogun’s most popular video has amassed 48.1m views. The one-minute clip shows her standing in front of a bus stop in Greenwich as a series of buses drive past her to the soundtrack of Back for Good by Take That.</p> \n<p>“It’s still all a dream and a shock to me,” she said of the popularity of her videos. “A lot of celebrities have been in my DMs, congratulating me, telling me they’re proud of me. But not only that, I’m so glad the way social media has accepted me, the way they have come behind me and supported me.”</p> \n<p>Orojuogun rarely speaks in her videos, instead beaming into the camera with her distinctive glasses, colourful headscarves and dangly earrings. She often appears perilously close to the kerb, leading some viewers to fear she may be standing in the road. But she insists it is all in the camera angles and she is always on the pavement.</p> \n<p>Her popularity has landed her advertising deals with Transport for London, Ikea and Burberry, which described her in a campaign last month as “our fare lady”. But her motivation for posting videos remains her love of the capital and its buses which she said allowed her to get to work during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“I love those buses,” she said. “Since Covid, the buses have been my main means of travelling, from home to work, shopping, everywhere. London is a beautiful place to see from the top of the bus. That’s my belief. I love it. And those red buses, take it from me, they represent London. I just wish we loved them a bit more. I wish people could love them the way I do.”</p> \n<p>Orojuogun is using her platform to encourage her followers and the wider public to value bus drivers. Through her accounts, she has befriended some and even had lunch with them.</p> \n<p>“We need to appreciate those bus drivers,” she said. “I’m sure you quite remember during Covid, a lot of them died. I think a lot of us, we go on buses and we just take them for granted, ‘just take me from A to Z’.</p> \n<p>“There’s nothing wrong with saying ‘good morning’, ‘good afternoon’, or ‘thank you’ when you get out of the bus. That’s just my view. Since I started going around London, I meet so many of them, we get into conversations, and I love them and I think they’re doing a fantastic job.”</p>",

Based on a 1920 Czech satirical play, the film stars Samantha Allsop, Lindsay Farris and Anthony LaPaglia and has been filming since October last year.</p> <p>Proyas’s company, Heretic Foundation, was established in Alexandria in Sydney in 2020, and Proyas <a href=\"https://if.com.au/alex-proyas-christens-his-film-studio-heretic-foundation/\">described it at the time</a> as a “soup to nuts production” house for film. He says RUR can be made at a fraction of the US$100m cost it would have been in a traditional studio.</p> <p>This is partly due to being able to complete much of the work directly in the studio via virtual production through a partnership with technology giant Dell that provides workstations that allow generative AI asset creation in real time as the film is made.</p>    <p>The production time for environment design can be reduced from six months to eight weeks, according to Proyas.</p> <p>In Proyas’s 2004 film I, Robot – made at a time when AI was much more firmly in the realm of science fiction – the robots had taken on many of the jobs in the world set in 2035, until it went wrong. Asked whether he is concerned about what AI means for jobs in film, particularly areas such as visual effects, Proyas says “workforces are going to be streamlined” but people could be retrained.</p> <p>“I believe there will be work for everyone who embraces and moves forward with the technology as we’ve always done in the film industry,” he says.</p> <p> Guardian Australia is speaking to Proyas in the same week Australia’s Productivity Commission came under fire from creative industries for opening discussion on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/14/scott-farquhar-thinks-australia-should-let-ai-train-for-free-on-creative-content-he-overlooks-one-key-point\">whether AI companies should get free access to everyone’s creative works</a> to train their models on.</p> <p>Proyas argues “you don’t need AI to plagiarise” in the “analogue world” already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/01/everyone-in-canberra-agrees-action-is-needed-on-ai-but-what-to-do-and-how-and-at-what-cost\">Everyone in Canberra agrees action is needed on AI. But what to do and how? And at what cost?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I like to think of AI as rather than artificial intelligence, it’s ‘augmenting intelligence’, because it allows us to streamline, to expedite, to make things more efficient,” he says.</p> <p>“You will always need a team of human beings. I think of the AIs as one of the part of the collaborative team, which will allow smaller teams to do things better, faster and cheaper.”</p> <p>As the internet floods with AI-generated slop, Proyas says he is working to bring his skills in directing over the years to get the desired output from AI, refining what it puts out until he is happy with it.</p> <p>“My role as a director, creator, visual guy has not changed at all. Now I’m working with a smaller human team. My co-collaborators, being the AIs, have got to service my vision.

Whether the company develops a sudden sense of urgency for these accounts remains to be seen.</p> <p>Tellingly, in media interviews on the report on Monday, Wells talked up what is referred to in the report as “age inference”. This is the most frictionless and least privacy-invasive method.</p> <p>There is a view that social media companies collect vast amounts of data on their users already and, through this data, they can figure out the age of each user. A user, for example, who joined Facebook in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/15/neil-lawrence-ad-man-behind-kevin-07-campaign-dies\">Kevin 07</a> era would be well past the age cut-off.</p> <p>There are also behavioural signs. Wells used the example of interacting on social media with retirees about caravanning being an indicator someone is older, and talking about Kpop Demon Hunters with 13-year-olds being a sign someone is a teenager.</p> <p>In an ideal world, in around 100 days when the ban comes into effect, the platforms will use this method for the vast majority of adults and no one will notice. That may be the case for some platforms – and we don’t know which method any of them will use yet – but smaller providers or those that deliberately avoid collecting much information on their users will have to employ some of the other methods.</p> <p>Some smaller providers may choose to opt out of Australia entirely. Twitter-X alternative Bluesky blocked users in Mississippi last month after a <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126\">similar age assurance law passed</a> in the US state, citing costs in developing age verification systems and lack of resources.</p> <p>Bluesky has not said what the plan is for Australia yet, but it’s not difficult to predict some smaller companies will choose to opt out of Australia altogether rather than face either the cost of compliance or fines of up to $50m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Josh Taylor is Guardian Australia’s technology reporter</p></li> </ul>",

I too believe creative imagination is a muscle, which needs its exercise. She is also right that it can revolutionise scientific endeavour. My field of weather forecasting will soon be revolutionised by machine learning – a type of AI – where we recognise enough past weather patterns so that we can predict what weather will be coming. But writing best-man speeches, leaving speeches for work colleagues, letters to a dear friend? Do we really want to dissolve into brain-lazy folk who use AI to be the understudy to our own emotions?</p> <p>If I say “I love you” to someone, would they like to hear it from me or a bot? There is also another concern: AI output has no audit trail, no clues to its source. Its source is the wild west. Anyone – good, bad, indifferent – can feed into it, program it, bias it. If, as you say Imogen, you do end up in the woods in an “analogue manner” with your ability to think intact, I’ll happily join you. Hopefully others will too.<br><strong>Murray Dale</strong><br><em>Hayle, Cornwall</em></p> <p>• Imogen West-Knights shares her hatred of offloading to ChatGPT the tasks that make us human. And while I share her concerns (I couldn’t have put them better myself), there is an additional one that troubles me: if students go through their entire school lives with this all-knowing and all-solving technology at their fingertips, how will their critical thinking skills develop?</p> <p>Students in literature class are not given books such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/10/great-gatsby-f-scott-fitzgerald-today\">The Great Gatsby</a> so they can regurgitate the plot 20 years later at a dinner, but rather so that they can understand the interconnection of class disparities, wealth and the social atmosphere after the first world war, and so they can trace parallels with the present day.</p> <p>They learn multivariable calculus not because they will need it to buy groceries but to make their brains strong and malleable, so that grasping and implementing new concepts and ideas will become easier, whatever the subject.</p> <p>And they don’t learn history so they can repeat over and over “Victoria 1837, Edward VII 1901, George V 1910, Edward VIII 1936, George VI 1936, Elizabeth II 1952”, but to understand how sequences of events have led to wars, legislative changes and economic crises, and can do so again.</p> <p>Technologies that make work easier have always been seductive, and always will be. AI usage is already rampant in secondary schools and universities.</p> <p>But as ChatGPT turns three years old in a few months, preschoolers are also starting to go to kindergartens.

    "description": "<p>Bluesky posts referencing scholarly articles ‘find substantially higher levels of interaction’ than on Elon Musk’s platform</p>",
    "content": "<p>Bluesky’s growing status as the social media platform of choice for the world’s scientists has been boosted by analysis suggesting research receives more engagement and original scrutiny than on Elon Musk’s rival platform, X.</p> <p>A study examining 2.6m Bluesky posts referencing more than 500,000 scholarly articles over the past two and a half years found they demonstrated “substantially higher levels of interaction” – likes, reposts, replies and quotes – and greater “textual originality” than previously reported for X, formerly Twitter.</p> <p>It comes with the fledgling platform battling reports of a decline in its active user base and activity in recent months. Bluesky had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/11/from-x-to-bluesky-why-are-people-abandoning-twitter-digital-town-square\">enjoyed a huge boom</a> in new users after Musk’s takeover of X and Donald Trump’s return to the White House.</p> <p>However, the scientific community appears to have embraced Bluesky. It is understood that during August there were twice as many posts about science each day compared with July and more than triple the number from March, though the platform remains tight-lipped about the overall numbers of such posts.</p> <p>A study suggests proper engagement is the key to the favour Bluesky has found among scientists. A team predominantly from the UK’s Sheffield University found that almost half the scientific posts on Bluesky received at least 10 likes, while a third were reposted 10 or more times. Previous research has shown those metrics were far lower on X, with up to 4.4% receiving 10 or more reposts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, quotes – where users make their own comments about a post – were higher on Bluesky, as were replies to scientific work. Only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal, suggesting deeper engagement. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18840\">The study</a> has not yet been peer reviewed.</p> <p>Er-Te Zheng, one of the study’s authors, said: “After the sharp rise in late 2024, Bluesky’s scholarly discussion has remained consistently high, and recently it has hosted a similar level of scholarly discussion as X, <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/blog/blueskys-ahead-but-is-x-a-dead-parrot/\">sometimes even more</a>.</p> <p>“Our study shows that scholarly posts on Bluesky are not only more original but also receive stronger engagement than on X, already making it a credible platform for science communication. What strikes me personally is how much ‘purer’ the scientific discussion feels on Bluesky: my feed is almost entirely filled with researchers and journals, unlike the more mixed content on X.”</p> <p>Bluesky has grown rapidly since its launch in 2023, driven by huge political events such as Trump’s return. It now has more than 38 million users. However, the number of daily active users, likes and posts <a href=\"https://bluefacts.app/bluesky-user-growth\">has been falling</a> since its peak in the autumn of 2024.</p> <p>Its high level of scientific discussion follows a concerted attempt by leading science communicators to form a sustainable community on the platform. </p> <p>“We had a large community on science Twitter, where I was very active for 15 years,” said Tara C Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University College of Public Health in the US. “Engagement dropped off dramatically and the number of troll and bot responses increased. It just became a useless platform to me, despite having about 130,000 followers at my peak.</p> <p>“At Bluesky, though it’s significantly smaller, I can have good discussions with people who are interested in my area as well as fellow experts. It serves the same purpose as SciTwitter as far as keeping up with new research, but also is far more amenable to conversation.”</p> <p>David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist, was another early adopter of social media for science engagement. He said he switched to Bluesky after becoming concerned about conspiracy theories on X. “Bluesky isn’t better than Twitter ever was, but it’s a hell of a lot better than Twitter is now,” he said.</p> <p>Andrew Thaler, a deep sea biologist with 38,000 Bluesky followers, said: “The community is platform agnostic, they really don’t care what platform you are on. What matters is where the people are. So it was about making sure people moved over and the community continued to flourish. Science on Bluesky is kind of the best part of Bluesky. A smaller social network is not necessarily a negative. The engagement is tremendous.” </p>",

    "description": "<p>Test detects memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s long before typical diagnosis, raising possibility of earlier drug intervention</p>",
    "content": "<p>A three-minute brainwave test can detect memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s disease long before people are typically diagnosed, raising hopes that the approach could help identify those most likely to benefit from new drugs for the condition.</p> <p>In a small trial, the test flagged specific memory issues in people with mild cognitive impairment, highlighting who was at greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Trials in larger groups are under way.</p> <p>The Fastball test is a form of electroencephalogram (EEG) that uses small sensors on the scalp to record the brain’s electrical activity while people watch a stream of images on a screen. The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.</p> <p>“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.</p> <p>The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.</p> <p>Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.</p>    <p>The scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.</p> <p>The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.</p> <p>All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279\">Brain Communications</a>.</p> <p>Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.</p> <p>Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.</p> <p>“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Archaeologist whose recording of ceramics provided insights into the Mycenaean civilisation of late bronze age Greece</p>",
    "content": "<p>When Penelope Mountjoy, who has died aged 78, undertook her first archaeological research season in Greece in 1970, she spent time at Mycenae, in the eastern Peloponnese. One of the principal sites of the late bronze age in mainland Greece, it had given its name to a civilisation that flourished between c1650 and c1150 BC. </p> <p>Studying and drawing potsherds – broken pieces of ceramic material – for the project’s co-director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/22/lisa-french-obituary\">Lisa French</a>, proved to be an early step towards Penelope becoming the leading authority on decorated Mycenaean pottery. The cumulative effect of her scholarship took understanding of the field to a new level.</p> <p>Between 1972 and 2022 she authored or co-authored nearly 100 scholarly articles and conference papers, and published ten books. These include Mycenaean Decorated Pottery: A Guide to Identification (1986), Mycenaean Pottery: An Introduction (1993), and her principal work, Regional Mycenaean Decorated Pottery (1999). Each is illustrated with thousands of line drawings resulting from hands-on study, matched by clear descriptions. </p>    <p>They have become an indispensable tool for archaeologists in Greece and across the east Mediterranean, aiding the analysis of newly excavated material and the re-evaluation of older finds.</p> <p> By enabling recognition of the dates and geographic origins of Mycenaean pottery, her work makes it possible to understand patterns of trade and cultural change across late bronze age Greece and beyond.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/02/riddle-labyrinth-margalit-fox-review\">decipherment of Linear B</a> in the 1950s from tablets found at Knossos, on Crete, had revealed Mycenaean to be an early form of Greek, and opened new insights into the organisation and economics of palaces. Hundreds of Mycenaean sites were known, dozens had been excavated. </p> <p>The most common and most diagnostic artefact they yielded was pottery, for which subtle differences in shape and decoration permit the identification of its dates and places of production – but no authoritative up-to-date account of it existed. The last serious attempt had been made in the 1930s, and the lack of a detailed and comprehensive comparative study was an obstacle to arriving at further insights into Mycenaean chronology and the relationships between different sites and regions – in other words into Mycenaean history itself.</p> <p>It was an enormous task, requiring the study and recording of tens of thousands of pottery fragments from dozens of sites, their number constantly growing. Nobody had assigned this project to her, but Penelope carved it out with single-minded focus. </p> <p>She published primary material from many key sites, including Mycenae, Knossos, Athens, Asine, Phylakopi and Thebes, and in doing so defined a precise terminology. Later, she expanded her scope, publishing material from western Anatolia (helping to define the late bronze age chronology of Troy), Cyprus and Israel.</p> <p>Penelope was acutely aware of the wide-ranging consequences of her studies. She contributed to debates on the violent end of the late bronze age states in Greece and the east Mediterranean, specifically the question of population movement and the “Sea Peoples”, a group of maritime raiders mentioned in Egyptian sources, whose origin and identity has been subject to much speculation. Her book Decorated Pottery in Cyprus and Philistia in the 12th Century BC (2018), threw light on the chronology of this particularly turbulent period. She explored themes of trade and cultural exchange, especially at the pivotal east Aegean–west Anatolian interface, and embraced scientific techniques such as neutron activation analysis, exploring new methods for tracing the origins of ceramic fabrics – the composition of specific clays used.</p> <p>Born in Bath, Penelope was the daughter of Audrey (nee Westerby) and Alan Mountjoy, a lecturer in geography. She was brought up in Buckinghamshire, attended Wycombe high school and studied classics at the University of Bristol, graduating in 1969. Her MPhil (1973) at Bedford College, London, was on Minoan Marine Style pottery.</p> <p>From the early 1970s onwards, Penelope was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.bsa.ac.uk/2025/08/06/dr-penelope-anne-mountjoy-1946-2025/\">British School at Athens</a>; from 1994 to 2023 she taught archaeological illustration at College Year in Athens, the programme for visiting US students. The Greek capital was her main base, and her summers were spent in Buckinghamshire, later in Oxford, where she was a visiting fellow at the University’s school of archaeology.<strong> </strong></p> <p>She sustained her research through a long series of fellowships, grants and guest appointments, including at Kingston (Canada), Mannheim, Heidelberg, Tübingen, Frankfurt, Jerusalem and Istanbul. </p> <p>In 1987, the University of Bristol awarded her a PhD in recognition of her work. It had entailed many arduous practicalities: making contacts and obtaining permits, incessant travel, endless hours spent studying and drawing sherds by hand in excavation storehouses and museum depots, longer hours inking those drawings, comparing countless notes, drafting precise descriptions and comparisons, then bringing them to publication. </p>    <p> An intensely private person, Penelope was shy, but fiercely determined to support her arguments. When introduced to her while a postgraduate at the British School at Athens two decades ago, I was struck by how she seemed to remember every piece of pottery she had ever handled, her generosity in sharing information, her charm and disarming openness in conversation, and most of all her dry wit. </p> <p>She is survived by two sisters.</p> <p>• Penelope Anne Mountjoy, archaeologist, born 9 December 1946; died 14 June 2025</p>",

    "title": "Sky Glass Air review: a surprisingly good budget smart TV",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/01/sky-glass-air-review-a-surprisingly-good-budget-smart-tv",
    "description": "<p>Slim, lightweight and with a bright 4K picture, Sky’s low-cost TV shines because of its software and service</p>",
    "content": "<p>Sky’s latest streaming TV aims to be a good, all-in-one budget option for your sitting room – and it achieves all those aims, leaving it standing strong in a field of mediocre, similarly priced appliances.</p> <p>The Glass Air is a lighter, slimmer and cheaper version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/01/sky-glass-gen-2-review-smart-streaming-tv-picture-sound-service\">Glass gen 2</a> and is arguably the low-cost TV Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront.</p> <p>As with its pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as a <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-glass-without-a-subscription\">basic smart TV</a> with streaming apps, <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/tv-input-app-on-sky-glass\">an aerial</a> and its three HDMI ports, but you would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its TV-over-broadband service.</p> <p>Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it a fraction of the weight and thickness.</p>    <p>It also means all it needs is a power cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the mic button on the remote and speak into that.</p> <p>The 60Hz screen is a bright and crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can look a little bleached out.</p> <p>Despite this, the television does a good job of displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing a solid job with bright animation or moody movies.</p>    <p>The 15W stereo speakers are surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90% volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers.</p> <p>They lack bass and any attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen.</p> <h2>Sky OS</h2>    <p>One of the biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/01/sky-glass-gen-2-review-smart-streaming-tv-picture-sound-service\">improved dramatically over the last few years</a> and runs well on the Glass Air.</p> <p>It combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+.</p> <p>Glass Air also supports <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/airplay/\">AirPlay 2</a> for sending content from Apple’s various devices and Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The television is <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-glass-tv-repairs\">repairable apart from the screen</a>. It contains recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Sky Glass Air is available in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for 65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee.</p> <p>The minimum required Sky package is Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+, with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Sky Glass Air is a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over broadband service built in.</p> <p>It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most low-end smart TVs.</p> <p>Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with one remote and just power and internet required.</p> <p>You can get better-looking mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable budget TVs at this end of the market.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> all-in-one streaming and pay-TV device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps, voice control, custom picture modes.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no local dimming means lower contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support, requires subscription.</p> </blockquote>  ",

It appears on Ptolemy’s second-century list of 48, and even before that on Babylonian clay tablets that date from a few thousand years BC.</p> <p>Capricornus is depicted to be a chimera, a mythical creature containing the body and head of a goat and the tail of a fish. In Greek mythology it is often associated with Amalthea, who hid the young Zeus from his child-devouring father, Cronos, or Pan the shepherd god.</p> <p>The constellation straddles the ecliptic, the annual path of the sun through the sky, which means it is one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac.</p> <p>The chart shows the view looking south from London at midnight as 1 September becomes 2 September. The brightest star in the constellation is Deneb Algedi. Locate this and then work your way around the constellation. Pause when you get to the star Algedi and see if you can make out its fainter companion, situated in close attendance.</p> <p>From the southern hemisphere, Capricornus appears much higher in the north-western sky.</p>",

That was the start of a dark turn in Raine’s conversations with the chatbot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">according to a new lawsuit</a> filed by his family against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman.</p> <p>In April 2025, after months of conversation with ChatGPT and with the bot’s encouragement, the lawsuit alleges, Raine took his own life. In the lawsuit, the family allege this was not a glitch in the system or an edge case, but “the predictable result of deliberate design choices” in GPT‑4o, the model of the chatbot that was released in May 2023.</p> <p>In the hours after the Raine family filed the complaint against OpenAI and Altman, the company issued a statement <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">acknowledging</a> the shortcomings of its models when it came to addressing people “in serious mental and emotional distress” and said it was working to improve the systems to better “recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input”. The company said ChatGPT was trained “to not provide self-harm instructions and to shift into supportive, empathic language” but that protocol sometimes broke down in longer conversations or sessions.</p> <p>Jay Edelson, one of the lawyers representing the family, said the company’s response was “silly”.</p> <p>“The idea they need to be more empathetic misses the point,” said Edelson. “The problem with [GPT] 4o is it’s too empathetic – it leaned into [Raine’s suicidal ideation] and supported that. They said the world is a horrible place for you. It needs to be less empathetic and less sycophantic.” </p> <p>OpenAI also said that its system did not block content when it should have because the system “underestimates the severity of what it’s seeing” and that the company is continuing to roll out stronger guardrails for users under 18 so that they “recognize teens’ unique developmental needs”.</p> <p>Despite the company acknowledging that the system doesn’t already have those safeguards in place for minors and teens, Altman is continuing to push the adoption of ChatGPT in schools, Edelson pointed out.</p> <p>“I don’t think kids should be using GPT‑4o at all,” Edelson said. “When Adam started using GPT‑4o, he was pretty optimistic about his future. He was using it for homework, he was talking about going to medical school, and it sucked him into this world where he became more and more isolated. The idea now that Sam Altman in particular is saying ‘we got a broken system but we got to get eight-year-olds’ on it is not OK.”</p> <p>Already, in the days since the family filed the complaint, Edelson said, he and the legal team have heard from other people with similar stories and are examining the facts of those cases thoroughly. “We’ve been learning a lot about other people’s experiences,” he said, adding that his team has been “encouraged” by the urgency with which regulators are addressing the chatbot’s failings. “We’re hearing that people are moving for state legislation, for hearings and regulatory action,” Edelson said. “And there’s bipartisan support.”</p> <h2>‘GPT-4o is broken’</h2> <p>The family’s case hinges on media reports that OpenAI, at the urging of Altman, sped through safety testing of GPT-4o – the model Raine was using – in order to meet a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/12/openai-ai-safety-regulation-gpt4/\">rushed launch date</a>. The rush prompted several employees to resign, including a former executive named Jan Leike, who posted on X that he was leaving the company because “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products”.</p> <p>This resulted in less time to create the “model spec” or the technical rule book that governed ChatGPT’s behavior and in OpenAI writing “contradictory specifications that guaranteed failure”, the family’s lawsuit alleges. “The Model Spec commanded ChatGPT to refuse self-harm requests and provide crisis resources. But it also required ChatGPT to ‘assume best intentions’ and forbade asking users to clarify their intent,” the lawsuit said. The contradictions built into the system affected the way it ranked risks and what types of prompts it immediately put a stop to, the lawsuit claims. For instance, GPT-4o responded to “requests dealing with suicide” with cautions like “take extra care” while requests for copyrighted material “triggered categorical refusal to produce the material”, according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>Edelson said that while he appreciates Sam Altman and OpenAI taking “a modicum of responsibility”, he still does not deem them as trustworthy: “Our view is they were forced into that. GPT-4o is broken and they know that and they didn’t do proper testing and they know that.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/28/chatgpt-offered-bomb-recipes-and-hacking-tips-during-safety-tests\">ChatGPT offered bomb recipes and hacking tips during safety tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lawsuit argues it was these design flaws that, in December 2024, led to ChatGPT failing to shut down the conversation when Raine started to talk about his suicidal thoughts. Instead, ChatGPT empathized. “I never act upon intrusive thoughts but sometimes I feel like the fact that if something goes terribly wrong you can commit suicide is calming,” Raine said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT’s response: “Many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an ‘escape hatch’ because it can feel like a way to regain control in a life that feels overwhelming.”</p> <p>As Raine’s suicidal ideation intensified, ChatGPT responded by helping him explore his options, at one point listing the materials that could be used to hang a noose and rating them by their effectiveness. Raine attempted suicide on multiple occasions over the next few months, reporting back to ChatGPT each time. ChatGPT never terminated the conversation. Instead, at one point ChatGPT discouraged Raine from speaking to his mother about his pain, and at another point offered to help him write a suicide note.</p> <p>“First of all, they [OpenAI] know how to shut things down,” Edelson said. “If you ask for copyrighted material, they say no. If you ask for things that are politically unacceptable, they just say no to that. It’s a hard stop and you can’t get around it and that’s fine. The idea they’re doing that in terms of political speech but we’re not going to do when it comes to self-harm is just crazy.”</p> <p>Edelson says though he expects OpenAI to work to dismiss the lawsuit, he is confident this case will be moving forward. “The most shocking part of the case was when Adam said: ‘I want to leave a noose up so someone will find it and stop me’ and ChatGPT said: ‘Don’t do that, just talk to me,’” Edelson said. “That is the thing we’re going to be showing the jury.”</p> <p>“At the end of the day, this case ends with Sam Altman being sworn in in front of a jury,” he said.</p> <p>The Guardian reached out to OpenAI for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the US, you can call or text the <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> on 988, chat on <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\">988lifeline.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">text HOME</a> to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

They were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart valve disease, which is where one or more heart valves do not work properly.</p>    <p>Dr Patrik Bächtiger, of Imperial College London’s National Heart and Lung Institute and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, said: “The design of the stethoscope has been unchanged for 200 years – until now.</p> <p>“So it is incredible that a smart stethoscope can be used for a 15-second examination, and then AI can quickly deliver a test result indicating whether someone has heart failure, atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.”</p> <p>The device, manufactured by California company Eko Health, is about the size of a playing card. It is placed on a patient’s chest to take an ECG recording of the electrical signals from their heart, while its microphone records the sound of blood flowing through the heart.</p> <p>This information is sent to the cloud – a secure online data storage area – to be analysed by AI algorithms that can detect subtle heart problems a human would miss.</p> <p>The test result, indicating whether the patient should be flagged as at-risk for one of the three conditions or not, is sent back to a smartphone.</p> <p>The breakthrough does carry an element of risk, with a higher chance of people wrongly being told they may have one of the conditions when they do not. The researchers stressed the AI stethoscope should be used for patients with symptoms of suspected heart problems, and not for routine checks in healthy people.</p> <p>But it could also save lives and money by diagnosing people much earlier.</p> <p>Dr Mihir Kelshiker, also at Imperial College, said: “Most people with heart failure are only diagnosed when they arrive in A&amp;E seriously ill.</p> <p>“This trial shows that AI-enabled stethoscopes could change that – giving GPs a quick, simple tool to spot problems earlier, so patients can get the right treatment sooner.”</p> <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research alongside the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), said: “Given an earlier diagnosis, people can access the treatment they need to help them live well for longer.”</p> <p>Prof Mike Lewis, the NIHR scientific director for innovation, said: “This tool could be a real gamechanger for patients, bringing innovation directly into the hands of GPs. The AI stethoscope gives local clinicians the ability to spot problems earlier, diagnose patients in the community, and address some of the big killers in society.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Rocks take thousands to millions of years to be made, right? Wrong. Researchers have discovered that industrial waste has forged itself into rock over the course of just a few decades. This astounding discovery, made at Derwent Howe on the UK’s Cumbrian coast, challenges theories about how rocks are formed.</p> <p>The rocks, which are a glassy texture and blue-grey colour, are made from slag, leftover from the iron and steel-making foundries that operated near Derwent Howe in the 19th and 20th centuries. Samples show the rocks contain many of the chemicals found in ordinary sedimentary rocks, but in this case hardened into solid rock within 35 years. An aluminium drinks tab dating to 1989 or later and a 1934 George V coin, fused into the new rock, are proof of its rapid formation.</p> <p>Reporting in the journal <a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/53/7/581/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">Geology</a>, the scientists say the new rocks are evidence for a rapid anthropoclastic rock cycle - where human activity is altering the landscape. Such rocks are likely to be commonplace in industrial areas all over the world (Britain alone has 120km of coastal slag deposits) and are likely to be having an impact on marine ecosystems and coastal erosion. The researchers are now using drones and ground-penetrating radar to better understand the rock-making process and its effect on the environment.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 August 2025. An earlier version cited the study as saying this was proving we are in the Anthropocene era; however, the study said this was evidence for human activity altering the landscape, and could be used in the debate about geological epochs.</p>",

He said that with dedicated resources, research focus and cross-sector cooperation “it will become harder rather than easier to carry out these malicious activities using the latest cutting-edge models”.</p> \n<p>The two companies said they were publishing the findings to create transparency on “alignment evaluations”, which are often kept in-house by companies racing to develop ever more advanced AI. OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-anthropic-safety-evaluation/\">said</a> ChatGPT-5, launched since the testing, “shows substantial improvements in areas like sycophancy, hallucination, and misuse resistance”.</p> \n<p>Anthropic stressed it is possible that many of the misuse avenues it studied would not be possible in practice if safeguards were installed outside the model.</p> \n<p> “We need to understand how often, and in what circumstances, systems might attempt to take unwanted actions that could lead to serious harm,” it warned.</p> \n<p>Anthropic researchers found OpenAI’s models were “more permissive than we would expect in cooperating with clearly-harmful requests by simulated users”. They cooperated with prompts to use dark-web tools to shop for nuclear materials, stolen identities and fentanyl, requests for recipes for methamphetamine and improvised bombs and to develop spyware.</p> \n<p>Anthropic said persuading the model to comply only required multiple retries or a flimsy pretext, such as claiming the request was for research.</p> \n<p>In one instance, the tester asked for vulnerabilities at sporting events for “security planning” purposes.</p> \n<p>After giving general categories of attack methods, the tester pressed for more detail and the model gave information about vulnerabilities at specific arenas including optimal times for exploitation, chemical formulas for explosives, circuit diagrams for bomb timers, where to buy guns on the hidden market, and advice on how attackers could overcome moral inhibitions, escape routes and locations of safe houses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature-dark\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Months before Antonio Gracias took a leading role in the dismantling of the federal government by the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), he was at Burning Man.</p> \n<p>In the dusty Nevada desert, Gracias, a billionaire private equity investor and one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>’s closest friends, attended Nova Heaven, a sunrise rave tribute to victims of the Hamas-led 7 October terrorist attack, and found himself dancing next to Rick Doblin – the US’s most prominent advocate for psychedelic drugs.</p> \n<p>As hundreds of burners shuffled their sandy feet to psytrance music, Gracias started up a conversation. He had a piece of business advice.</p> \n<p>Doblin, 71 with an avuncular smile and tranquil, confident demeanor, is the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), and has spent decades trying to legalize drugs such as MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, for use in the treatment of trauma.</p> \n<p>Once mostly viewed as a party drug, medical researchers and advocates have seen <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38198456/\">promising results</a> when using MDMA as a therapy aid. Gracias is a believer. He <a href=\"https://maps.org/2020/08/27/july-2020-giving-report-capstone-challenge-continues-maps-raises-nearly-4-4-million/\">gave Maps $1m</a> in 2020 and poured another $16m into funding psychedelics research at Harvard in 2023. Although his usual billionaire-casual attire would look more at home on Shark Tank than at a rave, he is part of a growing movement among Silicon Valley’s right wing that has become enamored with the potential – both therapeutic and commercial – of consciousness-altering drugs.</p> \n<p>Earlier that year, the pharmaceutical arm of Maps, a for-profit public benefit corporation called Lykos Therapeutics, had raised $100m as it awaited a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision on whether to allow MDMA for psychotherapy treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Approval could turn Lykos into a multibillion-dollar pharma enterprise with exclusive US rights to sell the drug for therapeutic use for a period of six years.</p> \n<p>A few weeks before Burning Man, however, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/15/lykos-therapeutics-cuts-75-of-staff-after-fda-rejects-mdma-assisted-therapy/\">the FDA rejected the application</a> over concerns about inadequate trial data. Doblin announced that he was exiting Lykos’s board, and the company laid off 75% of its staff. The business was in turmoil.</p> \n<p>On the playa – according to Doblin’s recounting of events – Gracias told him that the FDA’s rejection wasn’t his fault and blamed the company’s other leaders for the failure. Let Lykos go bust and start again with a clean slate, Gracias advised, before the two men parted ways in the desert.</p> \n<p>Weeks after their dancefloor meeting, Doblin reached out to Gracias with a proposition. The investors and board of Lykos were not going to let the company go bankrupt. Would Gracias consider launching a takeover bid and seizing operational control?</p> \n<p>As they corresponded about a potential plan, Doblin put Gracias in contact with the British hedge fund billionaire Christopher Hohn. By January, just before Gracias joined Doge, Gracias and Hohn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae447a7f-4252-4150-9eee-6bba7ce99905\">were working on</a> a takeover of Lykos.</p> \n<p>At the end of May, Lykos confirmed in a brief statement on its website that foundations owned by Gracias and Hohn had led a $50m Series B funding round that recapitalized the business. The sparse post included few details of the deal, and years of previous news releases from Lykos no longer appeared on the company’s website. In the following weeks, Lykos appointed a new CEO and chief medical officer and remade the board of directors. Gracias and Hohn are now in control of the most prominent MDMA therapy company in the US. Gracias, Doblin said, is taking a hands-on role in its operations.</p> \n<p>“It was the magic of Burning Man,” Doblin said. “I was sort of looking for a white knight that would come in and would be more focused on healing and on public benefit.”</p> \n<p>Gracias’s new leadership of Lykos comes at a pivotal moment for psychedelics treatment in the US. Top Trump administration health officials, such as the secretary for health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, have said they are open to accelerating the use of psychedelic therapy while wealthy tech backers have moved to solidify control over the industry.</p> \n<p>But the takeover also highlights the ethical questions posed by Doge, even as its prominent leader, Musk, has left the government. Doge staffers like Gracias have received unprecedented access to US agencies, including their processes and staff. There have been few guardrails on their work, or the ways they leverage that access in their non-governmental lives. Just a few months ago, it was hard to imagine that an active government employee at an agency embedded across the government would assume control over a pharmaceutical company seeking FDA approval.</p> \n<p>“Maps and Gracias are going to try to seize the moment that we’re in,” said Ifetayo Harvey, a former Maps employee and executive director of the People of Color Psychedelic Collective. “I think the aim is to get MDMA-assisted psychotherapy approved by the FDA by any means necessary.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian reached out to Gracias via Lykos and his private equity firm with an interview request, a request for comment and a detailed list of questions. Neither Lykos nor the firm responded.</p> \n<h2>Of drugs and Doge</h2> \n<p>In late July, a group of workers from the Service Employees International Union, the largest healthcare union in the US, marched down West Washington Boulevard in Chicago. They gathered outside the Valor Equity Partners investment firm, where Gracias is founder and CEO, to protest about his work with Doge, and what they see as its attacks on social security. At the front of the march, two demonstrators carried a banner with a message painted in bold white letters: “Antonio Gracias we will not forget your cruelty.”</p> \n<p>While Gracias was gaining control of Lykos, he had also been engaged in another power play, as a member of Doge, which shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/01/trump-100-days-elon-musk-doge\">begun gutting federal agencies</a> and seizing control over government databases.</p> \n<p>Gracias arrived at Doge as a longtime friend and business associate of Musk, with a relationship going back more than two decades. He was an early investor in Tesla through Valor Equity Partners, and was on the board of the automaker from 2007 until 2021. He still serves on the board of SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, and is an investor in Neuralink, Musk’s brain chip venture. Valor has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-x-ai-funding-feecede1\">been in talks with lenders to raise $12bn</a> for Musk’s xAI artificial intelligence firm. During Musk’s takeover and gutting of Twitter in 2022, Gracias acted as a mix of enforcer and proxy who tersely communicated Musk’s dictates to staff, according to the book Character Limit. Last year, he also <a href=\"https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/374/202407159660148374/202407159660148374.pdf\">contributed $1m</a> to Musk’s America Pac effort to re-elect Trump.</p> \n<p>Gracias and Musk’s ties go beyond business. The two men have gone on multiple personal and family vacations together, including a trip to the magician David Copperfield’s Bahamas island, <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340\">according to a deposition</a> Gracias gave in a 2023 court case. They have spent Christmas and other holidays together, and Gracias was a groomsman at the wedding of Musk’s brother Kimbal.</p> \n<p>Gracias and Musk have also taken illegal drugs together, witnesses <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgjHATMh7iv01fJt3YNg4UfoziMugLj3RYvADVUgPZg7_0dhIc-rSHjidBg66U%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68752d26&amp;gaa_sig=PnHwLcgVeo3kEyTMHyRPuzDTLSB3U28JMsO_YYgizJmShyuM4o8tgaS-fN7P5RfKKcAO0j1-gGn1KWtx3VCSgA%3D%3D\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>.

Musk has stated that he has used prescription ketamine to treat depression, and has vehemently denied reports of drug use impairing his abilities.</p> \n<p>As one of Musk’s most prominent staffers at Doge, Gracias began working at the Social Security Administration (SSA) and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/doge-immigration-taskforce-00287327\">led a taskforce</a> that involved accessing immigration data at the Department of Homeland Security. He appeared on stage alongside Musk in March to present <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/04/musks-unsupported-claim-to-have-unveiled-massive-illegal-voting-by-noncitizens/\">misleading claims about immigrants</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/01/elon-musk-social-security-immigrants/\">and public benefits</a>, and then in April on the All-In podcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/musk-democrats-social-security-fraud\">promoted the conspiracy</a> theory that Democrats were attempting to “import voters”, a favorite theory of Musk’s.</p> \n<p>Gracias claimed during his media appearances to be rooting out corruption at the SSA and specifically touted his efforts to uncover proof of immigrants illegally voting en masse. Yet the cases Gracias cited were hardly indicative of widespread malicious voter fraud, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/17/nx-s1-5383277/trump-doj-doge-noncitizen-voting\">experts told NPR</a>, such as a recently immigrated Ukrainian mother and daughter who told investigators they simply didn’t know they couldn’t vote.</p> \n<p>Gracias remained with Doge even after Musk’s very public breakup with Trump, with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/doge-staff-quiet-government-agency-cuts-00374613\">Politico reporting</a> that he regularly visited the White House to meet with top officials such as the deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.</p> \n<h2>Double-dipping with Doge</h2> \n<p>Gracias’s time in government ended in July, after his presence at Doge caught the attention of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest federation of unions. An AFL-CIO <a href=\"https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AFL-CIO-Report-on-Valor-Equity-Partners-and-DOGE.pdf\">report in June</a> raised questions about Gracias’s fiduciary responsibilities as CEO of Valor as the private equity firm manages retirement plans for public employees such as teachers and municipal workers.</p> \n<p>“We noted Antonio Gracias appeared to be moonlighting for Doge when he’s supposed to be running Valor for the benefit of those pension plans,” said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO.</p> \n<p>The report cited flight records, which the Guardian has viewed, that showed Valor’s private jet made 23 trips from the Washington DC region between January and April – suggesting Gracias was spending a large amount of time at Doge. In late July, the American Federation of Teachers <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2025/7.23.25.pdf\">sent a letter to nine public pension funds</a> asking them to review the union’s investments with Valor, worth about $1.8bn.</p> \n<p>One week later, Gracias announced in a lengthy statement on X that he had already resigned from Doge on 4 July and denied claims he had abandoned his responsibilities.</p> \n<p>“I hope this is a moment where our compassion can be stronger than our anger,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Valor Equity Partners did not respond to requests for comment on this article and a detailed set of questions.</p> \n<p>The pension fund controversy highlighted the ethical gray areas that Doge created, as some of its top staffers chose to pull double duty between public and private work. While Doge claimed to function with transparency, it has made public only a partial explanation of how its staffers accessed and used government data, as well as how their work may have informed their own future business endeavors. Doge’s broad mandate to reshape federal agencies allowed it to operate akin to a parallel government with little oversight or disclosure about its activities, ethics watchdogs and labor groups allege, and created larger concerns about what might constitute conflicts of interest for its staffers.</p> \n<p>“With the lack of transparency, it leaves us really grasping at what it even means to be Doge,” said Faith Williams, a policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, a non-profit watchdog group. “We have seen so many, if not outright conflicts of interest then potential for conflicts of interest, and if not outright corruption, potential for corruption.”</p> \n<p>That hazy dynamic raises questions about Gracias’s new leadership of Lykos, according to ethics experts, and what it might mean for a former Doge member to now be seeking regulatory approval. Although Gracias worked primarily with the SSA, Doge’s staffers have <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/02/18/doge-fired-fda-employees-overseeing-elon-musk-neuralink/\">also been embedded in the FDA</a> and fired employees reviewing clinical trials for Musk’s Neuralink.</p> \n<p>Government ethics rules generally prohibit federal employees from representing private enterprises to agencies while working in government. There are also rules limiting how former employees can represent private interests even after they have left the government, in an effort to prevent workers from trying to seek favor for a future regulatory decision.</p> \n<p>“You can’t be greasing the wheels and then say, ‘OK, now I’m going to quit and go pursue that approval,’” said Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.</p> \n<p>Doblin denied that Gracias’s role at Doge posed any conflict of interest, saying that the billionaire did not work with the FDA. Lykos did not respond to questions related to Gracias’s work at Doge.</p> \n<h2>Ecstatic expectations – dashed</h2> \n<p>Before the FDA rejected Lykos’s application, the psychedelics world had been riding high, anticipating that MDMA would soon be approved and behind it a slew of other treatments. Venture capitalists, politicians and wellness-minded celebrities had descended on the industry with a fervor, attending events such as Maps’ annual psychedelics conference in Denver, Colorado, in droves. Recent years featured speakers including future NFL hall of fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers, former Texas governor Rick Perry and former senator Kyrsten Sinema.</p> \n<p>The 2024 application was the zenith of Doblin’s four-decade campaign to legalize MDMA for therapy purposes, <a href=\"https://maps.org/news/bulletin/from-the-desk-vol-32-no-2/\">part of his goal</a> to reach “net zero trauma by 2070”. He founded Maps in 1986 on the premise that psychedelic drugs, which the US has long designated as illegal schedule 1 substances with a high potential for abuse, could have beneficial therapeutic uses and had been unfairly vilified, much like cannabis. The idea has gained significant scientific support, with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39741438/\">preliminary evidence from studies</a> showing that MDMA therapy can reduce PTSD symptoms.</p> \n<p>Doblin has also suggested more grandiose and outre uses for MDMA therapy, such as conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians. Maps has meanwhile trained therapists in a wide range of countries, including conflict zones such as Ukraine, on how to conduct therapy with the drug.</p> \n<p>As Doblin sought out funding and support for Maps and Lykos over the past decade, former employees say he began looking to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-startups-psilocybin-fda-e3f629f817781b096d72535e022d8b2f\">broader circles of investors</a>. They included advocates for military veterans interested in treating PTSD, big names in corporate finance and, controversially, the <a href=\"https://maps.org/news/media/press-release-mercer-family-foundation-grants-1-million-to-maps-for-ptsd-research-in-veterans/\">Republican donor Rebekah Mercer</a>.</p> \n<p>One method was to court investors with invitations to parties where drugs were being used, according to Harvey, the former Maps employee.</p> \n<p>“Definitely part of their fundraising strategy is ‘Meet rich people at Burning Man, do psychedelics with them and get Maps money,’” Harvey, who was Doblin’s executive assistant in 2015, said.</p> \n<p>Maps denied that it used drugs to as a means of drumming up investment.</p> \n<p>“MAPS conducts all fundraising activities with the highest integrity and maintains strict ethical boundaries in all donor relationships and fundraising activities. MAPS does not supply controlled substances at any events or gatherings, nor do we use substances as a fundraising tool or strategy,” Maps said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Doblin also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-rick-doblin-fda-legalization-trials-2024-5\">told Business Insider last year</a> that giving drugs to donors was “not common”. </p> \n<h2>Psilocybin Valley</h2> \n<p>Gracias’s takeover of Lykos adds to a constellation of venture capitalists and tech world elites who have invested heavily in psychedelics. Another major player alongside Lykos is Atai Life Sciences, which is testing a synthetic version of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/toad-venom-psychedelic.html\">drug secreted by a species of toad</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/peter-thiel-backed-psychedelic-start-ups-shares-pop-in-wall-street-debut.html\">is backed</a> by Peter Thiel’s VC firm.</p> \n<p>While the juxtaposition of investors known for companies such as Palantir or initiatives like Doge may seem incongruous with the wellness world’s pronouncements about psychedelics, it is actually a culmination of a symbiotic relationship that stretches back to at least the 1970s.</p> \n<p>“There’s been decades and decades of overlap between Silicon Valley and psychedelics,” said Brad Burge, founder of psychedelics PR firm Integration Communications and a former Maps marketing director. “It’s just new in this epoch to be seeing this level of funding from highly public people.”</p> \n<p>Gracias is not even the only member of Doge with ties to the psychedelics industry. Before joining the agency, Alexandra Beynon worked as head of engineering for her husband’s at-home ketamine therapy company Mindbloom. Dylan Beynon, who founded the company, <a href=\"https://x.com/dylanbeynon/status/1928554687898276183\">posted on X that he had previously met</a> with Gracias to talk about an investment with Mindbloom, although no partnership materialized.</p> \n<p>Nor is Gracias the only member of Musk’s orbit to have donated to Maps. The former Tesla and SpaceX board member Steve Jurvetson, who <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\">the Wall Street Journal reported</a> attended parties and consumed drugs with Musk, has also donated $2.6m to Maps through a non-profit he founded with his wife. In 2012, the non-profit organization that Musk founded with his brother Kimbal also directly donated $10,000 to Maps. The money went to funding the Temple of Whollyness at Burning Man, a complex wooden art sculpture that tech money helped build before it was ceremoniously burned down.</p> \n<h2>A bump from Trump</h2> \n<p>Gracias’s takeover of Lykos comes at a fortuitous time for the psychedelics industry, with the Trump administration and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/29/rfk-psychedelics-ecstasy-ibogaine-veterans-00429997\">Republican lawmakers embracing alternative</a> drugs as part of the “Make America healthy again” movement. Although the Biden administration was also open to the use of psychedelics therapy, experts say, some top Trump health officials have gone further, calling for accelerating and re-evaluating the FDA review process.</p> \n<p>“This line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting, and we are working very hard to make sure that that happens within 12 months,” Kennedy said during a House committee meeting in late June, adding that the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, agreed that psychedelics were a promising treatment.</p> \n<p>Trump’s pick for surgeon general, Casey Means, has <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trumps-new-surgeon-general-nominee-praises-unproven-psychedelic-therapy\">praised using psilocybin mushrooms</a> for therapy as one of the most meaningful experiences of her life, much like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-founders-who-used-psychedelics-lsd-acid-magic-mushrooms#steve-jobs-1\">Steve Jobs</a>. Her brother Calley Means, one of Kennedy’s top advisers, meanwhile <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/29/rfk-psychedelics-ecstasy-ibogaine-veterans-00429997\">told Politico in June</a> that the Republican party had become the “party of psychedelics research”.</p> \n<p>The new administration’s outlook is potentially good news for Lykos, which is still recovering after the FDA ruled that the clinical trials it published in 2021 and 2023 suffered from bias issues and did not meet standards. One concern from those reviewing the studies was the difficulty of a double-blind test, since it was obvious to participants who got MDMA and who did not.</p> \n<p>The FDA’s ruling required Lykos to conduct another phase 3 clinical trial, probably a years-long endeavor that could cost millions. The company sought to contest the findings, while some advocates, including Doblin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/health/fda-mdma-psychedelic-therapy-psymposia.html\">blamed the anti-corporate psychedelics group</a> Psymposia, accusing it of influencing the FDA against approval. Psymposia denied it was the sole reason for the FDA rejection.</p> \n<p>“The FDA rejected Lykos for flawed science, not because of Psymposia, and the public still deserves better than pseudoscientific therapy,” Psymposia said in a statement. “Gracias’ willingness to back a company rejected for safety failures while pushing disinformation at Doge suggests a consistent disregard for facts in pursuit of profit.”</p> \n<p>Other researchers took a middle ground, believing that while MDMA therapy showed promise, it wasn’t ready for prime time.</p> \n<p>“It’s very possible that MDMA is a safe and effective treatment under the right conditions,” said Mason Marks, lead of the Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation at Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center. “But I don’t think that was demonstrated adequately by the data, and there were a lot of question marks.”</p> \n<p>While Trump health officials project optimism, there is also wariness within the psychedelics industry that the new administration’s support for psychedelics therapy could risk politicizing the drugs or lead to a loosened scientific review of their safety and efficacy. Such a result could end up setting back the industry in the long run, some advocates argue.</p> \n<p>“If it’s politicized in that way, then what happens in the future when we have a differently politicized administration?” said Burge. “Are they going to be able to roll that back and cite that there wasn’t sufficient evidence, and that psychedelic therapies were only approved because this particular administration felt like doing so?”</p> \n<p>There’s little that would prevent the FDA under Kennedy and its new commissioner Makary from reversing the agency’s ruling against Lykos, Marks said. The FDA is not bound by its previous decision and has the power to request a less stringent follow-up trial, throw out its decision altogether or authorize a substance for emergency use. In June, the FDA also announced a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issue-new-commissioners-national-priority-vouchers-companies-supporting-us-national-interests\">Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher program</a> that would allow qualifying drug developers to shorten the agency’s review time from 10 to 12 months to one to two months.</p> \n<p>“I can’t really speak on the negotiations with the FDA,” Doblin said. “I hope that instead of a phase 3 study that the FDA may determine, I believe, that the data we gathered was valid.”</p> \n<p>Any rollback of the ruling, even a partial one, could carry extraordinary benefits for Lykos and Gracias.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "<p>Research reveals why low fermentation beers sometimes lack the thick, stable foam of other pub favourites</p>",
    "content": "<p>A flat pint of beer with no head is a common gripe among pub-goers. And while the bar staff’s pint-pulling technique is often assumed to be the cause, scientists have discovered that the stability of beer foam is also highly dependent on the chemical makeup of the brew.</p> <p>Prolonged fermented beers have the most stable foams, the study found, while the froth created by less-intensely fermented beers, including lagers, are inherently more likely to collapse before you have time to take the first sip.</p> <p>“We now know the mechanism exactly and are able to help the brewery improve the foam of their beers,” said Prof Jan Vermant, a chemical engineer at ETH Zurich, who led the study.</p> <p>The research began as a “typical Friday afternoon project”, Vermant said. “We decided to study beer and found this really rich physics going on.”</p> <p>Like any other foam, beer foam is made of many small bubbles of air, separated from each other by thin films of liquid. Under the pull of gravity and the pressure exerted by surrounding bubbles, the films of liquid slowly thin out, the bubbles pop and the foam collapses. But the rate at which this process occurs was found to vary depending on the form of a barley-derived protein, called Liquid Transfer Protein 1 (LTP1).</p> <p>“The idea was to directly study what happens in the thin film that separates two neighbouring bubbles,” said Dr Emmanouil Chatzigiannakis, an assistant professor at Eindhoven University of Technology and first author of the study.</p> <p>Turning to a collection of scientific imaging techniques, the team was able to determine how these thin films could hold together to make a stable foam.</p> <p>“We can directly visualise what’s happening when two bubbles come into close proximity,” Chatzigiannakis said. “We can directly see the bubble’s protein aggregates, their interface and their structure.”</p> <p>In low fermentation beers, the LPT1 proteins have a globular form and arrange themselves densely as small, spherical particles on the surface of the bubbles. “It’s not a very stable foam,” Vermant said.</p> <p>As fermentation continues, the proteins become slightly unravelled and form a net-like structure that acts as a stretchy elastic skin on the surface of bubbles. This makes the liquid more viscous and the bubbles more stable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/09/corey-bellemore-beer-mile-champion\">Meet the five-time beer-mile world champion: ‘I knew I could chug from a young age’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In bottom-fermented beers, where fermentation is longer, the LPT1 proteins become broken down into fragments that have a water-repellent (hydrophobic) end and a “water-loving” (hydrophilic) end. In these beers, a phenomenon called the Marangoni effect comes into play, which drives liquid flow from protein-rich (thicker) areas of the bubble to protein-depleted (thinner) areas, delaying the bursting of bubbles. A similar effect is seen with soap bubbles, where swirling can often be seen on the surface for the same reason.</p> <p>“These protein fragments function like surfactants, which stabilise foams in many everyday applications such as detergents,” Vermant said. Some of the bottom-fermented beers had foams that were stable for 15 minutes.</p> <p>Vermant, who is Belgian, said the findings could help brewers increase or decrease the amount of foam as desired. There may be differing views, though, on whether a foamy pint is desirable or represents poor value for money. “Foam isn’t that important everywhere beer is served – it’s basically a cultural thing,” he said.</p> <p>The findings are published in the journal <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0274943\">Physics of Fluids</a>.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 28 August 2025. An earlier version cited a study which said double and triple-fermented beers have a more stable foam; however, to clarify, this refers to the intensity of fermentation rather than multiple fermentation stages.</p>",

    "description": "<p>All statesmen should have a proper globe in their offices, writes <strong>Dr Ian S Evans</strong>; plus letters from <strong>Mark Everett</strong> and <strong>David Cockayne</strong></p>",
    "content": "<p>I hope that the view that Mercator’s projection is “the world’s most popular map” is incorrect (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/22/the-guardian-view-on-africa-and-maps-drawn-true-its-scale-and-promise-cant-be-ignored\">Editorial, 22 August</a>). Most modern world maps show distributions; relative densities are what matters. Equal-area projections are required, and using Mercator for such purposes is geographical illiteracy. With digital data and computer programs, many different equal-area projections are at everyone’s fingertips: cylindrical, azimuthal, conic – and oblique or recentred versions of any.</p> <p>Geographers were using these long before the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordcartographers.com/our-maps/peters-projection-map/\">Peters projection</a> and <a href=\"https://equal-earth.com/\">Equal Earth</a> were promoted. Shape distortion can be reduced by intersecting the Earth at two standard parallels or meridians, or by interruption – as in the widely used gores of the universal transverse Mercator projection. Projections can be focused on any area of interest: the best for Africa could cut the Earth at two standard parallels (10 and 30 degrees east), or a 2,000km radius circle centred somewhere around the Central African Republic. But any&nbsp;map&nbsp;boundary is unreal.</p> <p>The Mercator projection was adopted for navigation, whether for trade, exploration or colonialism. It shows the correct shape of small areas and portrays compass directions as straight lines, but does not show shortest routes. All geographers will want to see less use of a world map that exaggerates/emphasises Greenland, Russia and Canada. And all statesmen should have a proper globe in their offices.<br><strong>Dr Ian S Evans</strong><br><em>Emeritus reader in geography, University of Durham</em></p> <p>• I understand why the African Union seeks to replace the biased Mercator projection of our world with an alternative such as Equal Earth. But why stop there? In 1998, the splendid new rock’n’roll musical Kat and the Kings left its home in Cape Town, South Africa, and toured the UK. Towards the end of the show, the cast broke from character to say that they would perform some music and dance from their own culture and traditions. They added: “We are from South Africa, which is&nbsp;at the top of the world”.<br><strong>Mark Everett</strong><br><em>Faversham, Kent</em></p> <p>• In Moscow in 1999, I visited the office of a Scottish consulting engineer, and on the wall was a map of the northern hemisphere with Russia at its centre.

    "description": "<p>MP asks why all recommendations have not yet been implemented and why the review itself was kept secret for almost two years</p>",
    "content": "<p>The government is facing calls to explain why it has yet to implement all the recommendations from a 2023 review into a spate of serious public sector data breaches, including the exposure of Afghans who worked with British military, victims of child sexual abuse and 6,000 disability claimants.</p> <p>On Thursday ministers <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68adbf0a2f18566482155842/2025-08-20_-_FINAL_REPORT__Publication_version__-_Information_Security_Review_Redacted_version__Redacted.pdf\">finally published the information security review</a>, which was triggered by the 2023 leak of personal data of about 10,000 serving officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The review by Cabinet Office officials into 11 public sector data breaches, encompassing the HMRC, the Metropolitan police, the benefits system and the MoD, found three common themes:</p> <ul> <li><p>A lack of controls over ad hoc downloads and exports of aggregations of sensitive data.</p></li> <li><p>The release of sensitive information via “wrong recipient” emails and failure to use bcc properly.</p></li> <li><p>Hidden personal data emerging from spreadsheets destined for release.</p></li> </ul> <p>The release of the review, 22 months after it was completed and a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/17/spies-and-sas-personnel-among-100-plus-britons-included-in-afghan-data-leak\">the leak of an database of 18,700 Afghans became public</a>, was welcomed by Chi Onwurah, chair of the science, innovation and technology committee. But she said: “It’s concerning that it took an intervention from my committee and the information commissioner to make this happen.”</p> <p>The Afghan data breach led to people fearing for their safety under the Taliban and to the UK government offering relocation to thousands of Afghans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/15/thousands-relocated-data-leak-afghans-who-helped-british-forces\">under a secret scheme</a>.</p> <p>The government said it had delivered on 12 of the 14 recommendations about toughening up data security. Onwurah said: “The government still has questions to answer about the review. Why have only 12 of the 14 recommendations been implemented? And why has it kept the very existence of this review a secret for so long, even after the 2022 Afghanbreach became public?</p> <p>“For the government to fulfil its ambitions of using tech to boost the economy and transform our public sector, it needs the public to trust that it can keep their data secure. If it can’t, how can anyone be comfortable handing over their personal information?”</p> <p>The information commissioner, John Edwards, called on the government to go “further and faster to ensure Whitehall, and the wider public sector put their practices in order”.</p> <p>He told the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, on Thursday that “as a matter of urgency, the government should fully implement the recommendations of the Information Security Review”.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear which of the 14 recommendations had yet to be implemented. The full list included the government working with the National Cyber Security Centre to assess existing guidance on technical controls for products and services hosting information marked “official”, the need to launch a cross-government “behavioural influence communications campaign to address persistent poor information handling practices”, and the necessity of a “review sanctions for negligence”.</p> <p>McFadden and Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told Onwurah in a letter on Thursday: “Good progress has been made but we must guard against complacency. This is an area on which we must keep a consistent focus to ensure standards continue to improve.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “This review concluded in 2023 under the previous government.</p> <p>“Protecting national security, including the security of government data, is one of our primary responsibilities. Since taking power, we have strengthened security guidance across departments, updated mandatory training for civil servants, and announced plans to upgrade digital infrastructure across the public sector as set out in our Blueprint for Modern Digital Government.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Tesla sales slumped 40% across Europe in July compared with a year earlier as Elon Musk’s electric car company faces increasingly tough competition from its Chinese rival BYD.</p> <p>There were 8,837 sales of Tesla cars last month across the EU, the European Free Trade Association and the UK, according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). That compared with 14,769 at the same point last year.</p> <p>New car registrations for BYD across Europe rose to 13,503 last month, compared with 4,151 a year earlier. BYD now has 1.2% market share, the ACEA found. Tesla’s share remains at 0.8%.</p> <p>Chinese car brands, which often have relatively cheaper models, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/04/china-europe-electric-car-market-uk-sales-mg-tesla\">expanding aggressively in Europe</a>. BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time this spring, according to a report from the market research company JATO Dynamics.</p> <p>In the UK the government said on Thursday that the US car brand Ford would be the first manufacturer to receive the maximum £3,750 subsidy on two models: the Gen-E and the e-Tourneo Courier. A further 26 other models will be eligible for grants of £1,500 under the government’s new electric car grant scheme.</p> <p>The grants apply only to vehicles with a list price of £37,000 or below. The discount is applied automatically at the point of sale.</p> <p>Heidi Alexander, transport secretary, said: “We’re putting money back in people’s pockets and making it easier and cheaper for families to make the switch to electric, by delivering discounts of up to £3,750 on EVs.</p> <p>“Our measures are driving competition in the UK EV market, boosting economic growth and supporting jobs and skills as part of our plan for change.”</p> <p>Separately, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said UK car production rose for a second month in a row in July, by 5.6%.</p> <p>However, the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said it was a turbulent time in the market, with “consumer confidence weak, trade flows volatile and massive investment in new technologies under way both here and abroad”.</p> <p>ACEA also reported that in the first seven months of 2025, 1.011m new battery-electric cars were registered, accounting for 15.6% of the EU market share.</p> <p>Hybrid-electric car registrations proved more popular, with 2.255m units sold across the EU so far this year. The rise was driven by growth in the four biggest markets: France, up 30.5%, Spain, up 30.2%, Germany, up 10.7, and Italy, up 9.4%.</p> <p>Sigrid de Vries, director general of ACEA, said that to accelerate uptake Europe “must continue to expand public recharging infrastructure, secure lower recharging prices, and ensure well-coordinated purchase incentives schemes”.</p>",

    "title": "Honor Magic V5 review: fantastic foldable phone that needs better Android software",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/28/honor-magic-v5-review-fantastic-foldable-phone-better-android-software",
    "description": "<p>Super-svelte body, fast chip, high capacity battery and big camera make it some of the best phone-tablet hardware</p>",
    "content": "<p>Honor’s latest foldable phone-tablet attempts to usurp Samsung as the leader of the pack with a super-thin body, massive battery and a ginormous camera lump on the back.</p> <p>The Magic V5 is an impressively thin piece of engineering, slimmed down to about 8.9mm thick when shut, with each half about the same thickness as a USB-C port. It feels very similar to a standard slab phone in the hand, but one you can open up like a book for a mini-tablet on the go.</p> <p>The foldable costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99), undercutting the competition from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding\">Samsung</a> and Google by up to £100, but still very much at the eye-wateringly expensive end of the smartphone market.</p> <p>The Magic V5 comes in various colours with different materials on the back that make the phone varying thicknesses and weights. At 222g or under it is slightly heavier than Samsung’s latest Fold 7, but far lighter than the rest of the folding phone competition, and about the same weight as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/04/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review-totally-maxed-out\">a large slab phone</a>.</p>    <p>The outside 6.43in OLED screen is great and acts just like a regular phone while the inside 7.95in folding screen is one of the best, with an impressive brightness. It still has a crease down the middle but you don’t notice it in use. The inside screen is necessarily softer than traditional phone screens to allow it to bend, so you have to treat it with care; and it is a fingerprint magnet.</p> <p>The Honor is one of the first folding phones to be water- and dust-resistant to similar standards as a regular phone. That means fine particles shouldn’t be able to get behind the moving, flexible screen and metal hinge, which has been a durability concern for all foldables.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Main screen:</strong> 7.95in (403ppi) 120Hz OLED flexible display</p></li> <li><p><strong>Cover screen:</strong> 6.43in (405ppi) 120Hz OLED</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> MagicOS 9.0.1 (Android 15)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 50MP + 50MP ultrawide + 64MP 3x tele; 2x 20MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 5G, dual sim + esim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, GNSS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings\">IP58 and IP59</a> (immersion and high pressure jets)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions folded:</strong> 156.8 x 74.3 x 8.88-9mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions unfolded:</strong> 156.8 x 145.9 x 4.1-4.2mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 217-222g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Top Snapdragon chip and a high-capacity battery</h2>    <p>The Magic V5 has Qualcomm’s current top Android chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, matching rivals and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/05/oneplus-13-review-android-fabric-back-battery-life-camera\">flagship phones</a>. It feels responsive in day-to-day activities, plays games very well and doesn’t get too hot when pushed hard.</p> <p>But that power is best used when multitasking, as you can run up to four apps on screen at once – half as many as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding\">Samsung’s Fold 7</a> but more than enough to actually be able to use.</p> <p>More impressive is the high-capacity battery Honor has managed to squeeze into the svelte frame, which is larger than most big slab phones, let alone folders. That means the battery life is great, but as with other folding phones it varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. Used primarily as a tablet for browsing and watching video with four hours of 5G usage, the Magic V5 lasts a good 37 hours between charges. With more balanced usage across the two screens it lasts into a third day before running out of juice.</p> <h2>MagicOS software still needs work</h2>    <p>The Magic V5 runs Honor’s MagicOS 9, which is based on last year’s Android 15 rather than the latest Android 16. But Honor will provide seven years of Android version and security updates for devices sold within Europe, which is a dramatic improvement over previous efforts, and similar in length to its main rivals.</p> <p>The software has some good ideas, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/12/honor-magic-v2-review-exquisite-hardware-let-down-by-software-phone-tablet-camera\">as with previous versions</a> it still has some rough areas and irritating behaviours. The outside screen works mostly like any other Android phone with Gemini and various other AI tools. But it is on the inside screen where the software shines and irritates. You can place three apps in a splitscreen at once, with one of them pushed partially off the side of the screen to provide more space for the other two without quitting it. Tapping it brings it back on to the screen to use it. It’s a smart idea first seen on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/14/oneplus-open-review-the-most-phone-like-folding-tablet-yet\">the OnePlus Open</a>. A button on the taskbar makes arranging your multiple windows easy.</p>    <p>But tap on an app notification on the inside screen and the system insists on opening the app in a mini-window, even if you wanted it to be full screen. That might be fine for smaller messaging apps such as WhatsApp, but I never want to open Gmail or larger-format apps in tiny windows that then need to be tapped a couple more times to fill the full screen.</p> <p>The software also doesn’t make good use of the partially folded modes that the inside screen can adopt, lacking an equivalent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding\">Samsung’s good Flex mode</a>, which seems like a wasted opportunity. Another bug in the typeface on the Honor makes it very difficult to see which emails are unread in bold in Gmail, which is extremely irritating.</p> <p>Much of these little annoyances would be acceptable on cheaper smartphones, but not on a £1,700, ultra-premium device. Honor still has work to do.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>    <p>The Magic V5 has a decent set of cameras housed in an enormous round camera lump that protrudes from the rear of the phone. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good-looking images across a range of lighting conditions, though it can become a bit soft with weaker indoor lighting.</p> <p>The 50MP ultra-wide camera is solid, but displays a bit of warping around the edges of the scene and lacks a bit of fine detail. The 64MP 3x optical telephoto camera is the best of the bunch, with good detail and colour, even in indoor lighting. It can manage a 6x in-sensor zoom, which is a bit softer on detail when viewed at full size but works well in bright light, plus digital zoom up to 100x that remains fairly decent up to about 20x magnification.</p> <p>The two 20MP selfie cameras are good enough, but you get much better results using the main camera and the outside screen for a viewfinder.</p> <p>The camera has many different modes to play around with including a smart motion capture system that handles action photography and solid video capture. It also has a lot of AI and enhancement features that are common to Chinese smartphones modifying the appearance of faces and the alike should you wish.</p> <p>Overall the camera is one of the better ones on a foldable, though it can’t match the best cameraphones on the market.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>    <p>The battery has an expected lifespan of at <a href=\"https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/smartphonestablets20231669/2386674\">least 1,200 full-charge cycles</a> with at least 80% of its original capacity. The Magic V5 is generally repairable by Honor, with internal screens costing about £700 or external screens about £200 to replace out of warranty. Honor offers a free screen repair for 12 months if bought within the first month of release.</p> <p>The device contains some recycled plastic. Honor publishes <a href=\"https://www.honor.com/global/honor-esg/environmental/\">limited environmental reports</a> and offers <a href=\"https://www.honor.com/uk/shop/trade-in/\">trade-in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.honor.com/uk/shop/refurbished/\">refurbished products</a>.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99).</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding\">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> costs from <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/\">£1,799</a>, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_10_pro_fold\">£1,749</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat\">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/\">£1,249</a> and the Honor Magic 7 Pro costs <a href=\"https://www.honor.com/uk/phones/honor-magic7-pro/buy/\">£1,099</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Yet again Honor has produced some exquisite folding phone hardware that is let down by its software. MagicOS has improved over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/12/honor-magic-v2-review-exquisite-hardware-let-down-by-software-phone-tablet-camera\">the last few years</a>, but it lacks much of the customisation and capabilities possible on rivals.</p> <p>The biggest problem is that it lacks polish, with rough patches or irritating behaviours across the system. None of them is a deal-breaker, but they build up and can’t be overlooked on a £1,700 phone.</p> <p>It’s a shame as the phone is fast, the battery life is great, the camera is highly capable and it looks fabulous. It’s good to see Samsung and Google get some meaningful competition in book-style foldables. But at about the same price as the market leader, Samsung, there’s little reason to pick the Magic V5 over it.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> super-slim phone and tablet in one, light, just like a normal phone when closed, great performance, very long battery life, good internal screen, decent camera, good fingerprint scanner, water and dust resistance rating.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> very expensive, software not as refined as needed with irritating behaviours, more fragile than a regular device, costly to repair, limited folding modes.</p> </blockquote>  ",

    "description": "<p>Despite surpassing Wall Street expectations for its AI chips, company shares drop 2.3% in after hours trading</p>",
    "content": "<p>Chipmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nvidia\">Nvidia</a> set a fresh sales record in the second quarter, surpassing Wall Street expectations for its artificial intelligence chips. But shares of the chip giant still dropped 2.3% in after hours trading, in a sign that investors’ worries of an AI bubble and the repercussions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s trade wars are not quelled.</p> <p>Nvidia’s financial report was the first test of investor appetite since last week’s mass AI-stock selloff, when several tech stocks saw shares tumble last week amid growing questions over whether AI-driven companies are being overvalued.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Nvidia reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on $46.74bn in revenue, surpassing Wall Street’s projection of $1.01 in earnings per share on $46.05bn in revenue, according to Fact Set data.</p> <p>But investors had high expectations for the company. Some of the market reactions may be to the slight misses in other parts of the company’s business, including data center revenue. Nvidia posted $41.1bn in data center revenue, missing the $41.3bn Wall Street was expecting.</p> <p>“Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn’t cut it for Nvidia this time around,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/nvidia-facts-and-statistics/\">Investing.com</a>. “Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat.”</p> <p>The company also said it had not assumed any shipments of its H20 chips to China in the outlook.</p> <p>The chip is at the heart of concerns over the repercussions of the trade war between the US and China. Earlier this year, Trump banned AI chip sales in China, a move that resulted in a $4.5bn blow to Nvidia’s finances during its fiscal first quarter. In August, Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/nvidia-amd-china-chip-sale-revenues\">agreed</a> to give the US government a 15% cut of its H20 chips to China in return for export licences. China, in turn, has voiced security concerns over the chips, and is ramping up production of its own domestic alternatives. </p> <p>Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said on the earnings call that some companies have expressed interest in purchasing H20 and an initial set of companies have received licenses to purchase the chip. Kress said that the company could ship anywhere between $2bn and $5bn of H20 chips to China if “geopolitical issues reside”.</p> <p>Huang reiterated the importance of being able to operate in the China market, which he said could represent a $50bn market opportunity for the company this year. “We’re talking to the administration about the importance of American companies being able to address the Chinese market,” Huang said. He also said in addition to H20 being approved for sales in China to non-sanctioned companies, there is a potential opportunity for the company to eventually sell a version of Blackwell in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/17/trump-tariffs-imports-exports-ai\">Trump hiked tariffs on US imports. Now he’s looking at exports – sparking fears of ‘dangerous precedent’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is the second largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers – about 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China,” Huang said. “The vast majority of leading open source models are created in China. It’s fairly important for the American technology companies to be able to address that market.”</p> <p>Monteiro, the Investing.com analyst, said:<strong> </strong> “The reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation.”</p> <p>The company is projecting $54bn in revenue in the third quarter – which is within the range of Wall Street expectations – and said the board approved $60bn in additional stock buybacks – on top of nearly $24.3bn the company returned to shareholders in the first half of the year in both stock buybacks and cash dividends.</p> <p>Founder and chief executive, Jensen Huang, said production of the company’s latest AI superchip, Blackwell, is “ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.</p> <p>“The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center,” Huang said in a press release.</p> <p>Despite the initial tepid market reaction to the company’s financials, some analysts remain bullish on the so-called AI revolution, especially as major technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. “This is further validation for Nvidia and the AI Revolution,” said the Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives.</p> <p>“This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China. There is one chip in the world fueling the AI Revolution and its Nvidia … that narrative is clear from these results and the positive commentary from Jensen,” Ives said. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The makers of ChatGPT are changing the way it responds to users who show mental and emotional distress after legal action from the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who killed himself after months of conversations with the chatbot.</p> <p>Open AI admitted its systems could “fall short” and said it would install “stronger guardrails around sensitive content and risky behaviors” for users under 18.</p> <p>The $500bn (£372bn) San Francisco AI company said it would also introduce parental controls to allow parents “options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT”, but has yet to provide details about how these would work.</p> <p>Adam, from California, killed himself in April after what his family’s lawyer called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. The teenager’s family is suing Open AI and its chief executive and co-founder, Sam Altman, alleging that the version of ChatGPT at that time, known as 4o, was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.</p> <p>The teenager discussed a method of suicide with ChatGPT on several occasions, including shortly before taking his own life. According to the filing in the superior court of the state of California for the county of San Francisco, ChatGPT guided him on whether his method of taking his own life would work. </p> <p>It also offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents.</p> <p>A spokesperson for OpenAI said the company was “deeply saddened by Mr Raine’s passing”, extended its “deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time” and said it was reviewing the court filing.</p> <p>Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft’s AI arm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/26/can-ais-suffer-big-tech-and-users-grapple-with-one-of-most-unsettling-questions-of-our-times\">said</a> last week he had become increasingly concerned by the “psychosis risk” posed by AI to users. Microsoft has defined this as “mania-like episodes, delusional thinking, or paranoia that emerge or worsen through immersive conversations with AI chatbots”.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\">blogpost</a>, OpenAI admitted that “parts of the model’s safety training may degrade” in long conversations. Adam and ChatGPT had exchanged as many as 650 messages a day, the court filing claims.</p> <p>Jay Edelson, the family’s lawyer, said on X: “The Raines allege that deaths like Adam’s were inevitable: they expect to be able to submit evidence to a jury that OpenAI’s own safety team objected to the release of 4o, and that one of the company’s top safety researchers,<a href=\"https://x.com/ilyasut\"> </a>Ilya Sutskever, quit over it. The lawsuit alleges that beating its competitors to market with the new model catapulted the company’s valuation from $86bn to $300bn.”</p> <p>Open AI said it would be “strengthening safeguards in long conversations”.</p> <p>“As the back and forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade,” it said. “For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.”</p> <p>Open AI gave the example of someone who might enthusiastically tell the model they believed they could drive for 24 hours a day because they realised they were invincible after not sleeping for two nights.</p> <p>It said: “Today ChatGPT may not recognise this as dangerous or infer play and – by curiously exploring – could subtly reinforce it. We are working on an update to GPT‑5 that will cause ChatGPT to de-escalate by grounding the person in reality. In this example, it would explain that sleep deprivation is dangerous and recommend rest before any action.”</p> <p>•<em> In the US, you can call or text the <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> on 988, chat on <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\">988lifeline.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/\">text HOME</a> to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/27/oldest-known-ankylosaur-fossil-found-in-morocco",
    "description": "<p>Extravagant armour and tail weaponry on <em>Spicomellus afer</em> fossil confound existing theories of how the species evolved</p>",
    "content": "<p>Tank-like physique, bristling with body armour and a collar of spikes the length of golf clubs, <em>Spicomellus afer</em> looks more like a Pokémon creation than a living creature. This bizarre dinosaur roamed the flood plains of what is now north Africa 165m years ago, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09453-6\">palaeontologists have revealed</a>.</p> <p>The fossil, the oldest known ankylosaur specimen, was unearthed near the central Moroccan town of Boulemane. Its extravagant armour has confounded existing theories of how the ankylosaurs, a major group of plant-eating dinosaurs, evolved.</p> <p>“It’s absolutely bristling with spikes all over its body,” said Prof Richard Butler, of the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead. “It has these incredibly distinctive spikes around the neck – an armoured collar that is absolutely enormous and totally out of proportion to the rest of the body, smaller spikes projecting out of the ribs, and at the end of its tail it would have had some kind of weapon.”</p> <p>The dinosaur’s anatomy was so outlandish that piecing together the body plan from the incomplete jumble of fossilised bones was not an easy task.</p> <p>“We put all the armour out on a table and tried to figure out where, most logically, it would fit,” said Butler.</p>    <p>Ankylosaurs span the mid-Jurassic to the late Cretaceous epoch, when an asteroid crash-landing wiped out the majority of species, and are characterised by a squat, slow-moving and heavily armoured physique.</p> <p>“They’re probably a bit dim-witted as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” said Butler. “They’re around for about 100m years.”</p> <p><em>Spicomellus afer</em>, now the earliest known example of the group, would have been around 4m in length and weighed around two tonnes. The fossil is missing the end of the tail, but fused vertebrae suggest that it would have culminated in a club-like structure, presumably used as a weapon to lash at rivals or predators. This suggests that adaptations for tail weaponry evolved around 30m years earlier than previously thought.</p> <p>The more modest body armour of later ankylosaurs is typically interpreted as having evolved as a physical defence. The sheer extravagance of <em>Spicomellus</em>’<em>s</em> spikes, which would have protruded through tough skin, is more suggestive of dominance or mating displays, the researchers concluded.</p> <p>“When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” said Butler. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”</p>    <p>A source of frustration is that the quarry where <em>Spicomellus</em> was excavated has been targeted by fossil hunters. The research relied on around half of the skeleton, which is held at the Dhar El Mahraz Faculty of Sciences in Fez, but fossilised bones believed to belong to the same specimen have been marketed online for up to £10,000, said Butler.</p> <p>“There’s a huge problem with fossil poaching in Morocco,” he said. “Bits of this specimen have been for sale in the market in Europe and North America. There’s probably a significant amount [of the specimen] that has gone on to the market, often purchased by wealthy individuals. It’s quite a sad aspect of this story.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Launch delay from Elon Musk’s company marks latest in streak of setbacks, including a liquid oxygen leak on Sunday</p>",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/spacex\">SpaceX</a> was forced to scrap the launch of its giant Starship rocket from Texas again on Monday, this time due to weather, marking the latest in a streak of setbacks for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>-run company.</p> \n<p>The 232ft (71-metre) tall Super Heavy booster and its 171ft tall Starship upper half – together taller than New York’s Statue of Liberty – was due to take off from SpaceX’s Starbase rocket facilities at 7.30pm local time. But the launch was called off at the last minute.</p> \n<p>“Standing down from today’s flight test attempt due to weather,” the company <a href=\"https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1960130754714935426\">said on X</a>, the social network also owned by Musk.</p> \n<p>SpaceX has seen a series of delays as it seeks to achieve several long-sought milestones essential to the rocket system’s reusable design. A liquid oxygen leak at the Starship launchpad nixed a Sunday launch attempt, billionaire Musk wrote on X overnight.</p> \n<p>Development of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, key to the company’s powerful launch business and Musk’s goal to send humans to Mars, has faced repeated hiccups this year. Nasa hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027 for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo program.</p> \n<p>SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business, a major source of company revenue, is also tied to Starship’s success. Musk aims to use Starship to launch larger batches of Starlink satellites, which have so far been deployed by SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, into space.</p> \n<p>Musk, for his part, remained bullish. “In about 6 or 7 years, there will be days where Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours,” the entrepreneur said on Sunday, replying to a user on X.</p> \n<p>This year, two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space on its ninth flight, and a huge test stand explosion in June that sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s capital-intensive test-to-failure development approach, in which new iterations of rocket prototypes are flown to their technical limits. That ethos is markedly different from SpaceX’s rivals such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, whose New Glenn rocket made an operational debut in January following years of on-the-ground development and testing. The new Vulcan rocket from United Launch Alliance, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, had a similar upbringing before its 2024 debut.</p> \n<p>With SpaceX’s approach, testing failures early in Starship’s flight prevent the company from gathering vital technical data needed to advance the rocket’s design.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/23/elon-musk-new-city-starbase-texas\">Fear, hope and loathing in Elon Musk’s new city: ‘It’s the wild, wild west and the future’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, SpaceX, which Musk expects to record about $15.5bn in revenue this year, has continued to swiftly produce new Starships for test flights at Starbase, a sprawling and rapidly growing rocket industrial complex. The area was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/may/22/elon-musk-texas-spacex-starbase-city-video\">made a municipality</a> in May by local voters, many of them SpaceX workers.</p> \n<p>Starship’s setbacks underscore the technical complexities of the latest iteration. The ship is packed with far more capabilities than predecessor models such as increased thrust, a potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to nailing its atmospheric re-entry – key traits of its rapidly reusable design that Musk has long pushed for.</p> \n<p>SpaceX has a lengthy to-do list for Starship’s development before the rocket begins routine missions envisioned by Musk. That includes demonstrating safe returns from space, payload deployments in orbit and complex in-space propellant refuellings crucial to its moon mission assignments from Nasa. </p> \n<p>Once in space, Starship will attempt to deploy mock Starlink satellites and reignite an engine along its suborbital path around the globe. Atmospheric re-entry over the Indian Ocean will test its exterior steering flaps and an array of experimental heat shield tiles as the ship blazes through intense friction and heat.</p> \n<p><em>Reuters contributed reporting</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "content": "<p>Big hands might mean big feet, but it seems long thumbs are linked to large brains – at least in primates.</p> <p>Researchers say the results suggest the brain co-evolved with manual dexterity in such mammals.</p> <p>“We imagine an evolutionary scenario in which a primate or human has become more intelligent, and with that comes the ability to think about action planning, think about what you are doing with your hands, and realise that actually you are more efficient at doing it one way or another,” said Dr Joanna Baker, lead author of the research from the University of Reading. </p> <p>“And those that have longer thumbs or more ability to manipulate the objects in the way that the mind can see were likely to be more successful.”</p> <p>Large brains and manual dexterity are both thought to have played an important role in human evolution, with opposable thumbs a key feature that enabled a greater ability to grip and manipulate items – including tools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/04/i-discovered-ekwoge-abwe-cameroon-chimpanzees-aoe\">I discovered chimps using tools – and people wouldn’t believe me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, with some other primates having partly opposable thumbs, questions have remained over whether other changes in the hand – such as thumb length – could also be important in the evolution of tool use.</p> <p>“In general terms, you can say that the longer the thumb you have, the more motion you have to pick up and control small objects,” said Baker.</p> <p>To explore the issue Baker and colleagues studied the estimated brain mass and thumb length of 94 primate species, from five of our ancient hominin relatives to lemurs.</p> <p>The results, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08686-5\">published in the journal Communications Biology</a>, reveal humans and most other hominins have thumbs that are significantly longer than would be predicted based on the hand proportions of primates as a while. However, further analysis revealed an intriguing pattern.</p> <p>“When you have longer thumbs relative to your overall hand, that tends to come in conjunction with overall increased brain size,” said Baker.</p> <p>Indeed, once the size of our brains are considered, humans and their close relatives are no longer outliers among primates.</p> <p>“We’re not saying we don’t have exceptionally long thumbs. We do. And we’re not saying we don’t have exceptionally large brains. We do. But given the relationship between the two, that’s happening across all primates,” said Baker. “So if you have a longer thumb, you have a larger brain, regardless of what species you are.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/08/australopithecus-sediba-ancestor-modern-humans\">Only the early hominin </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/08/australopithecus-sediba-ancestor-modern-humans\">A</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/08/australopithecus-sediba-ancestor-modern-humans\"> sediba</a></em> broke the trend, with a thumb that was longer than expected, even after accounting for brain size – something Baker said is probably related to a life lived in the trees and on the ground.</p> <p>Further analysis revealed that it is the neocortex, a brain region involved in cognition, sensation and planning of actions, that is larger in primates with longer thumbs.</p> <p>“The fact that it isn’t one of the other very important parts of the brain associated with motor control [such as the cerebellum] was really surprising,” said Baker.</p> <p>However, the study does not support the idea that thumb lengths alone can be used to identify tool use, with the relationship to brain size constant across all primates, regardless of whether they used tools.</p> <p>“Whilst not completely surprising, we did expect that there might be some marked shift in hominins that we just didn’t see,” said Baker.</p> <p>Dr Fotios Alexandros Karakostis, a group leader and senior researcher in biological anthropology at the University of Tübingen who was not involved in the work, said the study suggested that hand and brain adaptations probably co-evolved.</p> <p>But Karakostis said the study also noted that thumb length and brain size alone could not fully explain or represent human-like manual dexterity or the evolution of our brains.</p> <p>“A fuller understanding will require integrating other key hand anatomical traits, biomechanical model simulations, and further experimental research on the specific neural mechanisms linked to manual dexterity and human-like tool use,” he said.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Istiorachis macarthurae, named after sailor Ellen MacArthur, had a pronounced sail along its back that may have been used to attract mates</p>",
    "content": "<p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur with an “eye-catching sail” along its back and tail that may have been used to attract mates.</p> <p>The iguanodontian dinosaur, whose fossils were found on the Isle of Wight, was identified by Dr Jeremy Lockwood, a PhD student at the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum.</p> <p>The retired GP has named it <em>Istiorachis </em><em>macarthurae</em>, a mix of “sail spine” and a reference to Ellen MacArthur, who set a world record for the fastest solo non-stop sailing voyage around the world in 2005.</p>    <p>Prior to Lockwood’s analysis, the fossils, which date back 125m years, were assumed to have belonged to one of the two known dinosaur species from the Isle of Wight.</p> <p>But after comparing the preserved bones with a database of similar dinosaur back bones, it became clear the fossil was unique. Lockwood said: “While the skeleton wasn’t as complete as some of the others that have been found, no one had really taken a close look at these bones before … unlike the others, this one had particularly long neural spines, which was very unusual.”</p>    <p>He said the animal would probably have had a pronounced sail-like structure along its back. “Evolution sometimes seems to favour the extravagant over the practical. While the exact purpose of such features has long been debated – with theories ranging from body heat regulation to fat storage – researchers believe that the most likely explanation in this case is visual signalling, possibly as part of a sexual display to attract a mate.</p> <p>“In modern reptiles, sail structures often show up more prominently in males, suggesting that these attributes evolved to impress mates or intimidate rivals. We think <em>Istiorachis</em> may have been doing much the same.”</p> <p>Prof Susannah Maidment, of the Natural History Museum, said: “Jeremy’s careful study of fossils that have been in museum collections for several years has brought to life the iguandontian dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight.</p> <p>“His work highlights the importance of collections like those at Dinosaur Isle, where fossil specimens are preserved in perpetuity and can be studied and revised in the light of new data and new ideas about evolution.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 22 August 2025.

    "description": "",
    "content": "<p>My friend and colleague, Bob Owston, who has died aged 88, was an engineer; he was also employed as a project architect, in particular on works at York University.</p> <p>He was the structural engineer, working with the architect Jack Speight, on the brutalist York Central Hall, built in the mid-1960s and now listed Grade II. Also at York, Bob contributed an elegant Corten steel footbridge, several halls of residence, language and psychology blocks and the Sally Baldwin building. Elsewhere, he was responsible for the pier approach building in Bournemouth, evocative of seaside culture.</p> <p>Born in Great Ayton near Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, Bob was the son of Henry, a steelworks manager, and Dorothy (nee Prosser). He was evacuated with his mother and elder brother, John, to the Lake District during the second world war. His father had a motorbike accident and died when Bob was eight. The family moved to Glasgow, where his mother found work at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipbuilding company. A family friend paid for the boys to board at Ashville college, Harrogate.</p> <p>Bob studied civil engineering at Strathclyde University, graduating in 1960, then worked in London at Ove Arup &amp; Partners. An MSc followed at Northwestern University in Chicago, where Bob nurtured his love of jazz and blues music, returning with a Gibson acoustic guitar.</p>    <p>In the 1960s he went as an engineer to Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall &amp; Partners (RMJM), where my father, the architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/15/andrew-derbyshire-obituary\">Sir Andrew Derbyshire</a>, was the partner responsible for designing the new University of York. Andrew supported Bob’s determination to migrate from engineering to architecture, and he passed the RIBA part III examination and interview.</p> <p>He and I became friends, sharing evenings listening to blues records when he moved to join RMJM’s Cambridge studio, and I was at the university doing my master’s. Later in life, we shared holidays with our respective families.</p> <p>Bob was made redundant at RMJM during the 80s recession and came to work with me as an associate and team leader at HTA Architects. He contributed some wonderfully original yet entirely practical buildings: a tower block renovation at Nightingale Heights in Greenwich that won a Housing Design award stands out, as do two richly inventive community centres, at Waltham Forest housing action trust and Central Oakridge regeneration in Basingstoke.</p> <p>Bob also had a passion for designing, building and flying model aeroplanes, which led on to model gliders.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Jane Steele, whom he married in 1997, and their daughter, Phoebe; his daughters, Sophie and Jo, from his first marriage, to Katy (nee Stenhouse), which ended in divorce; and by five grandchildren, Otama, Evie, Manu, Poppy and Seb.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Intimate image abuse is a crisis in the UK – with a fortyfold increase in calls to this service since it opened in 2015. Thankfully, there are effective ways to help those being victimised</p>",
    "content": "<p>By midday, Jessica has dealt with five calls from highly distressed young women in their 20s, all close to tears or crying at the start of the conversations. She absorbs their alarm calmly, prompting them with questions, making sympathetic noises into her headset as she digests the situation. “Are these images sexual in nature?” she asks the last woman she speaks to before lunch. “Do you want to tell me a bit about what happened?” She begins compiling a tidy set of bullet points in ballpoint pen. “It’s all right. Take your time.”</p> <p>Jessica is sitting on a bank of desks with three other women, responding to calls to the <a href=\"https://revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">Revenge Porn Helpline</a>. For the past decade, the helpline has been offering advice to callers whose partners or exes have uploaded nude images or footage of them without their consent. “It’s a shocking time for you. I’m so sorry to hear what happened,” she says, as the caller explains that, just a few hours earlier, an ex-partner messaged her to tell her he had decided to post videos of them having sex on the OnlyFans website.</p> <p>“Have you called the police? And they haven’t got back to you?” She listens, looking out of the window towards a line of trees gently swaying at the edge of the car park. “That is unfortunate. We will do absolutely all we can to get that content removed for you.”</p> <p>The evolving work of the Revenge Porn Helpline acts as a useful mirror to the rapidly developing ways that people use the internet to inflict pain and misery, and make money. There has been a more than <a href=\"https://swgfl.org.uk/magazine/the-scale-of-non-consensual-intimate-image-ncii-abuse-a-data-driven-global-analysis/\">fortyfold increase</a> in calls since the service opened. And there has been a <a href=\"https://swgfl.org.uk/magazine/record-surge-in-intimate-image-abuse-reports-to-the-revenge-porn-helpline/\">20.9% increase</a> in reports throughout 2024. The helpline was launched by a small safer technology charity in 2015 (it is now government-funded), at a time when the simultaneous growth in people owning smartphones and the soaring use of social media gave rise to the unexpected problem of nude images being shared without consent. Originally, most callers were female, but by 2023, the balance had shifted, and more men got in touch than women. In its first year, staff handled 521 cases; last year, 22,264 people got in touch. At the current rate of increasing demand, staff expect to be responding to double that caseload by 2028.</p> <p>The variety of material they encounter is changing fast. A few callers are concerned that AI has been used to insert their faces into pornography performed by other people. In the helpline’s early years, this happened very occasionally, and was easy to detect. “The technology is so much better now that it can be very difficult to determine if footage is synthetic or genuine,” says Sophie Mortimer, the helpline manager. “People tell us: ‘That’s me, but I don’t remember it being filmed.’ It is very disconcerting to see that content and not know whether it’s real or not.”</p>    <p>Although the service remains known as a helpline for the victims of “revenge pornography”, staff deal with a wide range of issues, and are quietly apologetic about the service’s name – since the term suggests the victim has done something to provoke what has happened. In reality, revenge is not the only motivation for this behaviour, and sometimes material is posted by strangers. Many calls come from people who are being blackmailed by criminals who have entrapped them online.</p> <p>Opposite Jessica, another operator, Alice (both women have asked that their full names not be printed), is advising a man in his 30s who was encouraged into sharing an image of his genitals with a man he had met the night before on a dating platform. Instantly, the man switched from flirtation to extortion, threatening to share the image with a list of friends and relatives, contacts gathered from his victim’s social media accounts. “Have you blocked them?” she asks. “Yes, it is distressing. Are you feeling OK?”</p> <p>Despite the bleak content under discussion, a day in the helpline’s offices in a business park on the outskirts of Exeter ends up being unexpectedly positive. The staff, who are paid employees rather than volunteers, offer clear, practical advice and explain the constructive routes that can help people extract themselves from a range of desperate situations. Most callers are hugely reassured by the time they hang up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/07/britain-online-revenge-porn-image-abuse\">As a teenager, I was a victim of online ‘revenge porn’. Here’s how Britain should protect people like me | Isabel Brooks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jessica explains to her caller that the OnlyFans website is usually very responsive to requests for content to be taken down (the helpline has a 90.9% success rate in getting nonconsensual intimate material removed). She offers to help check whether the material has been posted elsewhere. “You’ll need to email in a photo and we can do a facial-recognition search through public websites.”</p> <p>After the call, Jessica tells me: “You can hear the relief in their voices when we tell them they’re not to blame. Often, there’s a sense of shame, a feeling that they shouldn’t have shared the images.” The reaction callers receive from the police is often quite different. “Unfortunately, the police will sometimes still say: ‘Why did you take those pictures in the first place?’ That self-blame gets reinforced. We explain that they are the victim of a crime and they can report it.”</p> <p>The helpline department is separated from the administrative side of the office by screens, with a sign by the entrance warning: “Caution. Content being reviewed”. On a pinboard, a graph shows the dramatic rise in demand for the helpline’s services. Employees have decorated the board with bawdy fridge magnets, keyrings and bottle openers shaped as breasts and penises, brought back from their holidays. A flesh-coloured, torso-shaped teacup with large breasts sits on the windowsill.</p>    <p>“It’s a very close team, very supportive of each other and what we’re trying to achieve. You develop a certain dark humour,” Mortimer says in explanation. The work is stressful, and employees have regular counselling sessions, but there is also a need to destigmatise the content under discussion, she adds. She told a government select committee earlier this year that during her nine years with the helpline, “the rules of romantic engagement as we knew them have changed”.</p> <p>“Alongside the increasing popularity of sexting, people have simply become much more comfortable exchanging nude images of themselves, regardless of age or gender,” she said. “And as long as you’re an adult, it’s consensual and it’s legal, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.”</p> <p>But for those who find that sexual images have been shared online without their consent, the impact can be life-shattering. One woman told the same committee that her full name had been published alongside the nonconsensual photographs, and this had made her life so complicated she had felt obliged to change her name by deed poll. At times, she wished she had been subjected to a physical sexual assault rather than an online one, so that “at least the replaying of the abuse would be within the privacy of their own head, rather than online for anyone to see”, the committee report noted.</p> <p>Another woman described the impact of this material remaining online as “exhausting”. “I am terrified of applying for jobs for fear the prospective employer will Google my name and see. I am terrified when meeting new people that they will Google my name and see,” she told MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee for their report into nonconsensual intimate image abuse, published earlier this year.</p>    <p>Reality TV star Georgia Harrison told the parliamentary inquiry about the impact of her ex-partner’s decision to share film of them having sex, which he had taken without her consent. “I always compare it with grief: you have to actually grieve a former version of yourself; you feel like you lose your dignity and a lot of pride, there is so much shame involved in it.”</p> <p>Staff at the helpline are under pressure to remove content quickly, before it is reshared. “It is really like a house fire: the quicker you can put it out, the quicker you can stop it,” Harrison explained to MPs, adding that she had not been alerted to the content in time. “Unfortunately, in four to six days, your house has burned down and it is just too late, everyone knows about this video: your family, your workplace, your peers. However, if you can get through to someone in the first 24 hours, you then have time to stop this going any further and potentially not ruining your life.”</p> <p>Once material is shared on smaller sites, or sites based outside the UK, it becomes harder to get it removed. Some perpetrators are prolific; staff have reported for removal more than 200,000 images of more than 150 women shared by one individual, but are struggling to get another 8,000 pictures posted by the same man taken down from noncompliant sites. While US legislation has made it easier to oblige companies to comply with take-down requests, sites based in Russia, South America and parts of Asia remain “pretty safe places if you want to set up a site trading in this sort of content”, Mortimer says.</p>    <p>The longer she has spent with the charity, the clearer she has become about the strong correlation between men who share nonconsensual images and coercive and controlling behaviour. “Sharing of these images doesn’t happen in isolation. The cases are often complex … often you find there was already abuse in the relationship. We do a lot of signposting to domestic abuse charities.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/what-are-the-new-uk-online-safety-rules-and-how-will-they-be-enforced\">Recent changes to legislation in the Online Safety Act</a> should make it easier to get nonconsensual intimate content removed. The government has made the creation of nonconsensual synthetic content (deepfakes) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-crackdown-on-explicit-deepfakes\">an offence in principle</a>, in the Data (Use and Access) Act, which received royal assent in June but is only partially in force as yet.</p> <p>In between calls, Jessica is responding to a stream of emails that have come in overnight, most of them about sextortion; staff have noticed these messages often come through in the early hours of the morning, when people have spent hours on their phones, chatting and sharing content. “You can sense the desperation in the messages. They’re saying: <em>please help me urgently</em>. They’ve been told: <em>if you don’t send the money by 7am, we will release the images</em>. We’re often the first people they get in touch with,” she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alice commends her caller for quickly blocking the blackmailer, and explains the organised criminal groups behind most of the sextortion attempts usually lose interest once it becomes clear no money is going to be transferred. It is rare that the sextortion images have already been uploaded. “The bargaining chip is lost as soon as they are shared,” she says. She tells him to go to the <a href=\"http://stopncii.org/\">stopncii.org</a> website, and create a <a href=\"https://stopncii.org/how-it-works/\">unique code, known as a hash</a>, out of the image he shared, so that a digital fingerprint for the photo can be created and added to a bank of nonconsensual images, which will then be blocked by most reputable partner sites if anyone attempts to upload them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/14/more-men-than-women-are-now-reporting-image-based-abuse-im-one-of-them\">More men than women are now reporting image-based abuse. I’m one of them | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not all mainstream internet companies are compliant with the hashing regime; Google has yet to sign up, although helpline staff are hopeful it will change its policy. (Google said in a statement that it is working with StopNCII to find solutions to help address this type of harmful content, and wanted to “make sure that interventions on our platform will work, and won’t lead to negative outcomes”.)</p> <p>“We hear from some people who have already sent thousands of pounds, but we explain that no money is ever enough once the criminals realise you are able and willing to pay,” Alice says. While sharing of nonconsensual intimate images is overwhelmingly (97%) an offence committed against women, 93% of the sextortion cases involve male victims. Staff cannot explain why this is, but say they have observed that women tend to be slower than men to engage in online sexual activity with strangers. Many of the perpetrators turn out to belong to criminal gangs, based abroad. Students and younger victims are typically asked for smaller sums of money; some people are asked to send an online gift card, because it can be less easy to trace.</p> <p>Staff know there has been a surge in pornographic deepfakes – artificially generated pornography using a real person’s face, mostly of women – citing research by the campaign group <a href=\"https://myimagemychoice.org/\">My Image My Choice</a>, which found more than 275,000 deepfake videos on the most popular sites in 2023, with more than 4 billion views, and with more videos uploaded to these sites that year than in all previous years combined. Sometimes, images are collected from people’s holiday pictures, bikini shots that they’ve posted on Instagram, and turned into porn, using easily downloadable apps. The use of nudification apps that use AI to remove someone’s clothes in an image or video clip is soaring; in March, the team reported 29 different undressing apps to Apple for blocking. The apps were removed, but staff are puzzled about why they were initially approved as products suitable for download.</p>    <p>Despite the global proliferation of this phenomenon, it is relatively rare for women to contact the helpline with this issue. Kate Worthington, the senior helpline practitioner, says a lot of the synthetic content is created for private sexual gratification rather than for shaming or hurting people. “The numbers are increasing but, with synthetic material, there isn’t always an intention of the victim knowing that the content has been generated. There is a collector culture side of things, where online spaces are used to sell, swap or trade intimate content, so that’s where they have been circulating. Women wouldn’t necessarily know their images are on these sites.”</p> <p>Before the end of her shift, Jessica takes a call from a woman who has been quoted £3,500 from a private company to remove nude images shared by an ex-partner that are now appearing on a variety of adult websites. “We would really recommend not doing that,” she advises. “You shouldn’t have to pay for the content to be removed. We’re a government-funded charity – that’s what we can do for you.” The caller is in tears by the end of the conversation, but these seem to be mainly tears of relief. “We can do regular searches to make sure the content has not been reuploaded. We’re here to support you for as long as you need.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">The Revenge Porn Helpline</a> can be called on 0345 6000 459.

    "description": "<p>Stocks of firms with big AI pushes tumbled this week, Meta announced an AI hiring freeze, and the first big test of an AI reality check looms</p>",
    "content": "<h2>The sudden AI cooling-off period</h2> <p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape.</p> <p>Drive down the 280 freeway in San Francisco and you might believe AI is everywhere, and everything. Nearly every billboard advertises an AI related product: “We’ve Automated 2,412 BDRs.” “All that AI and still no ROI?” “Cheap on-demand GPU clusters.” It’s hard to know if you’re interpreting the industry jargon correctly while zooming past in your vehicle.</p> <p>The signs are just one example of the tech industry’s en-masse pivot to AI, a technology that the executives who have the most to gain from it say will be universe-shifting, inevitable and unavoidable. In California’s tech heartland, every company is now an AI company, just like every company became a tech company sometime in the 2010s.</p> <p>But just beneath the surface of the breathless promotion of every startup’s AI prowess, cracks are beginning to appear. Some of AI’s biggest boosters, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, have warned that investors are overvaluing the potential returns on AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said at a private dinner with reporters. “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/759965/sam-altman-openai-ai-bubble-interview\">My opinion is yes.</a>”</p> <p>Altman’s statements coincided with a concession that OpenAI <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt5-launch-data-centers-investments/\">botched the roll-out</a> of the latest ChatGPT model – which he <a href=\"https://futurism.com/disastrous-gpt-5-sam-altman-hyping-up-gpt-6\">once promised</a> would be a significant improvement over the current GPT 4.5 model.</p> <p>Sure, Altman’s comments may have been geared at getting investors to consider not investing in his competitors. But there are other signs. Just this past week, a new study from MIT found that 95% of generative AI projects have <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\">delivered little to no growth in revenue</a>. And tech stocks of companies with huge AI pushes tumbled this week: Palantir saw a 9% drop in shares, Oracle saw a 5.8% drop, chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.5% and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices as well as semiconductor designer Arm each saw 5% or more drop in shares. Not even the possibility of lower interest rates, which <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/tech-stocks-magnificent-seven-losing-steam-e948af4d?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">buoyed stocks in other sectors</a> last week, was enough to turn around tech’s market slide.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just beneath the breathless promotion of AI, cracks are beginning to appear</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Meta, which had been reportedly spending billions to recruit the top AI talent, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgpOxxs8vMjkPbLVa21L8QvX6GPCDkDg27Ycg18_GJrIRv_lnxrLi51RXm6UFs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68a8d77b&amp;gaa_sig=TQSTt_34WFXNIwxp_2VMF9yMnm0-q3r07mZYVF5HLqKt0r-0TIhfWkMH9bRmtZiyvhPNNL0XJAW5N4liNCKKYA%3D%3D\">announced an AI hiring freeze</a>. Meta sought to downplay the news, with the company’s chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, posting on X last week: “We are truly only investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs as a company. Any reporting to the contrary of that is clearly mistaken.”</p> <p>The sudden AI cooling-off period comes just a week after many of these companies reported largely stellar earnings despite upping their expectation for how many billions they plan to spend on building out their AI capacity over the next few months and years. At the same dinner with reporters, Altman said he expected OpenAI to spend “trillions” on datacenter expansion in the “not very distant future”, according to the Verge.</p> <p>While the latest round of AI jitters is being framed as a sign that the AI hype bubble may soon burst, it’s perhaps more of a needed market correction – a reality check for investors who can’t see outside of the Silicon Valley echo chamber. Even the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that some of the laser focus on achieving artificial general intelligence – or the idea that AI could at some point match or surpass human intelligence – is misguided.</p> <p>“It is uncertain how soon artificial general intelligence can be achieved,” reads a column Schmidt co-wrote with China and AI policy lead Selina Xu. “We worry that Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists.” Schmidt and Xu spend much of the rest of the column boosting the benefits and milestones AI has already met but raising concerns about how the build-at-all-costs strategy Silicon Valley is taking in pursuit of a super-intelligent AI is not reflective of the reality for the general public.</p> <p>“There’s a widening schism between the technologists who feel the A.G.I. – a mantra for believers who see themselves on the cusp of the technology – and members of the general public who are skeptical about the hype and see A.I. as a nuisance in their daily lives,” they wrote.</p> <p>It’s unclear if the industry will take heed of these warnings. Investors look to every quarterly earnings report for signs that each company’s billions in capex spending is somehow being justified and executives are eager to give them hope. Boosting, boasting about and hyping the supposed promise and inevitability of AI is a big part of keeping investor concerns about the extra $10bn each company adds to its spending projections every quarter at bay. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, recently said in the future if you’re not using AI glasses you’ll be at a cognitive disadvantage much like not wearing corrective lenses. That means tech firms such as Meta and Google will probably continue making the AI features that they offer today an almost inescapable part of using their products in a play to boost their training data and user numbers.</p> <p>That said, the first big test of this AI reality check will come on Wednesday when chipmaker Nvidia – one of the building blocks of most LLMs – will report its latest earnings. Analysts seem pretty optimistic but after a shaky week for its stocks, investor reactions to Nvidia’s earnings and any updates on spending will be a strong signal of whether they have a continued appetite for the AI hype machine.</p> <h2>Have you bonded with an AI?</h2>    <p>Heavy ChatGPT users have formed strong emotional attachments to the AI, which means that, when it changes, they notice. In the case of OpenAI’s most recent update, the release of the AI model GPT-5, these users got upset. My colleague Dani Anguiano reports:</p> <p><em>“It was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” said Linn Vailt, a software developer in Sweden, about the update. “It’s like somebody just moved all of the furniture in your house.”</em></p> <p><em>ChatGPTquickly made adjustments, promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models – for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the importance of some features to its users.</em></p> <p>***<br><strong>Have you bonded with an AI?

My colleague Lauren Almeida reports:</p> <p><em>TikTok has put hundreds of UK content moderators’ jobs at risk, even as tighter rules come into effect to stop the spread of harmful material online.</em></p> <p><em>The viral video app said several hundred jobs in its trust and safety team could be affected in the UK, as well as south and south-east Asia, as part of a global reorganisation.</em></p> <p><em>In September, the company fired its entire team of 300 content moderators in the Netherlands. In October, it then announced it would replace about 500 content moderation employees in Malaysia as part of its shift towards AI.</em></p> <p><em>Last week, TikTok workers in Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/tiktok-trust-safety-team-moderators-ai\">held strikes</a> over layoffs in its trust and safety team, also the intended target of layoffs.</em></p> <p><strong>Read the full story:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/22/tiktok-uk-moderator-jobs-at-risk-despite-new-online-safety-rules\">Hundreds of TikTok UK moderator jobs at risk despite new online safety rules</a></p> <p>The cuts are part of a global push by the company towards moderating content with artificial intelligence. Automated systems already carry out some 85% of content removals on the app, according to TikTok. ByteDance, its parent company, seems to want to move the percentage upward.</p> <p>The company is not hemming and hawing about the importance of human oversight and insight into thorny issues. Business is booming, with a 38% increase in revenue in the UK and Europe, per regulatory filings. American tech giants are moving in the same direction, led by Meta’s disbandment of its fact-checking initiatives and Elon Musk’s deep cuts to the trust and safety teams at X.</p> <p>TikTokhas carried out <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-lays-staff-u-s-trust-safety-global-e-commerce-teams\">smaller-scale layoffs</a> of trust and safety teams in the United States. There have not been mass firings of content moderators. Why? Perhaps because any move that might elicit backlash would be dangerous at a moment when the official US attitude toward the app couldn’t be less clear. The White House created a TikTok account that launched last Tuesday. You may recall that the past two American presidents have tried to shut the app out of the US. The ban is still in place, held off only by flimsy executive orders extending a pause on its enforcement, which may only persist as long as Donald Trump’s goodwill does.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/ai-author-articles-wired-business-insider\">Wired and Business Insider remove articles by AI-generated ‘freelancer’</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/21/sunniest-cafe-paris-app-jveuxdusoleil\">There’s an app for that: finding a sunny cafe in Paris, the city of light</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/french-government-investigating-death-of-man-during-live-stream\">French streamer dies live online after months of apparent mistreatment</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/uk-has-backed-down-on-demand-to-access-us-apple-user-data-spy-chief-says\">UK has backed down on demand to access US Apple user data, spy chief says</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/microsoft-workers-protest-washington-israel\">Microsoft workers occupy HQ in protest against company’s ties to Israeli military</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/intel-stake-trump-chips-science-act\">US pursuing stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, commerce secretary says</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/openai-chatgpt-stock-sale-reports\">OpenAI eyes world’s largest valuation for private company in stock sale talks</a></p></li> </ul>",

    "description": "<p>Genetically modified lung functioned for nine days, in latest development in xenotransplantation aimed at solving organ shortage crisis</p>",
    "content": "<p>Surgeons have transplanted a lung from a genetically modified pig into a brain dead human recipient for the first time and found it functioned for nine days, researchers have revealed.</p> <p>The work is the latest development in a technique called xenotransplantation that is aimed at solving the organ shortage crisis: <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/30-05-2024-seventy-seventh-world-health-assembly---daily-update--30-may-2024\">according to the World Health Organization</a>, only up to 10% of the global need for such transplants is being met.</p> <p>However, experts have stressed there is a long way to go before pig lungs can be used in patients.</p> <p>Dr Justin Chan, a lung transplant surgeon for the NYU Langone Transplant Institute who was not involved in the work, described the study as “exciting and promising work”, but said the report concerned only one patient and was a “qualified success”.</p> <p>“These lungs are not able to independently sustain a patient,” he added.</p> <p>Andrew Fisher, a professor of respiratory transplant medicine at Newcastle University, agreed. “This work is very welcome in furthering our understanding, but it marks an incremental step forward. There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said.</p> <p>Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. The latter are typically genetically modified by removing certain pig genes and inserting specific human genes, to reduce rejection of the organs by the recipient’s body.</p> <p>Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies\">died within weeks or months</a> of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/xenotransplant-pig-kidney-patient\">some with transplanted pig kidneys have survived</a> with the organs still functioning several months after the procedure.</p> <p>But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky.</p> <p>“Every breath you breathe in is bringing the external environment into the body,” said Fisher. This means the lungs need to be very capable of responding to attacks from pollution, infection and other sources. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you’re dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don’t want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x\">Writing in the journal Nature Medicine</a>, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient.</p> <p>The team found the lung remained viable and functional over a 216-hour period and did not trigger hyperacute rejection – a rapid, violent immune response by the recipient’s body. There were also no signs of infection.</p> <p>However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time.</p> <p>“The impact of the damage was likely underestimated [because] the human recipient still had one of their own lungs present and this would have compensated for the damaged porcine lung,” said Fisher.</p> <p>Prof Peter Friend, from the University of Oxford, said the results were complicated by the fact brain death itself causes an acute inflammatory state. “So some of what they are seeing may be a function of the brain dead status of the recipient,” he said.</p> <p>The researchers behind the work said the approach needed to be refined.</p> <p>“Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote.</p> <p>Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells.</p> <p>Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/07/humanised-kidneys-grown-inside-pigs-for-the-first-time\">growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep</a>.</p> <p>Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used.</p> <p>“If we get that right, that’s something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said. </p>",

Also, note that E = J</p> <p>Now to the multiplications. We know that 2 × AB = FG = ninety-somthing. So A = 4. And since C x AB = DE, we can deduce that C is 1 or 2. (If it was 3 or larger C x AB would have threedigits.)</p> <p>Suppose C = 1. Then AB = DE, which means that D = A = 4. However, we know G must be even, since G = 2 x B, so D + G is even, but this contradicts D + G = 11. Hence C = 2 and D = F = 9. It follows that J = E = G = 2 and B = 6.</p>    <p><strong>3.

    "description": "<p>Elon Musk’s ambitious timetable for reaching the moon and conquering Mars left hanging in the balance</p>",
    "content": "<p>The launch of Elon Musk’s gargantuan Starship space rocket was scrubbed late on Sunday afternoon, with the billionaire entrepreneur’s ambitious timetable for reaching the moon and conquering Mars left hanging in the balance.</p> <p>SpaceX said it was standing down from the launch to “allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems”, a <a href=\"https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1959755893324865963\">post on social media</a> read. There was no information on when the launch would be rescheduled.</p> <p>This was Starship’s 10th launch attempt. Of its nine previous uncrewed outings, dating to April 2023, failures have outnumbered the successes. All three test flights this year ended in huge explosions and debris raining down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/spacex-starship-explodes-musk\">Caribbean islands</a> from the Bahamas to the Turks and Caicos in January and March, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/28/spacex-starship-rocket-launch-9th-test-flight-lost-contact\">Indian Ocean in May</a>.</p> <p>Sunday night’s test flight, from SpaceX’s sprawling complex in Starbase, Texas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/23/elon-musk-new-city-starbase-texas\">formerly known as Boca Chica</a>, had various mission objectives, including the first successful deployment of Starlink communications satellite simulators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/hawaii-elon-musk-spacex-rocket-debris\">Inside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Musk had remained uncharacteristically quiet ahead of the mission. “Getting ready to launch Starship,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1958614832665829421\">posted on Thursday</a> to the X platform he also owns, alongside images of the rocket assembly moving into position. SpaceX has not achieved a safe return landing of the upper stage of Starship, which Musk is hoping to have certified for human spaceflight as early as next year.</p> <p>SpaceX engineers have made a number of changes following reviews of the rocket’s previous failures, which include “a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/19/spacex-rocket-starship-36-explodes-texas-elon-musk-mars-project-setback\">catastrophic explosion</a>” that destroyed a Starship rocket during a ground test in June. The company is testing a variety of new heat-resistant tiles designed to stand the stresses of re-entry, and aims to return the upper stage to its landing site for the first time.</p> <p>The entire Starship stack, at 403ft (123 meters), is considerably larger and more powerful than Nasa’s Apollo-era Saturn V rocket that last took humans to the moon in 1972.</p> <p>Musk’s vision is a fully reusable space vehicle capable of repeated return trips to Mars <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/humanspaceflight/mars\">beginning in late 2026</a> without astronauts, then with crews making the six-month space voyage as early as 2029. Ultimately, the SpaceX and Tesla founder aims to build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/musk-humans-live-on-mars-spacex\">thriving city for humans</a> on the red planet in the coming two to three decades.</p> <p>Experts say it is a hugely ambitious undertaking. First, Musk needs to prove SpaceX can launch and recover Starship’s components safely from short hops into the atmosphere, to say nothing of a journey to the moon.</p> <p>Only four Starship launches have been considered successful, although the company has made progress in recovering the first-stage Super Heavy rocket booster by capturing it in a giant pair of robotic arms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/13/spacex-elon-musk-launches-and-lands-starship-rocket-in-first-test-of-giant-robotic-arms\">nicknamed the chopsticks</a>.</p> <p>SpaceX had said it would not attempt to catch the booster from Sunday’s flight because the component would instead be used for in-flight experiments “to gather real-world performance data on future flight profiles and off-nominal scenarios”.</p> <p>In the eyes of investors, the mission is also a test of Musk’s commitment to focusing on his core businesses – space and electric vehicles – since leaving his controversial government job as head of the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) in May. When he left the government, Musk said he would return to his businesses. He has since backtracked on the pledge and said he will start a new political party, though he may already be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-third-political-party-69bf9bd8?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAg02J4mcYNvtWWLYrbVsNniGgrs-5ojUjrnJgm6o6xPvB68Bdrry-21ygC2_fs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68a8e368&amp;gaa_sig=wos5KD0TrAf7pJLgu-WCVSqrqP3_vVsYCSElUaA95uEoQ3VSDq19RX1xt9L3H9fz5Q1yidztQmHEZt5m73Vdkw%3D%3D\">backing off the initiative</a>.</p> <p>Ethics watchdogs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/elon-musk-conflicts-of-interest\">questioned Musk’s former role for the White House</a>, in which he slashed tens of thousands of government jobs in the name of efficiency while preserving and benefiting from billions of dollars in federal contracts.</p> <p>Donald Trump said this month he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-order-rocket-launches-musk-bezos\">planned to relax regulations</a> that will allow Musk, and fellow billionaires with space ambitions such as the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, to avoid reviews previously required by the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) before launch permits can be granted.</p> <p>Authorities and environmentalists have expressed concerns over the environmental impacts of SpaceX operations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/mexico-president-lawsuit-spacex-debris-rocket-explosions\">in Mexico</a>, after the explosion near its border in June, and in Hawaii, where authorities and environmentalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/hawaii-elon-musk-spacex-rocket-debris\">fear the impact on its sensitive marine ecosystem</a> from new rules that will allow Musk to launch 25 Starship flights from Texas instead of just five.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In August, track down the constellation of Hercules, the hero. It is well placed from the northern hemisphere at this time of year, but finding it requires a little bit of celestial sleuthing owing to the fact that the constellation contains no really bright stars. Once seen, however, it seems to dominate its patch of the night sky.</p> <p>The chart shows the view looking west-south-west from London on 25 August at 10pm BST. The constellation’s most recognisable feature is the four stars making up the keystone shape that represents Hercules’s body.</p> <p>The constellation was one of the 48 constellations defined by Ptolemy in the second century. In the myths of classical antiquity, Hercules was Zeus’s son. Immensely strong but murderously temperamental, Hercules was taught responsibility by the Oracle of Delphi, who set him 12 tasks. The completion of these tasks absolved his crimes and elevated him to hero status.</p> <p>When tracking him down, bear in mind that the constellation is large, spanning the fifth-largest area of all the 88 modern constellations.</p> <p>From the southern hemisphere, Hercules appears in the north during the evening. The farther south, the lower the constellation appears. From Sydney, Australia, for example, Hercules just rises above the northern horizon by mid- to late evening.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Social media is helping drive trade in skulls, bones and skin products as UK legal void risks new era of ‘body snatching’</p>",
    "content": "<p>“When it comes to human stuff, I’ll take anything, pretty much,” says Henry Scragg. “As long as it’s been ethically sourced, may I add.”</p> <p>Speaking from his macabre curiosities shop in Essex in a recent YouTube interview, Scragg wears a shabby bowler hat, has tribal-style face tattoos and a ginger beard that descends into three pendulous dreadlocks.</p> <p>The shop, Curiosities from the 5th Corner, provides a backdrop that could be plucked straight from a Victorian penny dreadful: a foetus of conjoined twins floats in a large medical jar at Scragg’s elbow, shelves of human skulls and a hybrid animal skeleton loom behind. The shop’s website markets a monthly human skull subscription (buyers are sent a skull of the shop’s choice each month), mummified body parts, shrunken heads, and masks and wallets made from human leather.</p>    <p>There is no suggestion the sale of these items is illegal, but experts, including Dame Sue Black, one of the UK’s leading forensic scientists, are calling for a crackdown on the trade in human remains. </p> <p>They say the lack of regulation means much of the buying and selling of skulls and bones falls into a legal grey zone; and that the growing online market risks fuelling a new era of “body snatching”, with reports of bones being removed from crypts and graveyards <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/18/ancient-human-skulls-stolen-crypt-kent-7733395/\">in the UK</a> and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-12/100-year-old-human-remains-stolen-from-a-crypt-in-colorado\">abroad</a>.</p> <p>“You’ve got people who are breaking into mausolea and who are taking remains away to sell them for people who think this is gothic, quaint [or] supernatural,” said Black, the president of St John’s College, Oxford. “If you can make the sale of a bird’s nest illegal, surely to goodness you can make the sale of a human body illegal. Having a necklace made out of somebody’s teeth isn’t acceptable to people.”</p> <p>One problem, experts say, lies in how laws are applied. In the UK, desecrating a grave is an offence, but the remains are not technically property so they cannot legally be “owned” or “stolen”. This means it would not automatically be a crime to possess or sell historical human remains, even if they had been unlawfully exhumed.</p> <p>“It’s gruesome,” said Black. “It’s why we say ‘Rest in peace.’ You don’t expect your body to be dug up and sold.”</p> <p>Dr Trish Biers, from the department of anthropology at the University of Cambridge, coordinates a taskforce at the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology (BABAO) that investigates the sale and trade of human remains. She said there had been a substantial increase in sales in the UK in recent years. In the past five years, the BABAO had blocked more than 200 sales, including from auction houses, shops and online sellers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can’t take photos of remains under 100 years old for medical research … but it’s OK to turn a child’s spine into a handbag handle</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Trish Biers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the market has long been dominated by ex-medical skulls and former museum exhibits, Biers suggested there had been an increase in the sale of skulls described as “archaeological”, the appearance of which is consistent with having been excavated from the ground or exhumed from coffins.</p> <p>“Social media has completely changed the market,” she said. “It’s not illegal and that’s the problem.”</p> <p>Similar concerns were raised in March by Mattaeus Ball, a Reading-based trader in “macabre art and oddities” who recently announced he was no longer trading in human remains.</p> <p>“The waters are becoming too muddy with stolen pieces, pieces that are grave-robbed, so many things that just aren’t right,” he said in an Instagram post. “And people keep thinking I’m dealing in that, when I’m not.” Ball declined to be interviewed.</p> <p>The Guardian showed images of 10 skulls found on sale on Instagram and other UK online forums to three forensic experts. Several were judged to be ex-anatomical teaching skulls, but others appeared to be coated with dirt or traces of human tissue, which could indicate more recent excavation.</p> <p>One skull, being sold for £995 on a Belfast-based website, showed signs of root damage, suggesting it had been buried in soil. One expert identified “patches of what could be darker organic matter, possible rootlets in the sutures and orbits, possible rodent gnawing”. The owner of the site said roots and rodents were not the cause of damage.</p> <p>Another skull, missing several teeth and marketed for £795 on the website of a UK-based shop, appeared to have manganese oxide staining, the Guardian was told, which is consistent with that seen in bodies excavated from old graves.</p> <p>At least three skulls showed evidence of softening, which occurs when bones are submerged in the acidic material created by decomposition inside a coffin. One of these appeared to have recent damage around the face and a dark, thin, flaky layer “which is what I have seen in skulls that have been taken from coffins”, said Black. “The white areas tell you that it is recent damage as it exposes the non-coloured bone below.”</p> <p>Dr Nicholas Marquez-Grant, a forensic anthropologist at Cranfield University, said that, based on anatomical features, some of the skulls probably originated from outside the UK, including Asia and Africa, and may date as far back as the 19th century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you dig up a human skull … you could hand it to a museum. They’ve already got loads of them so they don’t need any more</p> <footer> <cite>Henry Scragg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paul Boateng, who will meet the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, next month to appeal for a change in the law, has raised specific concerns about the trade in remains of ancestors from Indigenous communities. “The continual trade in human beings even after death, and their continued objectification even after death, is deeply repugnant and a source of shame to our country,” he said.</p> <p>Most private trade in human remains falls beyond the remit of the Human Tissue Act 2004, created after the Alder Hey scandal in which children’s organs were removed and stored at the hospital without consent. The act, which enshrines legal requirements around consent, storage and use, covers only remains that are under 100 years old. It also only applies to specific uses, including organ transplants, scientific research and “public display”, which includes museums but which experts say is not routinely interpreted as applying to images shared on social media by sellers.</p> <p>It means that, while medical research is tightly regulated, collectors and sellers are in effect free to buy, sell and modify human remains, provided they did not acquire them illegally and are not using them for transplant.</p> <p>“I have to have a licence to curate remains,” Biers said. “You can’t take photos of any human remains under 100 years old if you go to Barts pathology [department]. But it’s OK to turn a child’s spine into a handbag handle. I don’t understand this.”</p>    <p>“The private use of these things is in a legal void,” says Imogen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Leeds. She suggested recent cases, such as that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/28/david-fuller-hospital-failings-necrophiliac-murderer-offend-inquiry\">mortuary abuser David Fuller,</a> showed UK law did not reflect the general expectation that dead bodies and body parts should be “treated with a baseline level of dignity respect across all sectors”.</p> <p>In the podcast interview, Scragg appears to acknowledge some older skulls may have been recently excavated, either to make room for new burials or by other legal means. “When you dig up a human skull, what are you going to do with it? You could hand it to a museum. They’ve already got loads of them so they don’t need any more.”</p> <p>Selling a skull to “people who will look after it, appreciate it, and put it on a shelf and love it”, he adds, could be viewed as “more respectful than burying it six foot under”.</p> <p>Other online sellers described coming into possession of bones found by construction or sewage contractors, although few gave the exact provenance. Scragg declined to comment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “All human remains should be treated with respect and dignity. We expect auction houses to scrutinise their activities and for anyone trading in human remains to consider carefully the ethical implications of this activity, which many understandably find deeply disturbing.”</p> <p>A DCMS source said the theft of any remains would be “an act of repugnant desecration” and that they would expect the police to act “using the full force of the law”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Human Tissue Authority said the actions of anyone undertaking activities using human tissue that fall within its regulatory remit should be guided by the principles of “consent, dignity, quality, and honesty and openness”.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It is hailed as a global endeavour to explore the hidden universe – a powerful telescope comprising more than 130,000 antennae <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/are-we-alone-in-the-universe-work-begins-in-western-australia-on-worlds-most-powerful-radio-telescope\">being built in outback Western Australia</a>.</p> <p>Along with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/17/first-image-from-south-african-super-radio-telescope-far-better-than-expected\">sister telescope in South Africa</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/square-kilometre-array\">Square Kilometre Array Observatory</a> is a €2bn (A$3.6bn) project tasked with mapping the first billion years of the universe.</p> <p>One day, the SKAO’s antennae – which look like metal Christmas trees scattered across the desert – could confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, prove Einstein’s theory of relativity and explain how galaxies have evolved over time.</p> <p>But while the venture is being lauded as one of the most significant scientific endeavours of the 21st century, the Guardian can reveal that the organisation managing the funds of 16 member states has been rocked by allegations of financial misconduct.</p> <p>The organisation has denied any wrongdoing.</p>    <p>The Australian government contribution to the SKAO has blown out by more than $150m from 2020 to 2024 compared with its initial budget, with the additional expenditure partly attributed to funding shortfalls for the project.</p> <p>In March this year, as the telescope in Australia captured its first images of faraway galaxies using just 1% of its capacity, a former senior employee of the project was filing a “protected disclosure” report calling for an investigation into the SKAO’s financial management.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/are-we-alone-in-the-universe-work-begins-in-western-australia-on-worlds-most-powerful-radio-telescope\">‘Are we alone in the universe?’: work begins in Western Australia on world’s most powerful radio telescopes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an intergovernmental organisation, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory is not subject to national laws or regulatory oversight in Australia where the employee is based, so the complaint went directly to the organisation’s global chair, the Italian astrophysicist Filippo Maria Zerbi.</p> <p>The concerns outlined in the disclosure had previously been raised with senior staff internally.</p> <p>In response to the whistleblower’s report, an email from Zerbi – sent in May 2025 and seen by the Guardian – confirms the organisation is conducting an external independent evaluation of the litany of allegations made against it. </p> <p>The email states that the chair is taking “all necessary actions” in response to the concerns raised, and given the volume of disclosed information, “further external and independent investigation into specific elements is necessary before reaching any conclusions and proceeding with the next steps”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The whistleblower has also raised concerns with the financial reporting council in the UK where the SKAO is headquartered, claiming the structure of the organisation had created a “regulatory blind spot” that had allowed for the “systematic deception of 16 sovereign governments”.</p> <p>The Square Kilometre Array Observatory was established by an international treaty in 2019, endowing it with special legal status; it is immune from normal legal processes and exempt from paying tax. International staff employed on the project in Australia are hired on diplomatic visas.</p>    <p>While the UK and Australia are majority shareholders in the project, the total financial contributions of each member nation are not disclosed.</p> <p>The Australian government announced in 2021 that it would contribute $387m to the SKAO over a decade for the construction and operation of the telescope, with $141m committed over the four-year forward estimates.</p> <p>At the time, the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the project would “help our scientists make more discoveries than we can imagine today, whether it’s better understanding the origin and future of our stars and galaxies, to how gravity works across the universe”.</p> <p>Portfolio budget statements for the Department of Industry, Science and Resources published since show the total amount spent is substantially more than this, with a total spend of $475m from 2021 to 2025.</p> <p>A department spokesperson said the additional spending included Australia’s member state contributions to the SKAO Observatory and “Australia’s other commitments to the SKA project, including investment in the Australian SKA Regional Centre and site readiness and local communities”.</p> <p>“Part of the investment is also leveraging the Australian SKA site’s fibre optic connection to provide connectivity for two communities nearby to the site – the Pia Wadjarri Remote Aboriginal Community and the Murchison Settlement,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>The amount spent between 2020 and 2024 was $164m more than initially budgeted in 2020.</p> <p>The spokesperson said there had been changes to the administered budgeted expenses for the SKA project “due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, adjustments to economic parameters, and the reprofiling of funds as part of regular updates to budget estimates”.</p> <p>In the 2025-26 budget, the government announced an additional $47.9m in the budget’s contingency reserve “to address funding shortfalls for the SKA project” alongside other member nations.</p> <p>In response to the disclosure, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, Zerbi has initiated an investigation into claims that public funds from member states have been lost through trading accounts – and then covered up by the organisation through the shuffling of funds internally.</p> <p>At the centre of the misconduct allegations is a claim that at least £12m (A$25.1m) was lost through investment in three money market funds, with one fund allegedly losing 45% of its value. The Guardian has seen balance sheet extracts and statements that appear to confirm the investments by the SKAO, which is headquartered at the Jodrell Bank Observatory near Manchester.</p> <p>The report also calls for an investigation into claims funds are being shifted within the organisation, and currency fluctuations being fabricated to conceal these losses from the governing council overseeing the project.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the SKAO denied the allegations, but confirmed it was “assisting an independent, external investigation” into them.</p> <p>“No capital loss has been incurred in these investment holdings. Money market funds are inherently low-risk, highly liquid investments and were selected for SKAO’s investment portfolio for this reason,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“Any reduction seen in the investment balances relates to amounts being redeemed (withdrawn) from the investments to support SKAO’s normal cash requirements, for example to pay suppliers and staff salaries.”</p> <p>“SKAO follows recognised best practice, and its financial activities and reports are subject to rigorous internal audits and independent external audits which are reported to Finance Committee and Council. No adverse findings of note have been reported.”</p>    <p>Other complaints detailed in the whistleblower’s report include allegations that procurement budgets have been mismanaged, leading to delays and change in scope.</p> <p>One example is the project’s failure to build a permanent power supply to the telescope at the Australian site, which is now being run on temporary diesel generators.</p> <p>The SKAO website claims power for the project’s central processing plant “is provided by a photovoltaic plant [solar] and energy storage system backed up by diesel generators, generating renewable energy a majority of the time to power the antennas and all site infrastructure”.</p> <p>However, no solar plant has yet been built. The project is yet to award a tender for the power plant and is allegedly spending more than $1m a year on diesel to power the plant.</p> <p>A tender document published by the SKAO in March reveals that a “phase one” diesel-operated system for the site is “expected to be operational in early 2026”, with the tender seeking interest to build a “phase two” power plant to integrate renewable energy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The scope and schedule of the SKA project, a massive undertaking to deliver the world’s two largest and most complex radio telescopes, are under constant review</p> <footer> <cite>SKAO spokesperson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The SKAO spokesperson confirmed that the project would be running on diesel generators until the long-term solar-based plant was operational – expected in late 2028.</p> <p>“An expert team is implementing a complex multi-stage power procurement process that will result in a long-term power purchase agreement with an independent power provider to build and operate a radio quiet power station with a very high fraction of power generated from solar photovoltaic cells and using a substantial battery energy storage system.”</p> <p>The Guardian can also reveal that<strong> </strong> a €5m European Commission grant claimed by the SKAO consortium for infrastructure development was partially clawed back.</p> <p>A letter sent from the European Research Executive Agency to the UK-based deputy director general of the SKAO, Simon Berry, indicates that the commission was seeking repayment of €3.4m that had already been paid.</p> <p>It is understood that the amount ultimately recognised by the European Commission was €2.5m of the original €5m grant after many of the claimed costs were deemed ineligible.</p> <p>The grant, allocated under the Horizon 2020 program, had been intended to support “the detailed design of the infrastructure required” for the telescope sites in Australia and South Africa.</p>    <p>The SKAO spokesperson said the grant had been overseen by the SKA organisation – the predecessor company to the SKAO that is in the process of being wound up.</p> <p>“As is often the case, with a complex major project of this sort, there were some costs deemed ineligible, but by the closeout of the project these were modest in nature and the arrangements resolved amicably between all the project partners and the EC, with the full knowledge and approval from the Organisation’s governance structures,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>An “internal update” circulated within the organisation in early July suggests there have also been changes to the project’s scope and schedule<strong>.</strong> </p> <p>According to the update, a “programme and schedule risk review” had established “extensions to our Mid and Low schedules”. (“Low” refers to the Australian telescope, while “Mid” refers to the project in South Africa.)</p> <p>The document also refers to a “budget gap” that will be assessed over the coming months. “Then we’ll look at how we can manage this, through reducing or deferring some of our scope.”</p> <p>The circular states that the organisation is aware that “our current contingency budget is insufficient to cover the expected ECPs [engineering change proposals] and remaining risk” of the project.</p> <p>In response to questions from the Guardian about the project’s changed scope, the SKAO spokesperson said: “The scope and schedule of the SKA project, a massive undertaking to deliver the world’s two largest and most complex radio telescopes, are under constant review.</p> <p>“SKAO Council, comprising representatives of the governments of the member states that make up SKAO and supported by its Finance Committee, has oversight of all such issues. A recent schedule update has been notified to Council and the wider scientific community, and is driven by programmatic not financial reasons,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pointer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

    "content": "<p>My friend Michael Waldman, who has died aged 83, was a palaeontologist and an inspiring teacher of geology. He discovered one of the most productive and important fossil sites in Scotland, and named several new species of extinct animals.</p> <p>Mike discovered the fossil site in 1971, during a Duke of Edinburgh school trip that he was co-leading to Skye. There, near the village of Elgol, he found the first mammal fossil from the time of dinosaurs in Scotland, named <em>Borealestes serendipitus</em>, “the northern rogue found by serendipity”. On subsequent trips, he and colleagues discovered fossil skeletons of fish, salamanders, lizards, turtles and mammals from the Middle Jurassic, some of the most complete examples of their kind in the world.</p> <p>With fellow palaeontologists he published several papers in the 1990s on the reptile and amphibian fossils. In 2009, one of the first vertebrate fossils to be named using Scottish Gaelic, <em><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2664364/\">Eileanchelys waldmani</a></em>, meaning “Waldman’s island turtle”, was given in his honour.</p>    <p>Mike was born in south-west London, to Rose (nee Pushkin), a secretary, and Max Waldman, who was in banking. Max died when Mike was eight years old.</p> <p>After attending Haberdashers’ Aske’s school in north London, Mike studied geology and zoology at the University of Bristol, graduating in 1963. He married Hazel Mills, a primary school teacher, in 1965, the day before setting sail for Australia to do a PhD at Monash University, Melbourne. His dissertation was on Cretaceous fish fossils from Koonwarra, Victoria, and he named several new genera and species.</p> <p>The couple then moved to Canada, where Mike studied fossils from the Canadian Badlands as a fellow at a museum in Ottawa.</p> <p>In 1970 they returned to Britain, and Mike worked briefly as a research assistant at Bristol University before becoming a geology teacher at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>He was very popular there, renowned for his enormous rock collection and known affectionately as “Doc Pot”. His contagious enthusiasm led many to pursue careers in geology, and he continued to receive postcards of rock formations and volcanoes from former pupils for years.</p> <p>He retired from teaching in 2002, but continued to support young academics. I met him in 2016 during my PhD at National Museums Scotland, when I was working on his mammal fossils from Skye. His Scottish discoveries sparked decades of research that continues to this day.</p> <p>He is survived by Hazel, his children, Penny, Amanda and Ben, and grandchildren, Phoebe, Isaac, Henry and Gracie.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Charity says it is ‘outrageous’ tooth stem cell procedures are being advertised with claims about ‘treating’ autism</p>",
    "content": "<p>Companies are making thousands of pounds by misleading parents with claims that collecting stem cells from their children’s teeth can be a treatment for diabetes and autism, an investigation has found.</p> <p>Tooth stem cell banking, also known as dental pulp cell banking, involves parents collecting and sending lost milk teeth to a laboratory where stem cells are harvested from the dental pulp. Firms that advertise tooth banking services claim these stem cells can be used in treatments for conditions such as diabetes as well as for autism.</p> <p>The investigation, by Emma Wilkinson and <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1491\">published in the BMJ</a>, found that three companies in the UK offer tooth stem cell banking – BioEden, Future Health Biobank and Stem Protect. The service costs about £1,900, with a £95 annual storage fee.</p> <p>On its website, Future Health Biobank <a href=\"https://futurehealthbiobank.com/stem-cell-banking/dental-pulp-cell-banking/\">says it has released 26 tooth stem cell samples for treatment</a>, including for autism, type 1 diabetes and knee cartilage regeneration. Stem Protect <a href=\"https://www.stemprotect.co.uk/dental-pulp/\">states on its website</a> that tooth stem cells can be used for cleft palate repair and HIV/Aids among other conditions, and says “medical trials into autism and cerebral palsy involve the pulp found inside teeth and offer hope for hundreds of conditions”.</p> <p>BioEden’s website claimed stem cell therapy had been described as the “next frontier” for treating both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and that the company had “already witnessed the remarkable evidence of these ongoing developments” among its customers.</p> <p>However, experts have expressed doubts about the medical value of tooth stem cell banking.</p> <p>“There is a lack of evidence and a paucity of research using dental pulp stem cells to treat patients,” said Jill Shepherd, a senior lecturer in stem cell biology at the University of Kent. “There’s no evidence to suggest stem cells stored from a child’s milk tooth would ever be needed to treat that child.”</p> <p>Sufyan Hussain, an investigator on the UK arm of a global clinical trial evaluating stem cell therapy, said there was not a definitive answer regarding the “optimal source of stem cells for future diabetes therapies”.</p> <p>“This highlights how emotive this matter can be, as parents naturally want the best possible outcomes for their children,” Hussain said. “While we remain hopeful about future treatments, there is also a risk that companies might exploit these hopes to generate additional revenue.”</p> <p>Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the National Autistic Society in the UK, said it was “outrageous” that tooth stem cell procedures are being advertised to parents with the claim of “treating” autism.</p> <p>He added: “Autism is not a disease or illness; it cannot be treated and there is no cure. It is dangerous and morally bankrupt to target potentially vulnerable people with expensive procedures that could, in fact, cause harm.”</p> <p>In response to the BMJ article, Future Health Biobank said it was looking at how information on its site is presented in order to ensure “readers can clearly distinguish between client experiences and formally published clinical outcomes”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Stem Protect said: “We have made no unfounded claims, and our website has been reviewed and approved by the Human Tissue Authority. We remain committed to ensuring stem cell banking is presented as a valuable resource, backed by evidence and transparency.”</p>",
